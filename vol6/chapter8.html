<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The practice of magic in Oceanic societies is based on the belief
that ultimate power resides in the ghosts of the ancestors, and that
there are people in the community who can summon this power under
certain conditions to achieve particular ends.</p>
<p>Magic traditionally imbued every aspect of the lives of Oceanic
speakers. It was the tool by which they sought to enhance outcomes in
their gardening practices, their fishing, their state of health, their
fertility, their efforts in love and war, and power over their enemies.
It provided an explanation for otherwise inexplicable events, and served
as a form of social control, enforcing prohibitions on certain
behaviours. But like all tools, it could be misused by those with their
own motives. It offered a means of reacting, attempting to influence, by
counter-action or retribution, and was used for both good and evil
purposes. Sorcery, sometimes used loosely as a term for any magic, more
commonly refers to that performed to inflict harm on another. In its
most extreme form it is magic directed towards the intended death of a
victim (black magic). Where possible, black magic is treated here
separately in <a href="../contributions/6-8#s-8-4">§8.4</a>.</p>
<p>Most approaches made to ancestors, as well as giving thanks and
perhaps showing respect and obeisance, are to seek their good will for
future endeavours. Approaches are invariably made at the start of fresh
initiatives such as the breaking of new ground in a garden, the opening
of a new men’s house, the construction and launching of a trading canoe,
preparation for a fight, and preparation for hunting and fishing
expeditions. Rituals on such occasions usually incorporate a sequence of
specific spells. For example, in preparation for a fight, spells may be
cast to inspire the warriors with courage, to enable them to creep upon
the enemy unobserved, to cause the weapons to inflict lethal wounds, and
to make the enemy sluggish and weak. In gardening, magic may be called
on to preserve the fences, drive away plant diseases and insects, bring
sun or rain, and make the yams increase in size (Hogbin 1964:86). The
ritual is usually so closely identified with the occasion that to
neglect it is to court disaster. In western Oceanic communities such
rituals are typically led by a headman or expert magician. Spells also
exist for individuals to seek good fortune in personal matters, such as
attracting a person of the opposite sex, help in childbirth or success
in fishing. At times the request is accompanied by offerings, usually
harvest produce or fish.</p>
<p><a id="p-250"></a></p>
<p>Misadventure of all kinds, including illness, accidents such as
falling from a tree, failure of rainfall or even volcanic activity can
be interpreted as due to displeasure of the ancestors, and must be
counteracted by magic, often accompanied by some form of payment. An
afflicted person may seek to identify a past act suspected of causing
offence, which can then be atoned. Commonly, misfortune is believed
caused by deliberate human action against another, i.e. sorcery. In this
case the victim may have a good idea of someone he or his close kin have
offended, or know of those who hold a grudge against him, and he may
have a good idea of those with the ability to practise sorcery and
identify the likely sorcerer. Those with the skill to cause harm usually
have the power to undo their magic.</p>
<p>A major problem for those of us engaged in historical reconstruction
is paucity of detailed terminology in magical matters. Many early
ethnographers were missionaries who could be expected to discourage any
magical beliefs as incompatible with Christianity, and did little to
record what they saw of magic practice. What was recorded was often
local practice reinterpreted to accord with Christian ritual and belief.
Also relevant was a natural reticence when it came to discussing secret
and mysterious processes with strangers. If a secret spell is shared
among strangers, its efficacy is believed lost. It may take years for an
outsider living within a community to be allowed to know of such
matters. Raymond Firth who spent a year in Tikopia in 1928–9, learnt
much later that the chiefs had given orders that he was to be told
nothing about their gods and ritual practices (1957:8). As well,
communities took care to keep this knowledge to themselves lest it be
used by neighbouring communities against them. So although there is a
substantial degree of commonality in what is known about the general
practice of magic in Melanesia, collected terms tend to be highly
restricted in distribution and very generalised in their listed meaning.
Consequently very few POc lexical reconstructions have been
possible.</p>
<p>As an example of the kind of difficulties involved, one of the rare
reconstructions possible is the following. It evidently related to some
aspect of magic, but without further evidence we cannot know if the
reference is generic or specific, or whether the implied actor is human
or non-human.</p>

<p>The practice of magic is considered in <a

<p><a id="p-251"></a></p>
<p><a id="s-2"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-practice">2. The practice</h2>
<p>Magic practice consists primarily in the recitation of certain spells
and performance of associated ritual. Depending on the kind of magic, it
may also involve inclusion of some substance to transmit the power from
the magician to the object to be influenced, and may be accompanied by
offerings.</p>
<p><a id="s-2-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="the-invocation">2.1. The invocation</h3>
<p>The reciting of a spell effectively invokes the ancestral spirits. It
seems that although anyone may talk to the ancestors, most major areas
of concern involve established spells typically ‘owned’ by a particular
person or clan. The wording of a spell is usually of great importance,
having been passed down by previous generations, perhaps originating in
a single named ancestor.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Malinowski1948">Malinowski</a> (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1948">1948</a>:54) writes of the Trobrianders
that “the most important element in magic is the spell. … In an analysis
of any act of witchcraft it will always be found that the ritual centres
round the utterance of the spell. The formula is always the core of the
magical performance.” He echoes <a
href="../sources/Powdermaker1933">Powdermaker</a> (<a
href="../sources/Powdermaker1933">1933</a>:298) who writes that, in Lesu
(New Ireland), the power of the magic lies in the muttered spell. The
rite is of minor significance, and sometimes does not exist, but the
spoken words are essential. In Longgu “the verbal formula of the spell
is always rhythmical to facilitate learning and subsequent recall, and,
as absolute accuracy in repetition is considered essential, it often
abounds in archaisms” (Hogbin 1964:86). Similarly, in To’aba’ita, <a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">1970</a>a:119) writes that “by far the most
important part of the magic is the spell, and the same word,
<em>akaloa</em>, is in fact used for both. All spells are supposed to
have been revealed in dreams to the ancestors by forefathers still more
remote, and their effectiveness is supposed to depend on the accuracy
with which they are repeated.” In Samoa, as described by <a
href="../sources/Moyle1988">Moyle</a> (<a
href="../sources/Moyle1988">1988</a>:73) “the possibility of success
required exact recitation of the text and an actual performance of the
ritual acts.”</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">1935</a>:479), however, writes that in
northern Bougainville the deed is more important than the words. “While
the deed is often sufficient without the word, the word is never found
alone, but always in conjunction with some act … Further, no great
stress appears to be laid upon the exact reproduction of the form of
words.” <a href="../sources/Firth1967">Firth</a> (<a
href="../sources/Firth1967">1967</a>:203, 206) writes that, although the
essence of the magic is the formula, “there is no belief in Tikopia that
the form of words is so exact that a slip in the recital will invalidate
their effect or bring misfortune upon the reciter … There is a great
deal of individual variation in the words recited.”</p>
<p>Although the main focus of the spell will be the desired outcome,
persons’ names may be included. In Mekeo, for instance, a spell includes
a sequence of names beginning with the name of the originator and ending
with the name of the person who taught the spell to the adept (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>a:59). In Longgu a spell
will contain a list of former owners, the list being proof of the
spell’s potency for the present owner; otherwise they would never have
continued to pass it down through the generations (Hogbin 1964:87).</p>
<p>The structure is repetitious. Longer spells may be in rhythmical
language, being easier to remember, often with figures of speech and
far-fetched analogies. <a href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">1970</a>b:177) offers as an example a spell
from Wogeo to make a canoe sail swiftly which describes it as travelling
faster than the flight of an eagle. The manner of utterance may also be
of importance. Spells are typically uttered inaudibly to prevent anyone
else learning them. Some may be sung.</p>
<p><a id="p-252"></a></p>
<p>Although it is possible to locate various terms meaning ‘to invoke
supernatural intervention’ or similar, a POc reconstruction has proved
elusive. <a href="../sources/Codrington1891">Codrington</a> (<a
href="../sources/Codrington1891">1891</a>:145) wrote “It is certainly
very difficult, if not impossible, to find in any Melanesian language a
word which directly translates the word prayer, so closely does the
notion of efficacy cling to the form employed.” A number of
phonologically similar low-level reconstructions are possible, but it
has proved impossible to combine the data into a single cognate set.</p>

<p>At first glance, the items listed below form an EOc cognate set.
Certainly their glosses justify one. But PNCV <em>*[ta]taro</em>
reflects a putative PEOc <em>*taro</em> or, less probably,
<em>*taRo</em>. PPn <em>*[talo]talo</em>, on the other hand, would
reflect a PEOc <em>*talo</em>. And ’Are’are <em>aro-a</em> might reflect
either <em>*taro</em> or <em>*talo</em>, so we cannot tell whether it is
cognate with PNCV <em>*[ta]taro</em> or with PPn <em>*[talo]talo</em>.

<h3 id="the-rite">2.2. The rite</h3>
<p>Rituals are intended to incorporate some aspect of the focussed
object. The degree of ritual action required, however, varies with
context. In Tikopia, where fishing is concerned, it is sufficient for a
man to utter appropriate words while the casting of a line provides the
necessary action (<a href="../sources/Firth1967">Firth 1967</a>:201).
When the focus is on, for example, success in gardening, the
accompanying ritual may assume the greater significance. Even when
similar rituals are described in the ethnographic literature, there is
little linguistically that can be reconstructed. An exception is with
magic associated with treatment of pain or disease. The spraying of some
masticated substance such as ginger mixed with saliva from the mouth on
to an affected body part is evidently a very old and widely practised
ritual treatment right across the Austronesian world. Two similar
reconstructions, POc <em>*puRuk</em> ‘to spray spittle etc. from the
mouth for magical purposes’ and POc <em>*puRas</em> ‘spray water from
the mouth’ are included in vol.5:362–3. Another practice that has been
reported in places as far part as Motu (<a
href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman 1910</a>:167), Bwaidoga (<a
href="../sources/JennessBallantyne1920">Jenness &amp; Ballantyne
1920</a>:139–141), Kove (<a href="../sources/Chowning1989">Chowning
1989</a>:224), Kwaio (<a href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing
1982</a>:118), Gela and Fiji (both <a

manipulation of a body part to isolate something believed to cause the
problem so that it may be seized or spat out. POc <em>*samo(s)</em>
‘stroke, massage’ may include this activity as part of its wider meaning

<p>Another ritual may be undertaken when a person becomes seriously
ill. The illness is thought due to the patient’s soul becoming separated
from his body, apparently due to sorcery. At such times a curer will
enter into induced sleep, thus permitting his own soul to travel to
locate the soul of the unconscious person and return it to the land of
the living. Specialised terms for such magical or induced sleep
include:</p>

<h3 id="powerful-substances">2.3. Powerful substances</h3>
<p>Many spells involve the use of particular substances relevant to the
desired effect. Items chosen are thought to mimic, by their properties,
the desired result. Love magic may include adorning oneself with the
leaves of a sweet-smelling shrub such as <em>Euodia</em> hortensis (PCP
<em>*usi</em>) to capture a woman’s affections (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:281, 336). The leaves and
bark of particular plants are important in calling on ancestor spirits,
while roots are chewed for magical purposes. Ginger (POc <em>*laqia</em>
‘ginger, <em>Zingiber</em> officinale) (vol.3:414) is considered a
powerful substance used for both magical and medicinal purposes. Chewing
ginger as part of a spell serves to make the words ‘hot’, that is, to
augment their potency (<a href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin
1970</a>b:180). It is also a common ingredient in the ritual treatment
of disease, generally by the agent spitting the masticated substance on
to the afflicted body part. Wild ginger (<em>Zingiber zerumbet</em>)
also known as red ginger, is associated with magic and sorcery in Marovo
and Maringe, and chewed by the magician in Tangga preparing for war (<a
href="../sources/Bell1935a">Bell 1935a</a>:261). It was also wrapped in
dried banana leaves and burnt in pots by Motu on their ocean-going
canoes to help them go fast and well while on hiri trading voyages (<a
href="../sources/Gwilliam1982">Gwilliam 1982</a>:52).</p>
<p>Other plants associated with magical practices include turmeric,
<em>Curcuma longa</em> (POc <em>*yaŋo</em>, vol.3:412), used at Morovo
and Kwara’ae, and various leaves including those of <em>Dracaena</em>
augustifolia used in Arosi and Sa’a (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:290) and <em>Cordyline
fruticosa</em> used in Buka (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood 1935</a>), Marovo (<a
href="../sources/Hviding2005">Hviding 2005</a>:118), To’aba’ita (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin 1970</a>a:106), Kwaio (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>:189) and Tikopia (<a
href="../sources/Firth1967">Firth 1967</a>:182). POc <em>*jiRi</em>
(vol.3:418) refers to both <em>Dracaena</em> augustifolia and
<em>Cordyline fruticosa</em> ). <a
href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fortune1963">1963</a>:114–5) lists <em>Cordyline</em>
terminalis, an alternative name for C. Fruticosa, as of ceremonial
importance over a wide area, from the Admiralty Islands, through Milne
Bay, New Britain, the Solomons, Vanuatu, Fiji and Polynesia. Skins of
areca nuts, <em>Areca catechu</em> (POc <em>*buaq</em>, vol.3:393) are
used in black magic in Sa’a and elsewhere (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:246).</p>
<p>Lime (POc <em>*qapu(R)</em> ‘lime, burnt coral or limestone’,
vol.2:64) is also used for both magical and medicinal purposes. <a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">1935</a>:477) mentions the many uses of
lime (<em>iav</em>) in Petats. Not only is it added to the mixtures used
for a number of medicinal and magical purposes, it is also efficacious
alone, e.g. rubbed on a man who has been struck by spirits, or a person
suffering from a sprain or broken bone. <a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens</a> (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">1927</a>:195) lists the ceremonial uses of
lime (<em>sahu</em>) in Sa’a as (1) in black magic; (2) to induce magic
sleep; (3) to restore those who were possessed; (4) in exorcism; (5) for
protection of the <em>malaohu</em> [separated for initiation] boys, and
of the fighting man against adverse ghosts; and (6) to protect houses
from ghostly attack. It may be rubbed or painted on the skin or item to
be protected.</p>
<p><a id="p-255"></a></p>
<p>In addition, some magical procedures require objects such as physical
relics of the dead. In Lukep an ancestral relic [<em>bar</em>] like bone
or hair is used to communicate with the spirit world (D’Jernes). A
sorcerer in Mekeo will keep with him the relics (bones, teeth, hair)
(<em>faŋa ofuŋa</em>, lit. ‘body dirt’) of his patrilineal ancestors,
with whom he is in constant communication through dreams, signs,
divination and his nightly invocation of them to assist him and watch
over the members of his lineage (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>a:57). <a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">1935</a>:474) describes small bundles
called <em>ēto</em> carried as a general protection by adults in Buka
which contain relics of a dead relative or of an enemy who has been
eaten. In Sa’a, relics of the dead [<em>maŋite</em>] including the
skull, hair, fingernail and bone, are kept in a relic case in the corner
of a dwelling house where offerings are made (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:178). The magical equipment
of a sorcerer may also include oddly shaped stones, pieces of bark or
shell, and dried reptile or insect parts (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>a:60, <a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:292), particularly if they
show some physical similarity to a body part on which magic is to be
performed. (See also <a href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman
1910</a>:178ff).</p>
<p><a id="s-2-4"></a></p>
<h3 id="offerings">2.4. Offerings</h3>
<p>Although offerings are generally made in atonement for perceived
transgressions, they sometimes accompany a request to the ancestors for
good fortune in a future endeavour, and are also made as a form of
thanksgiving following harvest or successful fishing. There is
considerable variation from place to place in the degree to which an
offering is developed into formal ritual. In Manus, where people
consider that the main role of ancestral ghosts is to maintain a moral
code by punishing offenders with illness or other misfortune, people pay
only to atone for sin, never to promote good fortune from the spirits or
to avoid any future misfortune. “Payment to wipe off sin is just;
payment to keep a ghost from malice, if it were done, would be simply
bribery or tribute” (<a href="../sources/Fortune1935">Fortune
1935</a>:54).</p>
<p>Although offerings to ancestors appear to be a widespread part of
ritual in the southeast Solomons and Polynesia, evidence for their
existence in western Oceanic communities is very limited. A rare western
Oceanic example comes from <a
href="../sources/Malinowski1935">Malinowski</a> (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1935">1935</a>:467). He notes that although
the Trobriand belief in spirits and the part they play was vague and
shadowy, the ancestral spirits were acknowledged during the breaking of
new ground in gardening. While the villagers offer a quantity of special
food, usually fish, to the garden magician as ceremonial payment, a
small portion is exposed to the ancestral spirits, sacrificially and
with an invocation.</p>
<p>Offerings form a significant part of magic ritual in the southeast
Solomons both to ensure good fortune and to atone for perceived
transgressions. Hogbin (1964:78) describes sacrifices made at Longgu,
the most important of which were those preceding dispatch of a fleet of
trading canoes, when pigs were offered. Pigs were also sacrificed after
an earthquake to prevent further destruction. <a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens</a> (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">1927</a>:179) describes offering in Sa’a
known as <em>uraʔiŋe</em> that were made to ghosts to ensure their
goodwill. Offerings of porpoise teeth were tied to the bows of war
canoes and on the bows and spears used in divination. They were also put
into the relic case found in each dwelling house that already contained
the skull or jawbone or tooth of the departed householder and to which
further contributions could be made in the event of illness. If desired,
a pig might also be burnt in sacrifice on behalf of the sick (p.180).
Sacrifice was also made at the launching of a new bonito canoe (p.250).
In Kwaio, pigs, known as <em>fōta</em> ‘offerings’ are consecrated to
ancestors before being sacrificed in atonement (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>:69).</p>

<h4 id="first-fruits">2.4.1. First fruits</h4>
<p>The giving of thanks for the harvest is widely noted as a way of
maintaining good relations with the ancestors, and ensuring their
support in future endeavours. That mention of first fruits is rare in
western Oceanic may be an accidental by-product of our ethnographic
sampling, or may be because first fruits are typically not accorded
significant ritual there. In Bwaidoga, at harvest, each man would simply
place one of his largest yams in the back of his hut to rot, in order to
pay the spirits (<a href="../sources/JennessBallantyne1920">Jenness
&amp; Ballantyne 1920</a>:126). In Kilivila where every stage of
gardening activity is preceded by ritual, the garden magician, prior to
the gathering of taro and kuvi (large yams), cuts off the top of a taro
plant in each holding and places it in his house rafters as an offering
to the ancestral spirit. In the third day following, each man pulls up a
few taro plants and digs a few yams. These ‘first fruits’ are brought to
the village where some are displayed and others placed on the graves of
recently dead relatives (<a href="../sources/Malinowski1935">Malinowski
1935</a>:166). In Madak, New Ireland, where each man carries out
elaborate ritual while cultivating his own taro garden, “a small first
fruits feast can be held to celebrate the garden” once the taros are
ready (<a href="../sources/Eves1998">Eves 1998</a>:210).</p>
<p>In the southeast Solomons, Fiji, Polynesia, Micronesia and parts of
Vanuatu, the offering of first fruits to the ancestors is typically
carried out by priests or village elders on behalf of the community
rather than by individuals, as is often the case in western Oceanic
communities. <a href="../sources/Codrington1891">Codrington</a> (<a
href="../sources/Codrington1891">1891</a>:132) notes that in Gela and
Sa’a, when canarium nuts were ripe, no-one might partake until sacrifice
of the first fruits. (In Gela the term for ‘first fruits’ is
<em>hinava</em>.) In Ulawa, people were free to dig their yams only
after the first fruits had been offered by the priest. This offering is
called <em>toli uhi</em> [lay/place yams] (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:363). Similarly in Kwaio,
when taro and yams were cultivated, a priest was required to make an
offering of first fruits from the garden to the ancestral owners, before
the living owner of the garden could partake of the food (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>:119–121). Separate
rituals were undertaken for each. Keesing’s Kwaio dictionary (1975)
lists <em>fafiʔalo</em> ‘the shrine, ritual complex etc. involving
presentation of first fruits of taro to the spirits’. To’aba’ita differs
in that it is the male owner of a new garden rather than the priest who
takes one small taro and roasts and eats it by himself: this opens the
garden, allowing it to be harvested by other family members. This is the
ceremony of <em>gwa lusu abu</em> ‘first fruit of taro’ (<a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk2008">Lichtenberk 2008</a>:172).
<em>lusu</em> is also the term for ‘first fruits’ in Lau.</p>
<p><a id="p-258"></a></p>
<p><a href="../sources/Durrad1940">Durrad</a> (<a
href="../sources/Durrad1940">1940</a>:398) describes the gardening
activities on Lo in the Torres Islands in northern Vanuatu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time for digging [the yams] is decided upon by the village
elders, and there is a certain amount of ceremonial associated with the
lifting of the first yam, which is offered as a sacrifice to the
ancestral gods. When this first yam has been lifted, and the ritual
connected therewith finished, everyone can lift his yams as he requires
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../sources/Petersen2009">Petersen</a> (<a
href="../sources/Petersen2009">2009</a>:196) describes the situation in
Micronesia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most extensive, conspicuous and consequential of all Micronesian
religious practices are the first fruits rituals. Although known by a
wide variety of names – for example, Lamotrek <em>maulmei</em> (Alkire
1974), Chuuk <em>wumwusomwoon</em> (Goodenough 2002:262–5), Marshalls’
<em>ekan</em> (Carucci 1997:168), Pohnpei <em>nohpwei</em>, and Kiribati
<em>inagu</em> (Lundsgaarde 1978:71) – they are nearly identical
throughout the region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although first fruits presentations and feasts may be directed
specifically towards the chiefs, ultimately they are a form of homage to
the spirits, a way of safeguarding the land from the force of storms and
drought. In Micronesia the first fruits rites are performed in stages
throughout the seasons for most staple food crops, this as a way of
being ever-mindful of the protection of the spirits (<a
href="../sources/Petersen2009">Petersen 2009</a>:196).</p>
<p>In Moala (Fiji) the yearly tribute of first fruits was given to the
chief “that the land might be prosperous” (<a
href="../sources/Sahlins1962">Sahlins 1962</a>:319). “In the old days
the presentation of first fruits (<em>sevu</em>) was of great magical
and religious as well as political significance” (p.343). The village
priest, bete, traditionally directed the collection of the yams before
they went to the chief. The latter was required to contribute his own
yams because the recipient was ultimately the god.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Williamson1937">Williamson</a> (<a
href="../sources/Williamson1937">1937</a>:121) reports that the periodic
offering of first fruits was widespread throughout Polynesia. In Futuna,
the main ritual season began with a major feast and with the offering of
the first yams to the gods (<a href="../sources/Kirch1994b">Kirch
1994b</a>:275). The Maori offered a portion of the first fruits of each
season – fish, fowl, and vegetable – to the departmental gods; of birds
to Tane, of fish and seaweed to Tangoroa, and cultivated foods to Rongo
(<a href="../sources/Best1934">Best 1934</a>:69).</p>

<h2 id="the-practitioners">3. The practitioners</h2>
<p>Anyone in a community would be able to call on their ancestors for
such matters as success in love or fishing. But communities generally
have recognised purveyors whose assistance may be bought for more
serious concerns. Spells are typically handed down from parent to child,
and spell owners who have a reputation for successful outcomes,
particularly in areas such as childbirth or control of the weather will
be much sought after.</p>
<p>A difficulty in dealing with the role of practitioners in magic lies
in the somewhat indiscriminate use in ethnographies and wordlists of the
terms ‘priest’ and ‘sorcerer’, and the related role of shaman. All may
have a claimed special ability to communicate with the gods. Although
sorcery is concerned with doing harm, some so-defined sorcerers have
powers that serve positive ends. <a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen</a> (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">1987</a>a:44) writes that in Mekeo “a
sorcerer may well spend far more of his time in healing than in doing
harm.” In contrast, those serving as priests in the southeast Solomons
and Polynesia do not deal in harmful magic. They fill a pre-determined
role in the community, often inherited, and have regular ritual duties
to undertake. Effectively, their duties are to maintain communication
with the ancestors and ensure their blessings. In return, they may be
accorded certain privileges. A shaman, sometimes referred to as a spirit
medium, usually fills a lesser role, underpinned by the ability to fall
into a trance, during which he may transmit answers from the spirits as
to certain queries, perhaps identifying the source of a wrong-doing. It
should be noted however that these roles are not clearcut. The ability
to perform while in a trance is also noted in people including the
sorcerers in Mekeo and those serving as priests in Fiji and Polynesia
(see Stephens 1987a, <a
href="../sources/WilliamsandCalvert1859">Williams &amp; Calvert 1859</a>
and <a href="../sources/Williamson1937">Williamson 1937</a> below).</p>
<p>In western Oceanic communities there is little evidence of a
specialised priestly role such as is found in the southeast Solomons and
Polynesia. Superior practice of magic appears to lie in western Oceanic
either with the headman or with specialist magicians like the garden
magician of Kilivila, who fills a role in the hierarchy second only to
the chief, with duties that also serve social and administrative ends
(<a href="../sources/Malinowski1935">Malinowski 1935</a>:66). In Wogeo,
for instance, the <em>kokwal</em> (hereditary clan headman) “has a far
more extensive knowledge of magic, including sorcery, than other people.
… Apart from the <em>kokwal</em> there is little or no specialisation.”
His area of expertise is with matters that concern the whole village,
such as weather magic and for success in trading (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1935a">Hogbin 1935a</a>:319). In Mekeo there are,
among practitioners of harmful magic of all kinds, departmental experts
who can summon stronger spirits than non-specialists and are in command
of more powerful medicines (<a href="../sources/Hauofa1981">Hau’ofa
1981</a>:240). In Dobu, although ownership of incantations is tightly
held by family lines, reputation may be built upon demonstrated skill in
a particular area (<a href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune
1963</a>:135). <a href="../sources/Chowning1973">Chowning</a> (<a
href="../sources/Chowning1973">1973</a>:65) writes that “it is true that
Melanesia generally lacks full-time specialists of any sort. On the
other hand, part-time priests, often the heads of kin groups, who make
sacrifices to ancestral ghosts are not uncommon in eastern Melanesia.”
Presumably she is here including the southeast Solomons.</p>
<p><a id="p-260"></a></p>
<p>In the southeast Solomons are communities which include within their
descent groups a person who officiates at the offering of sacrifices to
the gods. Wordlists typically gloss the native term for such people as
‘priests’. In northern Malaita they are referred to as <em>fata-abu</em>
(‘speak sacred’) (<a href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>:11).
In Kwaio each descent group has a ‘shrine-man’ (<em>wane naa baʔe</em>)
[<em>baʔe</em> ‘shrine’], ideally agnatically descended from the
founding ancestors, who, although not a full-time religious specialist,
acts as the principal officiant in sacrifices to ancestors (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>:19, 87–91). <a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">1970</a>a:106) writes that in To’aba’ita
“each cemetery has its own priest [<em>aofia</em>] who has to give his
approval before any offering can be made to the spirits of the persons
buried there. The office is held by hereditary right, being transmitted
from father to son, but it is by no means a full-time job, and apart
from his special position at ceremonies the priest lives the life of an
ordinary man.” Lau also has <em>aofia</em> whose duties are to officiate
at sacrifices (<a href="../sources/Fox1974">Fox 1974</a>). In Sa’a, the
priest (<em>ora-ora</em>) officiates at the sacrifice of burnt offerings
made to ancestors, and shares some of the privileges due also to the
priest, such as being exempt from the obligation to make a return for
gifts received. As in To’aba’ita and Kwaio, the position is hereditary
(<a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:8, 242).</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Codrington1891">Codrington</a> (<a
href="../sources/Codrington1891">1891</a>:127) writes of Vanuatu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no priestly order, and no persons who can properly be called
priests…. If the object of worship … is one common to the members of a
community, the man who knows how to approach that object is in a way
their priest and sacrifices or them all; but it is in respect of that
particular function only that he has a sacred character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there is little information on the practice of magic in
Micronesia, <a href="../sources/Linton1926">Linton</a> (<a
href="../sources/Linton1926">1926</a>:175, 176) notes that “in all the
groups there were individuals who combined the duties of priest and
shaman, serving the gods, curing the sick and working magic. …
Throughout Micronesia offerings were made and rites performed at
uncarved stones believed to be the dwelling places of spirits.”</p>
<p>Fijians had <em>bete</em>, men with special powers for communicating
with the gods. Williams (<a
href="../sources/WilliamsandCalvert1859">Williams &amp; Calvert
1859</a>:178) writes that they “exercise a powerful influence over the
people, an influence which the Chiefs employ for the strengthening of
their own, by securing the divine sanction for their plans.” The
priesthood was generally, but not invariably, hereditary, a vital part
of a bete’s role being the ability to communicate the wishes of the god
he serves while in a trance. As Williams puts it (p178), he needed to
“shake well and speculate shrewdly.”</p>
<p><a href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">Kirch &amp; Green</a> (<a
href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">2001</a>:249) write that “the
evidence is compelling that in ancestral Polynesian societies the
principal ritual leaders were simultaneously the main secular leaders,
the <em>*qariki</em>.” However, a separate functional class of priests
indicated by PPn <em>*taaula</em>, developed largely in hierarchically
elaborated societies like those of Tonga, Samoa and Hawaii.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Williamson1937">Williamson</a> (<a
href="../sources/Williamson1937">1937</a>:288) describes the religious
function of the <em>taaula</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>as being personally to organize and reinforce the religious beliefs
and sentiments of the people. They were the holders of the ancient
traditions, who were well versed in the impressive legends of the gods
and creation. Ritual too was their province, and they directed
ceremonial behavior along lines pleasing to the gods and spectacular to
the worshippers, common participation in which served to keep alive
religious sentiments. When inspired by the gods they manifested abnormal
or unusual forms of behavior which provided visible evidence of their
close communion with supernatural forces. … By making sacrifices and
directing ritual they pleased the gods, and made them favourably
inclined towards their worshippers; by prayer and intercession they
sought for blessings or the aversion of evil.</p>

<p>In practice, most magic is performed by men, since nearly all the
tasks for which it is appropriate are those normally done by men. Women
priests were not unknown in Polynesia. However, the magical procedures
of protection and healing are often more highly individualised than
those of production, and across the Oceanic world these may often be
performed by women.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="role-of-trance">3.1. Role of trance</h3>
<p>The ability of some people to fall into a trance-like state as a
means of accessing the spirit world is reported from many communities.
Ethnographers may refer to such practitioners as shamans or spirit
mediums. They may enter a state of disassociation or semi-
consciousness, usually ritually induced, as a form of self-hypnosis,
perhaps preceded by prolonged fasting. In this condition they are
recognised as possessed by the god, and believed capable of super-human
powers. A person’s utterance is then thought to be the direct voice of
the ancestor or god.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Elsewhere, the role of shaman varies
greatly.</p>
<p><a id="p-262"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes a medical condition expressed by semi-consciousness or
other abnormal behaviour will be interpreted as due to the possession by
spirits.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Fortune1935">Fortune</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fortune1935">1935</a>:9) summarises belief in Manus.
“The Manus have the familiar concept of … a certain kind of soul or
vital essence in the living, … the concept that in trance or swoon this
soul or essence approaches the ghosts.”</p>
<p>In Mekeo, it is the sorcerer himself who, like a shaman in some
respects, communicates with the spirits in visions, trance and dreams,
although he avoids the more overt displays of spirit possession often
associated with the latter (<a href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen
1987</a>a:66–67).</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing</a> (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">1982</a>:108) writes that although in
Kwaio there is no culturally defined role for a person with shamanistic
powers, “the rare man with such psychic bent … is attributed special
sacredness in life.”</p>
<p>Across Micronesia there are spirit mediums – individuals through whom
the spirit of the dead are able to speak to the living, while the living
are, in turn, able to petition ancestral spirits for information and
assistance (<a href="../sources/Petersen2009">Petersen
2009</a>:195).</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Sahlins1962">Sahlins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Sahlins1962">1962</a>:359) describes those he calls
well-rounded shamans (dau ðaka wai) in Moala Fijian “who not only cure,
sorcerize and counter-sorcerize, but also find lost things and foretell
events.”</p>
<p>In Fijian and parts of Polynesia, certain people identified by their
ability to enter trance-like states are known by terms reflecting Proto
Central Pacific <em>*waga</em> (or PNPn <em>*waka-qatua</em>):</p>

<p>One role commonly employed by shamans is that of identifying the
person or spirit responsible for perceived harm. Some do it by
divination, testing hypotheses by way of yes/ no questions, but there is
little commonality in the methods recorded. <a
href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fortune1963">1963</a>:154) describes ways of divining
in Dobu by water-gazing or crystal gazing, <a

href="../sources/Wedgwood193435">1934-35</a>:293) describes various ways

href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen</a> (<a

another means for a Mekeo sorcerer to communicate directly with the
spirits. Hogbin describes a kind of diviner in Longgu, the
<em>toʔiai</em>, who possesses spells that enable him to conjure the
dead man’s soul into an areca nut. By means of various yes/no questions
and the resulting movement of the areca nut the guilty party is located
(1964:58). In Kwaio, dried cordyline leaves called <em>felo</em> are
commonly used in divination (<a href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing
1982</a>:113). In Sa’a, various implements including bows, spears and
bonito rods may be utilised (<a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens
1927</a>:345). <a href="../sources/Tonkinson1981">Tonkinson</a> (<a

Ambrym known as <em>lele</em> who claim the ability to discern by
divination whether or not particular illnesses are sorcery-related.
Williams (1858:228) describes various methods of divination used in Fiji
to decide between two options.</p>
<p><a id="p-263"></a></p>
<p>Although the belief that certain people have the ability to intercede
with the gods while in a trance or other inexplicable state appears to
be widespread, as is the practice of divination, no reconstructions
other than the above have been possible. Wordlists rarely include terms
such as ‘shaman’ or ‘spirit medium’ or ‘trance’ or ‘divination’.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-2"></a></p>
<h3 id="preparation-for-magic">3.2. Preparation for magic</h3>
<p>There is widespread belief that magic will be strengthened or made
effective if the protagonist undergoes certain privations before he can
carry out his activities. Similar privations must be undertaken by
anyone about to sacrifice to the gods. As summarised by <a
href="../sources/Eves1998">Eves</a> (<a
href="../sources/Eves1998">1998</a>:58) in Madak, “all of the powerful
forms of magic, and some minor forms, require the magician to undergo a
regime of fasting and sexual abstinence.” To illustrate, we offer
examples from three Western Oceanic subgroups, NNG (Wogeo); PT (Mekeo,
Roro); and MM (Tabar, Petats).</p>
<p>In Wogeo, most men think it advisable to refrain from sexual
intercourse and from eating nuts for a full twenty-four hours if they
are expecting to perform gardening or fishing magic (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin 1970</a>b:181).</p>
<p>An extreme form of preparation is practised by a sorcerer in Mekeo,
who must be in a constant state of ritual preparedness. <a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen</a> (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">1987</a>:62) points out that the
inflicting of serious illness, injury and death differs from other magic
only in that the sorcerer deals with more dangerous entities … and he
must prepare himself more stringently for the task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sexual abstinence is the most important restriction and this may be
necessary for only a few days, several weeks or many months. It is also
essential not to immerse the body in cold water, wash in it or drink it.
Hot water must be used for washing; and in the most rigorous forms of
<em>gope</em> [the magical act] no washing at all is permitted. Only hot
liquids may be drunk; and under rigorous <em>gope</em> one drinks as
little as possible. … What little food is consumed must be taken with
plenty of ginger or chilli to make it hot. This regime is said to render
the adept’s body light and hot and dry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman</a> (<a
href="../sources/Seligman1910">1910</a>:292) describes preparation for a
wallaby hunt in Roro where “not only is co-habitation forbidden to the
expert, but he may not eat food cooked by his wife or any other woman,
he may not eat yams, nor the flesh of wallaby, nor pig, though he may
eat the flesh of the kangaroo-rat and drink the milk of unripe coconuts
which have been more or less roasted.”.</p>
<p>In Tabar, a fishing net magician neither eats nor drinks during three
days of rites before initial use (<a
href="../sources/Groves1934a">Groves 1934a</a>:449). In Petats, when
bonito magic rites are performed, the principal performer must neither
eat nor sleep until the rites are over, and along with all who take part
in the bonito fishing, must abstain from sexual intercourse. (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood 1935</a>:480).</p>
<p><a id="p-264"></a></p>
<p>No examples have been located from Eastern Oceanic subgroups.</p>
<p><a id="s-4"></a></p>
<h2 id="sorcery">4. Sorcery</h2>
<p>Sorcery here refers to magic used for harmful purposes. In its most
extreme form, sometimes referred to as black magic, it was used to cause
a person’s death. Such knowledge was almost never admitted to. It was
the most secret of possessions. As dangerous knowledge, it was essential
that it be kept within the hands of a chosen few. It was strongly
discouraged by missionaries as incompatible with Christian beliefs. In
British New Guinea from the 1880’s on, there was also a very real fear
of the results of government interference, for sorcery became an
indictable offence (<a href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman
1910</a>:278). It would seem that in general it is desirable that those
who profess knowledge of sorcery do not draw attention to their powers,
lest it leave them open to retaliation. Sorcery works best in a climate
of rumour and innuendo. Occasionally, however, as described by Seligman
in Roro (1910:279), “a sorcerer may … be regarded generally as real
protection, for, besides being able to thwart the acts of sorcerers of
other villages, the latter will, it is supposed, refrain from hostile
magic in order not to provoke reprisals”, while Hogbin (1964:57) noted
that the Longgu of Guadalcanal attributed a knowledge of sorcery to most
village headmen and many elders, “to the extent that man’s
identification as a sorcerer was a measure of his social
distinction.”</p>
<p>Sorcerers may be the most powerful people in a community, their
activities serving purposes for both good and ill. Their legitimate role
may lie in regulating social life, a form of coersive social control. <a
href="../sources/Hogbin1935b">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1935b">1935b</a>:18) writes that in Wogeo,
<em>yabou</em> (black magic) helps to ensure that individual rights are
respected and obligations carried out, and that the chief men are
obeyed. Disadvantages lie in that it occasionally leads to murders and
tends to increase local hostilities. <a
href="../sources/Firth1967">Firth</a> (<a
href="../sources/Firth1967">1967</a>:211) defines the reasons for
sorcery from the perspective of Tikopia as “mainly those of economics or
of personal status: desire for land; wish to punish for theft of food;
jealousy of competitive achievement; resentment at a personal
affront.”</p>
<p>Although there is widespread belief across communities (e.g. Roro
[Seligman 1910:279], Mekeo [Stephen 1987b:252], Kove [Chowning
1987:157], Longgu [Hogbin 1964:58]) that except in the case of infants
and very old folk and those killed in warfare, death is the result of
sorcery, much of sorcery consists of attack and counter-attack, without
resulting in death. Kin of sick individuals may approach those believed
to have the power to cause harm and offer them payment to remove their
spell (<a href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>:43). A sufferer
may have a good idea of someone he or his close kin have offended, or
know of those who hold a grudge against him, and he may have a good idea
of those with the ability to practise sorcery and identify the likely
sorcerer. Chowning notes (1989:224) that in Kove, if an illness was
drawn out, it was assumed that the sorcerer wanted to be bought off
rather than to kill the victim. There it was common practice to approach
a number of known sorcerers with offerings of shell money and to ask
them to undo the spell.</p>
<p>Much sorcery was carried out for personal or private reasons. In
Dobu, it was used “for collecting bad debts and enforcing social
obligation, in vendetta to avenge one’s own sickness or one kinsman’s
death, to wipe out any serious insult” (<a
href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune 1963</a>:175). Chowning writes
that in Kove sorcery threats were used to enforce many prohibitions,
such as those that prevented a woman from showing disrespect for the
rituals of the men’s houses, and they also made the younger men obey
their elders. Chowning considers that it was threats of sorcery rather
than powerful spirits or gods that upheld general moral standards in
Kove (1989:225).</p>
<p><a id="p-265"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, as in the Trobriands (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1922">Malinowski 1922</a>:75), Mekeo (<a
href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>b:270) and Kaoka/Longgu
(Hogbin 1964), a sorcerer will reserve the right to heal by
counteracting sorcery imposed by another, although more often this is
done by specialist healers. He may also be prevailed upon to remove his
own spell by means of payment by kin of the affected person.</p>
<p>While lesser illness may have been attributed to attack by spirits or
to the breaking of a taboo, severe illness was more likely to be
considered due to sorcery involving theft of the victim’s soul. As
Stephen describes it, the soul journeys of the Mekeo sorcerer are the
means of not only ensnaring the souls of others but also of restoring
them (p.270).</p>
<p>As might be expected, no POc terms are reconstructable. A term for
‘sorcery’ and related ‘sorcerer’ is reconstructable for PPT.</p>

<p>However, a search through available sources throws up the terms
listed below. They all bear some resemblance to PPT <em>*baravu</em>
above. Assuming regular sound correspondences, the PPT reconstruction
suggests a POc †<em>*ba(r,R)apu</em>, but none of the forms below
exactly reflects this. Lou <em>pʷalop</em> comes close, but Lou
<em>-l-</em> reflects POc <em>*-l-</em>, not POc <em>*-r-</em> or
<em>*-R-</em> (<a href="../sources/Blust1998b">Blust 1998b</a>).
Intriguingly, the PT language Kilivila has apparently replaced this same
consonant with <em>-g-</em>. Similar issues affect the cognacy of the
other items below, yet the likelihood of chance resemblances of several
trisyllables with similar senses is close to zero. A plausible inference
is that the word itself was considered to have evil power and was
distorted for that reason.</p>

<h3 id="sorcery-using-leavings">4.1. Sorcery using leavings</h3>
<p>Examples from NNG, PT, MM and SES show consistency of belief
regarding the methods used by those wishing to inflict harm on another
through use of leavings.</p>
<p>In Manam, “when a man wishes to work <em>dzere</em> against an enemy,
he takes something which has been in close contact with the latter – it
may be a piece of chewed areca nut, some lime, a piece of clothing or
some hair clippings” (<a href="../sources/Wedgwood193435">Wedgwood
1934-35</a>:71). In Dobu, “personal leavings may be remains of food,
excreta, footprints in sand, body dirt, or a bush creeper with a
malevolent charm first breathed into it which the sorcerer watched his
victim brush against and which he subsequently took to his house to
treat further” (<a href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune 1963</a>:150).
<a href="../sources/Eves1998">Eves</a> (<a
href="../sources/Eves1998">1998</a>:63) writes that in Madak “personal
leavings sorcery involves the sorcerer manipulating the victim’s
personal exuviae (excreta, hair, fingernails etc.) or items which the
victim has used or touched (such as a discarded areca nut shell or the
soil from a footprint).”</p>
<p>In Sa’a,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the things used for magical charms to work harm with were skins of
areca nuts which a person had eaten, cutting of hair or nails,
excrement, spittle, earth on which the intended victim had trodden, the
strip of coconut leaf with which he had rubbed himself down after
bathing, fragments of his food, the afterbirth of children. In most
cases the object was breathed upon in order to impart virtue to it.
Certain things were considered as possessing in themselves the power to
do harm, and an incantation was said over such charms. Lime, ginger and
dracaena leaves were the most commonly used of these. (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:324)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our efforts to identify the kind of magic practices performed in POc
times are based on descriptions from ethnographies. These show
considerable resemblances, but the terminology of magic is more diverse,
making reliable reconstruction difficult. Where communities carry out
comparable rituals they do so either because they are continuing the
practice of their forebears, or because the practices are borrowed or
because they have been independently innovated. Borrowings in matters
magical could be presumed minimal in view of the secrecy surrounding
them in practice, at least prior to western contact. But when such
beliefs as that in which a curer could travel in dreams to recover the
soul of an ill person are identified across subgroups, and are unrelated
to any comparable Christian belief, then evidence favours the conclusion
that this was the practice of their forebears.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over time and place, the very belief system can undergo
reinterpretation, with communities modifying beliefs in such things as
the role of the ancestors and the purpose of traditional rituals. As an
example of the former, <a href="../sources/Hogbin1935a">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1935a">1935a</a>:330) writes that in Wogeo the
people believed that the ancestors were barely involved there in daily
life. “The spirits of the dead are able to cause the death of small
infants, but otherwise they are completely powerless. It follows from
this that as reciprocity is the keynote of native life, sacrifices are
held to be entirely superfluous and are never in fact carried out.” As
an example of the latter we can look to the tendency in places for
offerings to be seen no longer as primarily to the ancestors, but rather
to the aggrandisement of the occasion, as in Mekeo (<a
href="../sources/Hauofa1981">Hau’ofa 1981</a>:71) or to the giver, as in
To’aba’ita (<a href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin 1970</a>a:105). But
when offerings are made to the magician or priest, apparently as thanks
for their intervention, we still find that as in the Trobriands (<a
href="../contributions/6-8#s-8-2-4">§8.2.4</a>), in Micronesia and in
Moala Fiji (<a href="../contributions/6-8#s-8-2-4">§8.2.4</a>.1), some
part is set aside as a form of homage to the ancestors.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the practice of magic has many similarities across the
Oceanic world. The following apply consistently across subgroups and are
thought likely to accord with the practice of POc society.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic was effected by invoking the ancestors/gods or spirits through
spells consisting of learned words and actions.</li>
<li>Spells were believed to originate with ancestors and were passed
down with care.</li>
<li>Certain materials including ginger, lime, and leaves of various
plants were accorded special powers in the performance of magic
ritual.</li>
<li>The efficacy of the magic was dependent on accurate performance of
the ritual.</li>
<li>Offerings typically in the form of garden produce or fish were made
to the ancestors/gods both as a form of obeisance at propitious times
including before important events, and as atonement for perceived
offences.</li>
<li>Offerings of first fruits were made to the ancestors at harvest time
before people could partake.</li>
<li>There were no people who specialised in serving the gods in POc
times. People with recognised expertise in particular fields could be
called on as required.</li>
<li>Misfortune and death were, with some exceptions, believed to be the
result of human activity resulting in ancestral displeasure.</li>
<li>Severe illness was thought due to theft of the sufferer’s soul by
sorcery.</li>
<li>Sorcerers were able to make decisions of life or death over
perceived offenders.</li>
<li>Personal leavings such as hair, fingernail clippings, or items used
or touched by intended victim were dangerous weapons in the hands of
people wishing to do someone harm.</li>

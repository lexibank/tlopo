<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Around 3000 BP bearers of Lapita became the first people to move
beyond the intervisible islands of western Melanesia and settle Santa
Cruz and the Reef Islands in the eastern Solomons and the archipelagos
of Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. By 2800 BP there were Lapita
settlements in Tonga and Samoa, 4500 km east of the Bismarcks.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Lapita dispersal across the southwest Pacific was astonishing in
its speed and scale. Founding populations were established almost
simultaneously in several previously uninhabited island groups. This
must have involved the organising of many long-distance voyages carrying
considerable numbers of people, including the building of ocean-going
outrigger canoes, the recruitment of crews and passengers, and the
transport of useful plants and breeding stocks of domestic animals.</p>
<p>The question arises as to what forms of leadership underpinned these
achievements and whether historical linguistics in combination with the
ethnographic record can provide clues, in the form of relevant lexical
reconstructions. The following discussion will draw on a number of
earlier studies which have addressed these questions, including <a
href="../sources/Green1994a">Green</a> (<a
href="../sources/Green1994a">1994a</a>, <a
href="../sources/Green2002">2002</a>), <a

href="../sources/Pawley1982a">Pawley</a> (<a
href="../sources/Pawley1982a">1982a</a>).</p>
<p>The Polynesian material is surveyed first because it yields a number
of well supported Proto Polynesian terms to do with rank and leadership,
indicating that Proto Polynesian society had hereditary chiefs in a
system of ranked descent groups, with rank based on seniority of
descent. We then turn to other Oceanic-speaking societies. Although the
evidence there is less straightforward I will argue that Proto Oceanic
society had a system of rank and leadership essentially similar to that
reconstructed for Proto Polynesian. I will not discuss evidence for
reconstructing terms for rank and leadership in Austronesian interstages
earlier than Proto Oceanic. <a href="../sources/Blust1995b">Blust</a>
(<a href="../sources/Blust1995b">1995b</a>:500) observes that relevant
reconstructions for Proto Malayo-Polynesian are few and semantically
ambiguous. <a href="../sources/Bellwood1996">Bellwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Bellwood1996">1996</a>) speculates on the role of
hierarchy in the Austronesian dispersal.</p>

Reconstructing terms for rank and leadership in Proto Polynesian
society</h2>
<p>The archaeologists <a href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">Kirch and
Green</a> (<a href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">2001</a>) draw on
linguistic, archaeological and ethnographic evidence to reconstruct
elements of ‘ancestral Polynesian society’. They equate ancestral
Polynesian society with the communities that spoke PPn. This equation
may seem a straightforward matter but there are problems in determining
precisely where and when PPn was spoken. Bearers of the Lapita culture
settled Tongatapu, in the south of the Tongan archipelago, at about 2850
BP (<a href="../sources/Burleyetal2011">Burley et al. 2011</a>). Within
a century or so Lapita settlements were established on the islands of
western Polynesia to the north of the Tongan group, on Samoa,
Niuatoputapu and ’Uvea and probably Futuna.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The
divergence between Tongic and Nuclear Polynesian presumably followed
these settlements.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Tongic and Nuclear Pn remained part of a
dialect complex and that innovations continued to spread across western
Polynesia for many centuries after the initial colonisation. The
innovations defining the Polynesian subgroup are so numerous that they
indicate a millennium or more of unified development after it diverged
from all other Oceanic languages. If so, some elements of the
reconstructed PPn language must date to a period before distinct Tongic
and Nuclear Pn dialects developed, and others date to a later time. I
will refer to the former as ‘early PPn’ and the latter as ‘late PPn’.
Late PPn society, being spread over several widely separated island
groups in the Tonga-Samoa area, would have shown some regional
variation.</p>
<p><a id="s-2-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="proto-polynesian-qariki-chief">2.1. Proto Polynesian
<em>*qariki</em> ‘chief’</h3>
<p>The linguistic evidence for attributing hereditary chieftainship to
PPn society is compelling. Almost every Polynesian language has a reflex
of PPn <em>*qariki</em>, which can be roughly glossed ‘chief, person of
chiefly rank’ and in most Polynesian societies chiefly rank is
determined by seniority of birth. A number of derived forms based on
<em>*qariki</em> are also attributable to PPn.</p>
<p>Initial <em>*q</em>, representing a glottal stop /ʔ/, is
reconstructed in PPn <em>*qariki</em> because it is retained in the
Tongan, Uvean and Rennellese reflexes. PPn <em>*r</em> is reconstructed
rather than <em>*l</em> because <em>*r</em> is regularly lost in the two
Tongic languages, while they retain PPn <em>*l</em> as <em>l</em>. PPn
<em>*r</em> and <em>*l</em> merged as <em>*l</em> in Proto Nuclear Pn.
The fact that reflexes of <em>*qariki</em> in Tongic and Nuclear Pn have
undergone the sound changes characteristic of each subgroup, yielding
Proto Tongic <em>*ʔeiki</em> and Proto Nuclear Pn <em>*ʔaliki</em>,
indicates that the reflexes are inherited from an early stage of PPn,
i.e. before Tongic and Nuclear Pn diverged, rather than being later
diffusions across the dialect boundary between Tongic and Nuclear
Pn.</p>

<p>The PPn term <em>*qariki</em> evidently served both as a noun ‘chief’
and as head of a derived stative verb <em>*qariki-tia</em> ‘be occupied

of the type described by <a href="../sources/Pawley2001">Pawley</a> (<a

PMP <em>*datu</em>, Samoan <em>lātū</em>, Fijian <em>rātū</em>: an
accidental resemblance?</h4>
<p>Many Malayo-Polynesian languages of the Philippines, Indonesia and
Malaysia reflect a PMP form <em>*datu</em>. Its reflexes have widely
varying glosses, including ‘chief’, ‘headman’, ‘leader’, ‘lineage
priest’, ‘head of family, ‘grandparent’, ‘prince’, ‘king’, ‘title given
to a sovereign’, ‘term of respect to any man of standing’, ‘shaman’,
‘ancestor in the female line’ (ACD). It is tempting to see a connection
to Samoan <em>lātū</em> ‘person in charge of an undertaking’ (<a
href="../sources/Milner1966">Milner 1966</a>); ‘head builder’ (<a
href="../sources/Pratt1911">Pratt 1911</a>) and to Fijian <em>rātū</em>
‘honorific particle and title of rank before names of males’ (<a
href="../sources/Capell1941">Capell 1941</a>). However, the resemblance
may be accidental. No possible cognates have been reported from any
non-Central Pacific Oceanic language. The Central Pacific forms have two
long vowels, which suggests that they originally consisted of two
morphemes. Furthermore, Geraghty (pers. comm.) advises that the use of
Fijian <em>rātū</em> as an honorific before names of men of rank is an
innovation of the colonial era. Its older use was as a prefix to a
chiefly title in certain regions of Fiji.</p>

<em>*fatu kāiŋa</em> which they tentatively gloss ‘leader of the
<em>kāiŋa</em>’ [a land-holding residential group, local kin group].
They acknowledge that reflexes of <em>*fatu</em> have a diverse range of
meanings in daughter languages, which makes semantic reconstruction
uncertain. The range includes: (1) ‘head of family’, (2) low-ranked
chief’, (3) ‘master, owner of an estate or resources’, (4) ‘person of
mature age, elder’. Reflexes of the compound <em>*fatu kāiŋa</em>
sometimes mean ‘senior person or carer in a family, one who oversees use
of resources such as food’, sometimes ‘land owner’ or ‘overseer’ and in
one case, ‘be a married person’.</p>

<em>tui</em>). However, it is not reflected in Eastern Polynesian or
Outlier languages and it is likely that it spread relatively recently,

<p>A cognate term occurs widely in Polynesian with a range of meanings.
The most extensive discussion of the semantic history of this term is <a
href="../sources/Marck2010">Marck</a> (<a
href="../sources/Marck2010">2010</a>). In Tikopia and Anuta it refers to
a non-exogamous patrilineal descent group consisting of several
exogamous lineages, and in Pukapukan it denotes a matrilineal
sublineage. This close formal and semantic agreement with the
Micronesian cognates supports attributing <em>*kainaŋa</em> ‘unilineal
descent group’ both to PPn and to the stage of Oceanic ancestral to PPn
and Micronesian.</p>
<p>However, in several Polynesian languages (Tongan, E Uvean,
Rennellese, Hawaiian, Marquesan and Manihiki) the reflex of
<em>*kainaŋa</em> refers not to a unilineal descent group but rather to
the subjects of a chief, the common people. <a
href="../sources/Marck2010">Marck</a> (<a
href="../sources/Marck2010">2010</a>:617) argues that PPn developed over
a long period of time across the islands of western Polynesia and that
PPn society and language showed regional variation. He attributes the
sense ‘clan, unilineal descent group’ to an early stage of PPn. This was
retained in a few Nuclear Pn daughter languages, but in some PPn
communities unilineal descent groups were replaced by cognatic descent
groups, in which membership could be claimed through either a male or
female ancestor, and <em>*kainaŋa</em> was used to refer to these
groups. In late PPn times <em>*kainaŋa</em> came to have an additional
sense, as a collective term for the populace, the common people of a
place, headed by a chief.</p>

<h4 id="commoners">2.2.7. Commoners</h4>
<p>Most Polynesian languages have a term or terms for a commoner, a
person who is not of chiefly lineage. The literal meanings of such terms
fall into three main classes: (1) derogatory terms, e.g. ‘worthless
person’ or ‘person of low degree’, (2) those that refer to ordinary
people, the populace, people of the land, (3) those that refer to a
person of a junior lineage. Although on distributional grounds it seems
likely that PPn had one or more terms denoting a person of low rank, no
well-supported PPn reconstructions can be made from these comparisons.
The partial agreement between Tongan <em>kai fonua</em>, E Uvean <em>kai
fenua</em>, and Samoan <em>tū-fanua</em> and <em>tau-fanua</em> points
to a PPn compound <em>*N</em> + <em>fanua</em> referring to commoners,
where <em>N</em> is a noun denoting person or people.</p>

<p>Various types of political systems were found in Polynesia at first
European contact. There is an extensive anthropological literature on
the evolution of these types. Most such works before about 1980 rely on
a comparative typological method, based on the geographic distribution
and frequency of types and the logic of transformations between types.
Important studies relying chiefly on comparative typology include <a

<p>Most of the above-mentioned works take little account of the
comparative method used in historical linguistics to reconstruct the
sound system and lexicon of the common ancestor of a family of related
languages and to construct a family tree (or subgrouping) for the
family. However, in recent decades a number of studies have drawn on
evidence from historical linguistics to support hypotheses about the
history of Polynesian political systems. Among these are monographs by

<p><a href="../sources/Goldman1970">Goldman</a> (<a
href="../sources/Goldman1970">1970</a>), a 600-page work comparing 18
Polynesian societies, distinguishes three main types of political
systems in Polynesia which he calls ‘traditional’, ‘open’ and
‘stratified’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the traditional type, status dominates, based on seniority of
descent and the sanctity of chiefs. Descent groups are headed by the
first-born male and are in turn ranked by seniority of birth (the
‘conical clan’ system). However, chiefs have quite limited political
authority over their descent group. Effective polities are small.</li>
<li>In open systems political power is dominant. In succession to
chiefly titles, seniority of birth is secondary to military and
political effectiveness.</li>
<li>In stratified societies inherited status and political power are
both more consequential than in traditional systems. High ranking people
hold political power and possess the land titles. Commoners are landless
subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="s-3-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="societies-with-traditional-political-systems">3.1. Societies
with ‘traditional’ political systems</h3>
<p>In Goldman’s sample the traditional type of political system is
represented by Tikopia, New Zealand Maori, Futuna, Uvea, Tongareva,
Manihiki-Rakahanga and Pukapuka. Notes on Tikopia and New Zealand Maori
follow.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-1-1"></a></p>
<h4 id="tikopia">3.1.1. Tikopia</h4>
<p>Tikopia is a small high island (4.6 km2) with very limited arable
land. Its population of around 1250 at first European contact tested to
the limit the carrying capacity of the environment. Nevertheless, as
described by <a href="../sources/Firth1936">Firth</a> (<a
href="../sources/Firth1936">1936</a>), it exemplifies perfectly the
essential characteristics of conical clan societies. Tikopia’s
population was divided into four ramified patrilineal descent groups or
clans (<em>kainaŋa</em>), each headed by a senior chief. The four clans
themselves were ranked from senior to junior. Clans divide into
<em>paito</em> ‘ramages’ (lit. ‘houses’) consisting of related families
tracing descent from a common ancestor a few generations back. There are
chiefly families (<em>paito ariki</em>) and commoner families (<em>paito
fakaarofa</em>). These are ranked according to traditional ritual
privileges and obligations associated with the beliefs in the gods.
Commoner families divide into families that have a ritual leader as head
(<em>paito pure</em>) and families that have no significant ritual
privileges. <a href="../sources/Firth1936">Firth</a> (<a
href="../sources/Firth1936">1936</a>:313) observes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>differences in the ordinary social position of chiefly and commoner
families are not great. They all own lands, they mingle freely,
exchanges take place between them on a basis of general reciprocity,
there is no “chief’s language”, as in Samoa or Java, kinship terms are
used between them, and nowadays intermarriage takes place freely between
their members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deep genealogies were kept by chiefly lineages. As the genealogically
senior man in a descent group, a chief had sacred powers deriving from
his <em>mana</em> (mystical power to make things happen) and
responsibilities to his people. He communed with the gods on behalf of
his kin, for example, to ensure economic prosperity. The chief had the
ability to control a ritual circulation of goods. He is the initiator of
the grand cycle and is responsible for keeping in motion the
distribution and redistribution of food. He was the giver of feasts on
his own account and the sponsor of all <em>kainaŋa</em>-wide and
island-wide rituals, which also involve energetic consumption. All who
gave to him were honoured by being literally drawn into the lines of
connection that run between chiefs and gods. For the most part, the
chief’s bounty was directly in the interests of his community, for
ritual, and for public works.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-1-2"></a></p>
<h4 id="new-zealand-maori">3.1.2. New Zealand Maori</h4>
<p>Despite great differences in geographic context, Maori and Tikopia
societies resemble each other quite closely in their systems of rank and
leadership. Maori tribes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>are classic examples of aristocratic organisations in which the basic
principles of primogeniture, seniority of descent, graded rank, sanctity
of chiefs, and the sanctity of the male line are well established but
which show none of the specialised features – achieved chiefly position,
sharp social stratification, and political centralisation – of the Open
and Stratified societies (<a href="../sources/Goldman1970">Goldman
1970</a>:30).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-161"></a></p>
<p>Chiefly status was hereditary. Descent groups were ranked by
seniority of birth of the founding ancestor. The first-born son of the
senior clan outranked lesser chiefs, who came from junior lines. Deep
genealogies were kept by chiefly lineages. As the genealogically most
senior man in a descent group a chief had sacred powers deriving from
his <em>mana</em> and responsibilities to his people. However, a lesser
chief from a junior line could extend political power beyond his own
clan and add to his <em>mana</em> by demonstrating leadership in secular
domains, such as warfare, diplomacy and organisation, which gave him
prestige beyond his own lineage.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-2"></a></p>
<h3 id="stratified-societies">3.2. Stratified societies</h3>
<p>A very few Polynesian societies, most notably those of Hawaii, Tonga
and the Society Is., had at the start of the colonial era a feudal
system in which a chiefly class ruled over a class of commoners. Land
was held by the chiefs, with commoners as tenants. Marriage between
nobles and commoners was proscribed. This extreme degree of
stratification most likely developed independently in each of these
societies and reached its zenith at the beginning of the colonial era.
We will consider the Tongan case.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-2-1"></a></p>
<h4 id="tonga">3.2.1. Tonga</h4>
<p>With a land area of only 696 km2, the Tongan group is much smaller in
geographical extent and poorer in natural resources than the Hawaiian
(16,600 km2) and Society (1535 km2) groups. It contains one relatively
large island, Tongatapu, with its satellites in the south, and two
clusters of smaller islands in the north, the Ha’apai and Vava’u groups.
Nevertheless, Tonga at first contact was densely populated (estimated
40,000) and had developed a highly stratified, feudal society in which
all the land was owned by an aristocracy ruling a commoner class of
landless tenants, who served as the chief’s labour force and provided
warriors in times of war.</p>
<p>Tongan aristocracy combined ranking by seniority of birth in the male
line, with a pattern of bilateral ranking based on superiority of
sisters and sisters’ sons to brothers and brothers’ sons. The first
factor established rank, the second shaped deference and respect.</p>
<p>Chiefly lineages had a classical Polynesian conical clan
organisation: major lineages branched into lower-order segments, with
succession to titles in the higher-order lineages strictly patrilineal.
The supreme chief was semi-divine and sometimes referred to as a god.
Adherence to primogeniture was strongest in the highest-ranking
lineages. Junior chiefs from outside the leading families could compete
to succeed to a title.</p>
<p>In theory, all chiefs were related by descent from an original
supreme chief, the Tuʔi Tonga. However, <a
href="../sources/Gifford1929">Gifford</a> (<a
href="../sources/Gifford1929">1929</a>) could not find genealogies
outside the royal line going back beyond about AD 1600. The archipelago
was politically unstable between 1600 and 1800, with frequent
assassinations of paramount chiefs. Oral history records that Tonga was
seldom under a single chief. Rather, a number of high chiefs ruled
separate domains. The secular authority of the Tuʔi Tonga was limited to
his home island, Tongatapu. Outlying islands owed him first fruits but
not political tribute.</p>
<p><a id="p-162"></a></p>
<p><em>ʔeiki</em> is a broader category of chiefly rank below
<em>tuʔi</em>. It was extended by courtesy to all kin of a chief. A
distinction was made between high chiefs (<em>’eiki motu</em>, <em>ʔeiki
taupoto</em> or <em>ʔeiki toho</em>) and petty chiefs (<em>ʔeiki
siʔi</em>).</p>
<p>Chiefs made large ceremonial displays of food, the burden of supply
falling on the tenants who served as the labour force. Under the Tuʔi
Tonga were four high chiefs who served as ministers with ritual duties.
<em>Matāpule</em> were ceremonial attendants of chiefs, the
highest-ranking <em>matāpule</em> being himself a chief with authority
over lower-ranking <em>matāpule</em>.</p>
<p>The Tuʔi Tonga was too sacred to fight. A cadre of professional
warriors (<em>toa</em>) drawn from <em>matāpule</em> families were part
of the royal court. High chiefs were not priests. Priests performed
minor duties at shrines and served offerings to the gods. Their standing
depended on rank of the lineage and its gods.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-3"></a></p>
<h3 id="open-societies">3.3. Open societies</h3>
<p>As examples of open societies Goldman cites Samoa, Niue, Marquesas,
Mangaia and Rapanui. Although he places Futuna in the traditional
category it shows some features of his open class and I include it here.
Notes on Samoa and Futuna follow.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-3-1"></a></p>
<h4 id="samoa">3.3.1. Samoa</h4>
<p>Samoan society lacked ramified descent groups. The core kinship unit
was the <em>ʔāiŋa</em>, an indefinitely extended bilateral kindred with
branches representing hierarchically ranked segments. Every extended
family was headed by one or more high chiefs (<em>aliʔi paʔia</em>).
Each high chief was paired with a junior chief, <em>tulāfale</em>, who
served as orator (‘talking chief’) and came from the female line. There
was some recognition of primogeniture and descent lines and patrilineal
succession but primogeniture played a weak role in the assignment of
chiefly titles. The highest ranked titles were transmitted through the
male line (<em>tama tāne</em>). The female line (<em>tama fafine</em>)
had the power to curse, through the father’s sister.</p>
<p>Administrative powers in a village were held by the <em>fono</em>,
village council of chiefs. The transmission of high ranked chiefly
titles was under the jurisdiction of the <em>fono</em>. The chiefly
title of <em>tāupōu</em> ‘village maiden’ was held by a high-ranking
female who had charge of the <em>aualuma</em> ‘association of unmarried
women of a village, with various formal duties’. The Great <em>Fono</em>
was a conceptual body, which never met, representing all of Samoa.</p>
<p>The title of <em>tui</em>, followed by the name of a district, was
given to the paramount chief of that district. In pre-European Samoa ten
districts were recognised. Before the Tongan invasion (possibly ca AD
1200) the <em>Tui Manuʔa</em> title held the highest rank in Samoa. The
person and belongings of the <em>Tui Manuʔa</em> were sacred and
dangerous, but political and economic authority was lodged in local
autonomous districts. In the early 19th century a chief of the Malietoa
family had conquered the whole of Samoa but his power was limited to
rank and title, not extending to economic control.</p>
<p>The wealth of chiefs was measured in terms of valuable goods,
especially <em>ʔie toŋa</em> ‘fine mats’, <em>siapo</em> ‘bark-cloth’,
and <em>ʔoloa</em> ‘valuable goods’. Samoa, with its three large
islands, had extensive areas of fertile land, allowing production of a
food surplus. The distribution of food in feasts accented the social
position of chiefs.</p>
<p><a id="p-163"></a></p>
<p>The patron-craftsman relationship stood outside the traditional
system of genealogical rank. Craftsmen held the title of
<em>tufuŋa</em>. The highest status crafts were those of canoe builder,
carpenter and tattooer. Craft titles were transmitted in descent
lines.</p>
<p>Chiefs were priests, <em>taula</em>. Some priests were concerned with
family gods, higher order priests with great gods.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-3-2"></a></p>
<h4 id="futuna">3.3.2. Futuna</h4>
<p>The Futuna or Hoorn group consists of two islands, Futuna and Alofi,
that in early colonial times supported a population of 3000-4000, most
living on the larger island, Futuna. Land shortage was a pressing
problem often leading to war.</p>
<p>There are three levels of rank: <em>aliki sau</em> ‘high chiefs’,
<em>aliki</em> ‘sub-chiefs’ and <em>seka</em> ‘commoners, including
untitled members of chiefly lineages’. By colonial times the main island
was divided into two districts each with its own <em>aliki sau</em>.
Each clan in turn divides into a number of ramages (<em>kutuŋa</em>),
each having its own chief (<em>aliki</em> or <em>launiu</em>), with the
paramount chief being from the highest ranked ramage. The landholding
groups are <em>kāiŋa</em>, a term that refers to both the group of
landowners and to the segment of land they own.</p>
<p>Seniority of birth was important but not the major factor in
qualification for chiefly office. Chiefs came from important families
but were selected on the basis of their accomplishments. Distinguished
warriors (given the title of <em>toa</em>) were potential chiefs and
sometimes usurped royalty.</p>
<p>Chiefs were expected to move freely among their people and to work in
the gardens and as craftsmen. Commoners owed their chiefs respect but
not servility. But chiefs were set apart in various ways. They were
spokesmen for the ancestral gods. They were the instigators and
organisers of war. Certain foods – turtles and certain birds and fish –
were reserved for them. The <em>fasu</em> institution (special rights
given to sister’s children) was restricted to chiefs in earlier times.
They had highest status in the kava circle. A village council
(<em>fono</em>) dealt with mundane village affairs, chiefs with more
elevated matters, such as warfare, and the imposing and lifting of tapu.
Symbols of rank were important. There is an honorific vocabulary, used
in addressing chiefs.</p>

<h2 id="issues-with-ancestral-polynesian-society">4. Issues with
‘ancestral Polynesian society’</h2>
<p><a href="../sources/Kirch1984">Kirch</a> (<a
href="../sources/Kirch1984">1984</a>) and <a
href="../sources/KirchGreen1987">Kirch and Green</a> (<a
href="../sources/KirchGreen1987">1987</a>) conclude that ancestral
Polynesian society had chiefdoms corresponding to the ‘traditional’
type, exemplified by Tikopia and New Zealand Maori, and that those
Polynesian societies with very high or very low levels of stratification
represent later developments. In this respect they are in accord with
some previous commentators on the evolution of Polynesian societies,
such as <a href="../sources/Sahlins1957">Sahlins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Sahlins1957">1957</a>, <a
href="../sources/Sahlins1963">1963</a>), <a

href="../sources/Koskinen1960">1960</a>) and <a
href="../sources/Goldman1970">Goldman</a> (<a
href="../sources/Goldman1970">1970</a>).</p>
<p>Following Sahlins, Kirch and Green argue that the organisational
basis of ancestral Polynesian society was the conical clan, a group
claiming descent from a common ancestor, ranked and segmented along
genealogical lines. Descent groups of this kind are typically associated
with terms for same-sex siblings distinguished by seniority of birth
(PPn <em>*tuqakana</em> ‘older sibling of same sex’, <em>*tahina</em>
‘younger sibling of same sex’; see <a
href="../contributions/6-4#s-3-5-1">§3.5.1</a>.5.1–2). <a
href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">Kirch and Green</a> (<a
href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">2001</a>:231) define PPn
<em>*qariki</em> as ‘the senior male, titled leader of a social group,
probably the <em>*kainaŋa</em>, who typically inherited his position
patrilineally within the senior ranked line of this group, and who acted
as the group’s secular as well as ritual leader.’</p>
<p><a id="p-164"></a></p>
<p>By virtue of their inherited rank <em>*qariki</em> had <em>mana</em>
‘supernatural efficacy, the power to make things happen’ and were
<em>tapu</em> ‘sacred, set apart by taboos’. A chief had important
sacred duties to perform relating to the well-being of his subjects,
such as ensuring success in growing crops and in communal fishing
activities.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">Kirch and Green</a> (<a
href="../sources/KirchandGreen2001">2001</a>:231) propose that their
extended definition of the roles of a priest-chief in ancestral
Polynesian society allows one to trace, in some detail, transformations
that have occurred in particular societies after the breakup of the PPn
speech community. In more conservative societies, chiefs retained both
their secular and sacred roles and continued to be associated with
descent groups. In many Polynesian societies, however, a functional
separation between sacred and secular roles developed. This was
particularly so in Eastern Polynesia, corresponding to the widespread
importance of a priestly class. Yet another kind of transformation
accompanied the breakdown of the ancient <em>*kainaŋa</em>-type social
groups and their replacement with strictly territorial groupings, in
which chiefs became the owners of such land units: Hawaii and Tonga both
exemplify this kind of change.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Dye1987">Dye</a> (<a
href="../sources/Dye1987">1987</a>) is sceptical of Kirch and Green’s
(1987) definition of the role of PPn <em>*qariki</em>, remarking that
their reconstruction “is modeled on the rights, duties, and modes of
succession associated with chiefs of contact-era societies in possession
of full land situations” (<a href="../sources/Dye1987">Dye
1987</a>:445-446). He doubts whether these institutions could have
existed in the pioneering phase of settlement, when a founding community
of fewer than 100 people occupied an island covered with virgin
forest.</p>
<p>However, PPn was not the language of a small first-generation,
founding population but of communities which had lived in western
Polynesia for many centuries, during which time the innovations defining
the Polynesian subgroup developed and spread across this region. The
initial colonisation of the different islands in the Polynesian Triangle
and of the Outliers must have involved many cases where a small founding
population settled uninhabited islands, and it is striking that similar
beliefs and practices associated with chieftainship survived these
foundation events. That indicates that the founding populations carried
the ideology with them.</p>
<p><a id="s-5"></a></p>
<h2 id="rank-and-leadership-in-proto-oceanic-society">5. Rank and
leadership in Proto Oceanic society</h2>
<p>We turn now to a consideration of rank and leadership in Proto
Oceanic society. Reconstruction of the lexicon of POc is less
straightforward than is the case for PPn. An etymon can be attributed to
POc if it is reflected in (a) at least two first order subgroups of
Oceanic or (b) in an Oceanic language and a non-Oceanic Austronesian
language.</p>
<p>A problem is that the first-order subgrouping of Oceanic is not
clear-cut (see <a href="#fig-6-1_2">Figure 1.2</a>). There are several
candidates for first-order subgroups in western Melanesia: the
Admiralties, Mussau and Western Oceanic, and several in southeast
Melanesia and the central Pacific: Southeast Solomonic, Temotu,
Micronesian, Vanuatu, New Caledonia-Loyalties, and Central Pacific. To
meet criterion (a) a conservative procedure is to require that an etymon
be reflected in at least one subgroup in NW Melanesia and one outside NW
Melanesia.</p>

Political systems in Oceanic-speaking societies of Melanesia</h3>
<p>In an influential and controversial paper <a
href="../sources/Sahlins1963">Sahlins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Sahlins1963">1963</a>) sought to explain the larger
size of polities found in certain Polynesian societies, running into the
thousands, compared with the smaller scale polities, ranging from 70 to
300 people, characteristic of many societies in NW Melanesia. Central to
his explanation are differences in the nature of rank and
leadership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Polynesian advance in political scale was supported by an advance
over Melanesia in political structure […] The characteristic western
Melanesian “tribe”, that is, the ethnic-cultural entity, consists of
many autonomous kinship-residential groups. Amounting on the ground to a
small village or a local cluster of hamlets, each of these is a copy of
the others in political status. The tribal plan is one of politically
unintegrated segments – segmental. But the political geometry in
Polynesia is pyramidal […] Smaller units are integrated onto large
through a system of intergroup ranking, and the network of
representative chiefs of the subdivisions amounts to a coordinating
political structure. So instead of the Melanesian scheme of small,
separate and equal political blocks, the Polynesian polity is an
extensive pyramid of groups capped by the family and following of a
paramount chief (<a href="../sources/Sahlins1963">Sahlins
1963</a>:287).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commentators have pointed out that a simple Melanesian/Polynesian
dichotomy in systems of rank and leadership is not justified (<a
href="../sources/Chowning1979">Chowning 1979</a>; <a
href="../sources/Douglas1979">Douglas 1979</a>; <a
href="../sources/Hage1999b">Hage 1999b</a>; <a
href="../sources/Sand2002">Sand 2002</a>). Forms of hereditary
leadership based on rank are found in various Oceanic-speaking
communities of Papua New Guinea, e.g. in the Admiralty Islands (<a

<p><a href="../sources/Sahlins1963">Sahlins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Sahlins1963">1963</a>:286) acknowledges that “in
eastern Melanesia, New Caledonia and Fiji for example, political
approximations of the Polynesian condition became common” but he finds
that political structures showing an extensive pyramid of genealogically
ranked groups are characteristically Polynesian. Extensive regional
trading systems linking scores of local communities have developed in
various parts of western Melanesia, but these produced “at best, an
ephemeral sort of political association” (<a

of Melanesia that have a form of hereditary chieftainship.</p>

<h4 id="new-caledonia">5.1.1. New Caledonia</h4>
<p><a href="../sources/Douglas1979">Douglas</a> (<a
href="../sources/Douglas1979">1979</a>:16-18) describes traditional New
Caledonian socio-political organisation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[It] centred on localized, patrilineal and patri-virilocal clans, and
on tribes, aggregates of clans paying allegiance to the chief of one of
their number […] clan members claimed common descent and owed allegiance
to a hereditary chief, in theory the genealogically senior man of the
senior lineage; a tribe was regarded as a group of related clans with a
common founding ancestor, which paid allegiance to the senior male
member of the senior lineage of the original clan. The chief was a
clan’s ‘great (first-born) son’ […] Neither the ideology of common
descent nor that of chiefly seniority was necessarily borne out in
practice, however […] Both clans and tribes commonly absorbed unrelated
individuals and groups, and rationalized the process in kinship terms.
Ideology was thus satisfied, but common residence was in practice a key
factor in group cohesion. A newcomer was sometimes installed as chief by
earlier inhabitants who nonetheless continued to exercise covert
authority through their control of land […] A clan or tribal chief […]
enjoyed many prerogatives and possessed authority because of his role as
intermediary between the group and its ancestral spirits […] The chief
was neither the sole office holder nor the only decision maker. He
shared authority with such dignitaries as the war chief, master of the
soil, priests and powerful sorcerers, who with respected elders formed
an advisory council which assisted the chief to reach the consensus on
which group action was usually based […] The sanctity of New Caledonian
chiefs and the deference to which they were entitled rested on their
implied genealogical connexions with deified ancestors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-166"></a></p>
<p>Douglas comments that in degree of political stratification New
Caledonian leadership resembles ‘mid-range’ Polynesian societies
(corresponding to Goldman’s ‘traditional’ type) such as Maori, though
the descent ideology was probably more flexible than in the Maori
case.</p>

href="../sources/Hauofa1981">Hau’ofa</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hauofa1981">1981</a>) describe Mekeo society in the
early colonial period, when tribal warfare was still ongoing. Key
institutions were the hereditary offices of the high chief or civilian
chief (<em>lopia faʔa</em>) and the war chief (<em>iso lopia</em>, more
commonly simply <em>iso</em>), the official sorcerers (<em>uŋauŋa</em>)
and the war magicians (<em>faiʔa</em>). A village is made up of
agnatically related subclans, ranked in order of seniority of descent
from older vs younger brothers.</p>
<p>Each subclan should have both a civilian chief and a war chief,
representing a fundamental division of authority between the civilian
and military spheres in Mekeo society. High chiefs do not take an active
part in warfare but are regarded as men of peace whose authority rests
on their control of sorcerers, and so of life and death. War chiefs are
dangerous men of anger and violence valued for their military prowess.
High chiefs are ceremonially installed. <a
href="../sources/Hauofa1981">Hau’ofa</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hauofa1981">1981</a>:185) observes that in a large
subclan the civilian chieftainship is divided between the <em>lopia
faʔa</em> and a junior chief (<em>lopia eke</em>). The junior chief
performs certain ritual duties on behalf of the high chief in the
<em>ufuapie</em> ceremonial feasts.</p>
<p>When large clans segment the junior branch is headed by a junior
chief. Once a particular chieftainship is established, be it senior or
junior, succession to the office becomes hereditary from father to son,
with the qualification that only a successful warrior can succeed to a
war chieftainship. The father sometimes chooses a junior son or an
adopted son to succeed him but only if the eldest son is not
suitable.</p>
<p>Chiefs’ houses differ from those of other villagers in that they are
built parallel to the central ground and have special roof designs.
Chiefs were not wealthy but derived their prestige and authority from
their rank, personality, numerical strength of their group and command
of certain kinds of magic.</p>
<p>Mekeo believe that powers of sorcery (<em>uŋauŋa</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>were given personally by the deity, A’aisa, to certain men who
founded some of their present-day sorcery families. They believe that
when A’aisa created their political organization by an edict he
appointed two kinds of hereditary leaders, the military and the
civilian. For the civilian leadership he appointed some men as chiefs
and others to enforce the authority of the chiefs. Sorcery lineages
which have risen from these appointments are the most prestigious in the
land. (<a href="../sources/Hauofa1981">Hau’ofa 1981</a>:230)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-167"></a></p>
<p>Hereditary leaders, particularly sorcerers, usually acquire one or
more kinds of non-sorcery magic which they incorporate in their arsenal
of powers. These enhance their prestige and at the same time allow them
additional sources of wealth.</p>

<p>Baluan, a society of the Admiralty Is., is described by <a
href="../sources/Otto1994">Otto</a> (<a
href="../sources/Otto1994">1994</a>) as thoroughly hierarchical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ascribed hierarchy was without a doubt a pervasive trait of Baluan
society at the end of the nineteenth century. It was expressed in
various ways: birth-order name, kinship terminology, a system of dual
rank, ranked titles for leaders, and material signs of distinction (<a
href="../sources/Otto1994">Otto 1994</a>:224) Hierarchy was not based on
ascription or achievement alone, but on a specific articulation of these
two principles […] The relative ranking of leaders of high rank was
determined by their success in warfare and feast-giving. The status of a
<em>lapan</em> [chiefly] lineage would be eroded by inadequate
performance, although they could continue claiming the title for several
generations. The <em>lapan</em> stories show clearly that <em>lapan</em>
status could also be appropriated through violence […]” (<a

Manam (Schouten Islands, off north coast of Papua New Guinea)</h4>
<p><a href="../sources/Wedgwood1934">Wedgwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Wedgwood1934">1934</a>) reports that in Manam society
descent is patrilineal, residence is patrilocal and leadership is
hereditary, based on primogeniture. There are two named social groups,
the aristocracy (<em>tanepoa</em> or <em>tanepwa</em>) and the commoners
(<em>gadagada</em>). Membership in these groups is based on birth. The
village chief, <em>tanepoa labalaba</em>, literally ‘big chief’, is the
“senior male descendant in the male line of the original founder of the
village” (Wedgewood 1934:383). The chief’s sons and younger brothers are
called <em>tanepoa siʔisiʔi</em>, literally ‘little chief’. There is a
strong preference for marriage between chiefly families. <a
href="../sources/Lutkehaus1990">Lutkehaus</a> (<a
href="../sources/Lutkehaus1990">1990</a>) states that <em>tanepoa</em>
were believed to inherit from their ancestors special <em>marou</em>, a
form of supernatural power or <em>mana</em>, with both benign and malign
aspects. “Its benign form was manifested in a <em>tanepwa</em>’s ability
to produce abundant taro in his gardens, to protect his village against
illness and strife, to promote his village’s reputation through the
organization of large and munificent pig-exchange celebrations” (<a
href="../sources/Lutkehaus1990">Lutkehaus 1990</a>:300) and through
success in amassing valuables from mainland trading partners. The dark
side of <em>marou</em> was its association with sorcery, which a chief
was able to control.</p>
<p><a id="s-5-1-5"></a></p>
<h4 id="saa-malaita-solomon-is.">5.1.5. Sa’a (Malaita, Solomon Is.)</h4>
<p>The Sa’a occupy the island of Small Malaita in the Southeast
Solomons. Their society around the end of the 19th century is described
by <a href="../sources/Codrington1891">Codrington</a> (<a
href="../sources/Codrington1891">1891</a>) and <a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens</a> (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">1927</a>). They made a sharp distinction
between chiefs (<em>alaha</em>) and commoners (<em>apoloa</em>). Descent
is patrilineal. Chieftainship is hereditary. The reciting of genealogies
is practised. Ivens recorded one genealogy going back 39 generations.
Sons can be adopted to ensure succession. Codrington (1991:50) writes
that</p>
<p><a id="p-168"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he chief’s power at Sa’a comes from his birth and personal
qualities, not from his intimacy with supernatural beings and his
magical knowledge, [although] he may well have these […] He inherits
wealth from his father, and adds to it by the fines he imposes and by
the gifts of his people, but no wealth or success in war could make a
man a chief at Sa’a if not born of the chief’s family. Chiefs lived in
more substantial buildings than commoners. The <em>toohi</em> ‘chief’s
lodge’ is the reception house for all visitors of importance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chiefs were not allowed to go into battle. Their main social function
was the provision of feasts. The <em>malaohu</em> (initiation of boys
into bonito fishing) system was also under their control. The head wife
of a chief is chosen from among the girls of neighbouring places who
themselves are <em>alaha</em>. His other wives may be <em>apoloa</em>.
If the head wife has no male heir, a son of one of the other wives
succeeds to the chieftainship.</p>
<p>The persons of chiefs were sacred to the extent that anyone who
cursed them or the marks of their chiefly position, their gongs or
official houses, was marked down for death. The relics of deceased
chiefs, their skulls, were held in especial reverence. The common people
paid honour to both chief and priest; the one was the glory of the place
and the other served ghosts who either had been chiefs themselves or
were connected with chiefs through the bonito fishing. It was customary
for the commoner to make offerings of garden produce to the chief and of
cooked food to the priest; and no return was made or expected. Chief and
priest were exempted from the obligation to make a return for gifts
received which always held in the case of commoners.</p>

<h3
id="distributional-and-other-arguments-for-attributing-hereditary-chieftainship-to-proto-oceanic-society">5.2.
Distributional and other arguments for attributing hereditary
chieftainship to Proto Oceanic society</h3>
<p>Hereditary chieftainship is found in societies speaking languages
belonging to almost every major subgroup of Oceanic. By contrast, as far
as I am aware, none of the more than 700 non-Austronesian language
communities of Melanesia have hereditary chiefs. This is a strong
distributional argument in favour of attributing hereditary
chieftainship to POc society. It is highly unlikely that such an
institution would have arisen independently in many different Oceanic
societies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as <a href="../sources/Hage1999a">Hage</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hage1999a">1999a</a>,b) points out, POc kinship
terminology makes it probable that POc society had unilineal descent
groups based on seniority of birth. Milke’s (1958) reconstruction of POc
kin terms is diagnostic of a unilineal system, distinguishing as it does
between terms for father’s brother (<em>*tama</em>) and mother’s brother
(probably <em>*matuqa</em>), and between terms for mother’s sister
(<em>*tina</em>) and father’s sister (<em>*aia</em> or <em>*aya</em>), a
pattern which cross-culturally strongly equates with unilineal descent
groups (85% correlation in Murdock’s worldwide survey; <a
href="../sources/Murdock1947">Murdock 1947</a>, <a
href="../sources/Murdock1967">1967</a>). There is a widespread
association between such a terminology and descent group organisation
and exogamy, such that a parent’s opposite-sex siblings will always be
in a different descent group from their same-sex siblings (see <a
href="../contributions/6-4#s-3-2-3">§3.2.3</a>).</p>
<p>The highly marked status of the seniority distinction in terms for
siblings of the same sex in Oceanic societies also implies the existence
in POc society of a conical clan system</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in which all individuals and all descent lines theoretically have
unique ranks. This ranking is generated by a rule of […] primogeniture
in the Oceanic case, which distinguishes elder siblings from younger
siblings […] and descendants of elder and younger siblings […]
Primogeniture is reflected in the seniority distinction in [Proto
Oceanic] sibling terminology and more emphatically in the marked status
of the term for elder (parallel) sibling. In a number of [Oceanic]
terminologies, e.g. Fijian, the term for younger (parallel) sibling can
be used generically to mean sibling irrespective of age (or sex) while
the term for elder (parallel) sibling can only have this specific
meaning, reflecting the special, elevated position of this relation […]
Titles are passed down the senior lines, and members of more senior
lines form an upper, chiefly class while members of more junior lines
form a lower, commoner class, for example, ’<em>eiki</em> […] and
<em>tua</em> as in Tonga, <em>iroij</em> and <em>kajur</em> as in the
Marshall Islands, and <em>lapan</em> and <em>lau</em> as in the
Admiralties.” (<a href="../sources/Hage1999a">Hage 1999a</a>:208)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-169"></a></p>
<p>A further argument, mentioned earlier, for supposing that Lapita
society was stratified stems from the very rapid colonisation of all the
major island groups of the southwest Pacific after the initial Lapita
movements into this region. This achievement required considerable
capital investment in skilled labour to build ocean-going sailing
canoes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It required the recruitment of crews
and passengers in sufficient numbers to form viable founding
populations, and the transport of useful plants and breeding stocks of
domestic animals. It implies the existence of prestigious leaders who
could plan and command these undertakings.</p>
<p>This point is well made by <a href="../sources/Hayden1983">Hayden</a>
(<a href="../sources/Hayden1983">1983</a>) who argued that boats and
trade are the key to understanding the maintenance of social
stratification in Polynesia and other regions initially settled by
Lapita people. He notes that the construction of a single medium-sized
ocean-going canoe took from one to three years, and canoe builders were
specialists trained through a rigid system of apprenticeship.</p>

<h4 id="poc-tau-lapat-chief-or-big-man">5.2.1. POc <em>*ta(u)-lapat</em>
‘chief’ or ‘big-man’?</h4>
<p>If POc society had hereditary chiefs, what were they called? Are
cognates of PPn <em>*qariki</em> present in other branches of
Oceanic?</p>
<p>C.E. <a href="../sources/Fox1924">Fox</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fox1924">1924</a>, <a
href="../sources/Fox1970">1970</a>) noted that Arosi, a Southeast
Solomonic language of Makira, has a pair of terms <em>araha</em> ‘chief’
and <em>ariʔi</em> ‘eldest son of a chief’ (the latter used in songs).
The eldest son became chief before his father’s death. Fox asserted that
each of these Arosi terms can be analysed into a personal article
<em>a</em>, and an adjective, <em>raha</em> ‘big, great’ or
<em>riʔi</em> ‘little, small’. That is to say, <em>a-raha</em> is
literally ‘Great one’ and <em>a-riʔi</em> is ‘Little one’, i.e. the
chief’s heir. Arosi <em>a</em> is preposed to “names native or foreign;
used with nouns to personify; with verbs or adjectives to form a
descriptive noun or nickname” (<a href="../sources/Fox1970">Fox
1970</a>:1). A cognate article is found in some other Oceanic languages,
including Polynesian, where it precedes personal names and/or, in some
languages, place names (<a href="../sources/Pawley1972">Pawley
1972</a>:58).</p>
<p>In <a href="../sources/Pawley1982a">Pawley</a> (<a
href="../sources/Pawley1982a">1982a</a>), I accepted Fox’s claim that
Arosi <em>ariʔi</em> is cognate with PPn <em>*qariki</em> and observed
that cognates of Arosi <em>araha</em> denoting a chief or person of a
chiefly descent group occur in several languages of the Malaita-Makira
subgroup in the Southeast Solomons, supporting the reconstruction of
Proto Malaita-Makira <em>*alafa</em> ‘chief’:</p>

<p>In line with Fox’s analysis of Arosi <em>araha</em>, I treated Proto
Malaita-Makira <em>*alafa</em> as consisting of a personal article
<em>*a</em> and a nominalised adjective <em>*lafa</em> ‘big, great’.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk</a> (<a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">1986</a>:351) proposed a different
analysis. He argued that Proto Malaita-Makira <em>*alafa</em> comes from
POc <em>*ta-la(m)pat</em>, where <em>*ta-</em> was a reduced form of the
well-attested noun <em>*tau</em> ‘man, person’, preceding
<em>*la(m)pat</em> ‘big, great’.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> POc <em>*t</em> is
regularly lost in all positions in Malaita-Makira languages.</p>
<p>Lichtenberk also gave a phonological reason for reconstructing
<em>*ta</em> rather than <em>*a</em>. This has to do with the order in
which certain sound changes occurred in Malaita-Makira languages (<a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk 1986</a>, <a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk1988">1988</a>:41). POc <em>*q</em> had
already been lost before PMaMa separated from other SES languages. Next,
a sporadic but frequent change of word-initial <em>*a</em> to
<em>*θa</em> (theta-prothesis) spread across Malaita-Makiran. Initial
<em>θ</em> then became <em>s</em> in several Malaitan languages,
<em>l</em> in Kwaio but remained <em>θ</em> in To’aba’ita.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> so
that, for example, POc <em>*qalipan</em> ‘centipede’ is reflected as
To’aba’ita <em>θāfila</em> (metathesis), Lau <em>saruhe</em>, ’Are’are
<em>rarihe</em>, Kwaio <em>lalifa</em>, Oroha <em>saruhe</em>, but Sa’a
<em>ɛluhe</em>, Ulawa <em>aliha</em> (<a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk 1986</a>:36). Subsequently
POc <em>*t</em> was regularly lost in MaMa. If the protoform had been
PEOc <em>*qa-lapat</em>, it would have undergone the following sequence
of changes: <em>*qalapat</em> &gt; PMaMa <em>*a-lafa</em> &gt;
post-PMaMa <em>*θa-lafa</em>. But the forms listed above show no sign of
theta-prothesis, pointing instead to the sequence PEOc
<em>*ta-lapat</em> &gt; PMaMa <em>*a-lafa</em></p>
<p>Lichtenberk was uncertain as to whether his POc <em>*tala(m)pat</em>
referred to a hereditary chief or to a self-made big-man. He
comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The literal meaning of <em>*tala(m)pat</em> was ‘big [person], great
person’, and it referred to a leader, as do its reflexes in the
[Makira-Malaitan] languages […] Given its literal meaning one might be
tempted to conclude that the expression referred to a big-man rather
than a chief. However, this conclusion is not warranted. The literal
meaning under-determines the denotation of <em>*tala(m)pat</em>. It is
compatible with the denotation ‘chief’ just as well as […] ‘big-man’.
(<a href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk 1986</a>:351)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-171"></a></p>
<p>Lichtenberk was apparently not aware that many Oceanic languages of
the Admiralties reflect <em>*lapa-ña</em> ‘chief, leader’, analysable
into a nominal root <em>*lapa</em> (homophonous with Proto Admiralties
<em>*lapa</em> ‘big, great’) and a suffix <em>*-ña</em>, reflected as
<em>-n</em> in many Admiralties languages, which marks singular
agreement on an adjective.</p>

<p>The agreement between languages from four widely dispersed subgroups
(Malaita-Makira, Admiralties, Western Oceanic and Micronesian) suggests
that in POc the adjective <em>*lapat</em> ‘big, great’ also had the
senses ‘genealogically senior’ and ‘of chiefly rank’, and occurred as
the modifier in one or more compound nouns denoting a chief or person of
chiefly rank. One such compound noun was probably <em>*ta(u)-lapat</em>,
where the head noun was <em>*tau</em> ‘man, person’.</p>
<p>Note also the title of the high chief of Nadrogā (SW Vitilevu) is
<em>kʷālevu</em>, lit ‘the big one’, contrasting with <em>kʷāhewa</em>,
lit ‘the small one’, his child.</p>
<p>One other term for chief or leader can be reconstructed, with
reflexes in two Admiralties and two New Ireland languages.</p>

<p>It was noted in <a href="../contributions/6-4#s-4-5-2">§4.5.2</a>.1
that PPn <em>*qariki</em> ‘chief’ resembles Arosi <em>ariʔi</em>
‘first-born son of a chief, chief’s heir’, and that this has led some to
conclude that these forms are cognate, each historically analysable as
consisting of a personal article and a reflex of POc <em>*riki</em>
‘little’. The sound correspondences are regular. However, Arosi
<em>ariʔi</em> has cognates in several Malaitan languages, and, as <a
href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk</a> (<a

<p>Lichtenberk argues that the Malaitan cognates continue a Proto
Malaitan form <em>*a-ariki</em> that consisted of two morphemes:
<em>*a</em> ‘personal article’ and <em>*ariki</em> which he glossed as
‘unmarried girl, maiden, daughter’. Contemporary Malaitan languages have
accreted a prothetic consonant to the personal article <em>*a</em> and
other roots beginning with the vowel <em>*a</em>.</p>
<p>How are the differences of meaning between the Polynesian, Arosi and
Malaitan forms to be resolved? Lichtenberk suggests that the most likely
meaning in their common ancestral language was ‘oldest child’. <a
href="../sources/Chowning1991">Chowning</a> (<a
href="../sources/Chowning1991">1991</a>:63) points to Mussau
<em>aliki</em> ‘child’ and Bariai (New Britain) <em>galiki</em>
‘firstborn child’ as possible cognates, and suggests ‘child’ (as an
age-grade term, not a kinship term) as the meaning in POc. We may note
the existence of the well supported POc etymon <em>*natu-</em> ‘child’
(kinship term, requiring a possessor) but it is usual for Oceanic
languages to have distinct terms for ‘child’ as a kinship term and as an
age grade term.</p>
<p>At some point in the history of Polynesian it may be that the term
<em>*qariki</em> ‘child’ was used as a nickname for the chief himself,
and that in PPn it became the conventional term for ‘chief’. A parallel
usage occurs in Samoan, where tama ‘boy, youth; son of a woman’ can
refer to chiefs of high rank and the compound <em>tama-ali’i</em> (lit.
‘chiefly boy’) as a noun denotes a chief and as a verb means ‘be of
noble descent or lineage’ (<a href="../sources/Milner1966">Milner
1966</a>). The holder of any of the four highest titles in Samoa is
known as <em>tama-ʔāiŋa</em> (lit. ‘boy of the lineage’). In Tongan
<em>tama</em> ‘child, son especially of a woman’ also has the meaning
‘male of chiefly rank’. In Bauan Fijian <em>ŋone tūraŋa</em>, lit.
‘chiefly child’, is an honorific term for a chief (Paul Geraghty pers.
comm.).</p>

<p><a href="../sources/Lichtenberk1986">Lichtenberk</a> (<a

possible to reconstruct a term for ‘commoner’ for POc, this would be
strong evidence that POc society had chiefs.</p>
<p>Many Oceanic languages have a term or terms for people of low status
but no widespread cognates are found. Often a derogatory term meaning
‘useless, unimportant’ is involved.</p>

<p>New Caledonian languages usually have a term that means ‘subject of
(a chief)’. These include: in Pije, Fwâi, Nemi, Jawe, Nyelâyu and
Nêlêmwa <em>yabʷec</em>, Cèmuhî abʷɛ̄, Xârâcùù <em>kʷara</em> and Iaai
<em>kei-</em>. Most of these terms can occur with a collective
proclitic, and the Iaai term is directly possessed, e.g. <em>la
kei-ñ</em> ‘his subjects’, <em>la kei-k</em> ‘my subjects’ (<em>la</em>
‘collective’).</p>
<p>One candidate for ‘commoner’ is POc <em>*mʷala</em>, which <a
href="../sources/Blust1981c">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust1981c">1981c</a>) suggests may have been a noun

reconstructing <em>*mʷala</em> as a stative verb and adjective meaning
‘common, worthless’ and as a noun meaning ‘misfortune, lack of
prosperity’.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Proto Oceanic language can be associated with the Lapita culture
which appeared in the Bismarck Archipelago at about 3300-3200 BP. Around
3000 BP bearers of Lapita became the first people to settle island
groups of the southwest Pacific east of the main Solomons group, and
within the space of two or three centuries colonised Santa Cruz and the
Reef Is., Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. This was an
achievement that implies strong leadership, requiring as it did the
building of large ocean-going outrigger canoes, the recruitment of crews
and passengers and the transport of domestic animals and useful
plants.</p>
<p>A number of terms relating to chiefly authority and status are
attributable to Proto Polynesian, the daughter of POc that developed in
western Polynesia, with some regional variation, in the millennium or so
following colonisation by Lapita people. There is strong evidence that
speakers of PPn had ranked descent groups, probably termed *kainaŋa,
headed by hereditary chiefs, called <em>*qariki</em>, and that rank was
based on primogeniture.</p>
<p><a id="p-174"></a></p>
<p>In Melanesia, hereditary chieftainship based on primogeniture is also
found in societies representing several major subgroups of Oceanic but
is absent in societies speaking non-Austronesian languages. This is a
powerful distributional argument in favour of attributing hereditary
chieftainship to POc society. It is unlikely that that such an
institution would have arisen independently in many different Oceanic
societies. Furthermore, POc kinship terminology is of a type that makes
it probable that POc society had unilineal descent groups ranked by
seniority of birth.</p>
<p>Agreement between languages from four widely dispersed subgroups
(Admiralties, Western Oceanic, Malaita-Makiran and Micronesian) suggests
that in POc the adjective <em>*lapat</em> ‘big, great’ also had the
meanings ‘genealogically senior’ and ‘of chiefly rank’, and that it
occurred as a constituent in a compound noun denoting a chief or person
of chiefly rank, possibly <em>*ta(u)-lapat</em>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This paper discusses the origin and history of POc <em>*tabu</em>.
The term ‘taboo’ [PPn <em>*tapu</em>] was brought to western awareness
late in the 18th century by European travellers in Polynesia including
Captain James Cook, who recognised in its use a widespread system of
promulgating and enforcing a code both religious and political (<a
href="../sources/CookandKing1785">Cook &amp; King 1785</a>). It was
understood as a stative verb ‘prohibited’, and as a noun applicable both
to the ban and to the object or activity banned. Hence it could be
applied to places as being off limits, or a person might become subject
to taboo and hence treated in a certain way. People believed that
<em>tapu</em> restrictions were laid down by the gods or their heirs and
had to be scrupulously followed. Deviation meant misfortune, possibly
death. Where hereditary leadership was entrenched, as in Fiji and Tonga,
a certain veneration was due to the chief, who was deemed
<em>tabu</em>/<em>tapu</em>. As a result, certain forms of speech had to
be used, not only in speaking to him but in conversation about him,
while certain topics could not be mentioned in the chief’s presence.
Thus the prohibition included a sense of ‘untouchable because
sacred’.</p>
<p>Examples of taboo [<em>tapu</em>] noted by Cook involved prohibition
of certain activities or actions that centred on the king or important
chiefs. From the record of his historic journeys we find the following
(1785, vol.3:163–4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They apply the word taboo indifferently both to persons and things.
This word is also used to express anything sacred, or eminent, or
devoted. Thus the king of Owhyhee [Hawai’i] was called Eree-taboo; a
human victim, tangata-taboo; and in the same manner, among the Friendly
Islanders, Tonga, the island where the king resides, is named
Tonga-taboo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women are also tabooed, or forbidden to eat certain kinds of meats.
We also frequently saw several at their meals, who had the meat put into
their mouths by others; and on our asking the reason of this singularity
were told, that they were tabooed, or forbidden, to feed themselves.
This prohibition … was always laid on them, after they had assisted at
any funeral, or touched a dead body, and also on other occasions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-284"></a></p>
<p>Later, in Hawaii, it was noted (1785, vol.2:249) that, when local
people were confronted by an unfamiliar situation, as when visiting a
British ship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people here always asked, with great eagerness and signs of fear
to offend, whether any particular thing, which they desired to see, or
we were unwilling to show, was taboo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Mariner,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> who lived in Tonga from 1806 to
1810, provided a detailed description by a westerner of its practice (<a
href="../sources/Martin1827">Martin 1827</a>:220–224).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This word [<em>taboo</em>] has various shades of signification: it
means sacred or consecrated to a god, … it means prohibited or
forbidden, and is applied not only to the thing prohibited, but to the
prohibition itself, and frequently (when it is in sacred matters), to
the person who breaks the prohibition. Thus if a piece of ground or a
house be consecrated to a god, by express declaration, or the burial of
a great chief, it is said to be <em>taboo</em>. … If a person touches
the body of a dead chief, or any thing personally belonging to him, he
becomes <em>taboo</em>, and time alone can relieve him. Certain kinds of
food, as turtle, and a certain species of fish, from something in their
nature, are said to be <em>taboo</em>, and must not be eaten until a
small portion be first given to the gods. Any other kind of food may be
rendered <em>taboo</em> by a prohibition being laid on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mariner made clear (p.222) that not all taboos in Tonga were equally
sacred, describing an occasion when a temporary taboo was applied by the
chief to safeguard food supply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent certain kinds of food from growing scarce, a prohibition
or <em>taboo</em> is set on them for a time, as after the
<em>inachi</em>, or other great and repeated ceremonies; and which
<em>taboo</em> is afterwards removed by the ceremony called
<em>fuccalahi</em>. [<em>fakalahi</em> ‘increase’]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term was readily adopted by missionaries who followed closely on
the heels of the European explorers, and saw the concept as a useful
term befitting elements of their teaching of a Christian God. As a
consequence, the Polynesian term is believed to have spread into other
parts of the Oceanic world with the adoption of Christianity, either as
an extended meaning of an existing term, or as a new term, possibly
replacing a different term with related meaning. We have in fact
reconstructed two terms to POc, <em>*tabu</em> and <em>*pali</em>, with
similar meanings. Reflexes of the latter were evidently once widespread
but are now greatly reduced (see <a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-7">§10.7</a> below), presumably
replaced by reflexes of <em>*tabu</em>.</p>
<p>A second result of western contact was that the Polynesian
<em>tapu</em> term was rapidly adopted into familiar English usage as
taboo. The Macquarie dictionary defines <em>taboo</em> as ‘forbidden to
general use; placed under a prohibition’. Its emphasis is on the
socially prohibited rather than the sacred. Although Cook and others
recorded the term in their journals as ‘taboo’, that spelling carries
its current English meaning in this article unless it is from a direct
quotation. As can be seen from the cognate set below, the English term
is in some dictionaries used to define the local term.</p>

<h2 id="poc-tabu-and-its-reflexes">2. POc <em>*tabu</em> and its
reflexes</h2>
<p>Although reflexes are widespread throughout Oceania, apparently
related terms have been found beyond its borders only in two widely
separated regions of CEMP. One is Tanimbar, an island roughly midway
between the Bird’s Head of New Guinea and Arnhemland in Australia, where
two languages, Yamdena and Fordata, are spoken. Patrick McConvell (pers.
comm.) has questioned these terms as possible loans from Australian
languages.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The other is Numfor-Biak, islands
off Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesian Papua, where the term <em>kābus</em>,
although irregular, is considered a possible cognate by Blust in the<a
href="../sources/Blust1995">ACD.</a></p>
<p>In the<a href="../sources/Blust1995">ACD,</a> Blust reconstructs both
POc <em>*tabu</em> ‘forbidden, prohibited’ and POc <em>*tabuna</em>
‘dehortative: don’t’, but recognises that <em>*tabuna</em> includes the
root <em>*tabu</em>. The separate reconstruction of <em>*tabun</em> is
unnecessary, as final <em>-na</em> can be accounted for independently.
The root <em>*tabu</em> is reflected as both a stative verb ‘be
forbidden, prohibited’ and as a noun ‘prohibition; that which is
prohibited’. Reflexes of both word classes occur, with a suffix
reflecting POc <em>*-ña</em> P:3S, while noun reflexes sometimes carry
other possessor affixes. Thus in Molima <em>tabu-gu</em>, Kove
<em>tavu-ɣu</em> ‘my taboo, that which is taboo for me’ and Kove
<em>(ai)tavu</em> ‘her/his taboo, that which is taboo for her/him’,
<em>tabu-</em> is a directly (inalienably) possessed noun. Adjectives in
some Papuan Tip languages take possessor suffixes as markers of
agreement with the noun they modify, e.g. Iduna <em>tabu-tabu-na</em>
‘forbidden’ (modifying a singular noun). Languages of the Admiralties
and North Huon Gulf (Yabem, Bukawa) groups reflect <em>*-ña</em> as a
fossil on roots that are or were used as attributes, and this accounts
for the Admiralties reflexes below, where Proto Admiralty
<em>*tabu-n</em> meant ‘forbidden’, readily interpreted as dehortative
‘don’t’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

<h2 id="relevant-situations">3. Relevant situations</h2>
<p>From ethnographic descriptions we learn that <em>*tabu</em> reflexes
are pervasive in Polynesia, used widely but in variable situations
across North and Central Vanuatu (<a
href="../sources/Francois2022">François 2022</a>), occur a little less
in the southeast Solomons where they apply mainly to spiritual concerns,
and are found in very limited ways in western Melanesia, being
apparently not used at all in some places.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The following, however, appear to be contexts where <em>tabu</em>
prohibitions are shared across major subgroups</p>
<p><a id="s-3-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="food-restrictions-kin">3.1. Food restrictions (+ kin)</h3>
<p>Strong prohibitions exist throughout the Oceanic world on foodstuffs
being prepared or particular foodstuffs eaten by certain people at
particular times, such as pregnant or menstruating women or boys
undergoing initiation. Cook’s journals give numerous examples of
<em>tapu</em> situations where people, including chiefs, and people who
have handled dead bodies, could not handle food but had to be fed by
others (1785, vol.1:305, 350, vol.2:203). The following instance records
the reaction of several Tongans invited to share a meal aboard the
British ship (vol.1:286):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When dinner came upon table, not one of them would sit down, or eat a
bit of any thing that was served up. On expressing my surprise at this,
they were all taboo, as they said; which word has a very comprehensive
meaning; but in general signifies that a thing is forbidden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In western Oceanic communities, where <em>tabu</em> situations are
far fewer than in Polynesia, the most frequently tabued situations
involve consumption of food. Often a prohibition is restricted to
certain kin relationships. In Dobu (PT), <em>tabu-</em> (with pronominal
suffix) refers to ‘those [certain kin of deceased] who do not eat at a
mortuary feast’ (<a href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune 1963</a>:196).
<a href="../sources/Chowning1991">Chowning</a> (<a
href="../sources/Chowning1991">1991</a>:61) defines <em>tabu-gu</em> in
Molima (PT) as ‘food forbidden to me (limited to food)’. In Kove (NNG),
she defines <em>tavu-ɣu</em> as ‘a taboo as on eating s.t. or saying an
affine’s name’. In Yabem (NNG), <em>dabu(ŋ)</em> is defined as both a
noun, ‘[s.t.] forbidden to eat’ and a verb ‘abstain from eating certain
foods’. <a href="../sources/Bell1935b">Bell</a> (<a
href="../sources/Bell1935b">1935b</a>:175–198, 306–322) lists a number
of avoidance situations in Tanga (MM) [=Tangga], but most are labelled
by terms other than <em>*tabu</em> reflexes. An exception is
<em>tabun</em>, a funeral feast in which no other persons but the clan
of the dead man may take part. Also listed is <em>kuen tabun</em>, a
term for a coconut palm when its fruit is reserved for formal
presentation to certain womenfolk as a form of gratitude. Bell writes
that “although the word may appear to resemble <em>tapu</em>, it is not
used much in Tanga”. He adds: “the word seems to be used only to express
the exclusive nature of certain clan actions.” (p319).</p>
<p><a id="p-289"></a></p>
<p>In Petats (MM), <a href="../sources/Blackwood1935">Blackwood</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blackwood1935">1935</a>:480) writes that the
prohibitions which govern the daily lives of the people, given the term
<em>tsūbun</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, apply neither to places nor
persons, but to actions such as the eating of certain food by specified
persons or groups or at specified times, or the avoidance to be observed
between individuals who stand to each other in certain relationships. <a
href="../sources/Waterhouse1949">Waterhouse</a> (<a
href="../sources/Waterhouse1949">1949</a>) notes that, in Roviana,
<em>tabu</em> means ‘to put taboo under certain circumstances, on food’,
but he adds the proviso “perhaps an introduced term”.</p>
<p>Food restrictions dictated by <em>tabu</em> are not singled out for
special mention in descriptions of avoidance behaviour we have from
Southeast Solomonic languages (<a href="../sources/Hogbin1934b">Hogbin
1934b</a>, <a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>, <a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing 1982</a>), and they have a minor
role in northern Vanuatu, being mentioned only in relation to candidates
undergoing initiation rituals (<a
href="../sources/Francois2022">François 2022</a>:230).</p>
<p><a id="s-3-2"></a></p>
<h3 id="safeguarding-supply">3.2. Safeguarding supply</h3>
<p>Supply of foodstuffs may be subject to a temporary taboo, as
described by <a href="../sources/Martin1827">Martin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Martin1827">1827</a>) in Tonga (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-1">§10.1</a>) where it is applied by
chiefs to harvesting items such as coconuts prior to a major feast or in
the likelihood of future shortages. <a
href="../sources/Malinowski1922">Malinowski</a> (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1922">1922</a>:425) refers to
<em>kaytubutabu</em>, in the Trobriands, ‘a ban on the consumption of
coconuts and betelnuts associated with a specific magic to make them
grow’. <a href="../sources/Francois2022">François</a> (<a
href="../sources/Francois2022">2022</a>:225) notes a comparable usage in
Mwotlap <em>na-tqō</em> where fishing activity is banned for a period so
as to allow fish to reproduce. A ban there is signalled by a conspicuous
leaf (e.g. a coconut frond, a cordyline leaf) tied to a stick at the
entrance to the area. <a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens</a> (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">1927</a>:254–5) describes a similar
temporary prohibition on foodstuffs prior to a feast made by a chief in
Sa’a. Here the visible sign is identified as a pole with a bunch of
leaves of the putty nut (_Parinari_um laurinum). In Sa’a, such
non-religious prohibitions are labelled <em>adi</em>, not
<em>abu</em>.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-3"></a></p>
<h3 id="property-protection">3.3. Property protection</h3>
<p>A similar practice is the placing of a taboo sign on a tree or garden
by the owner to prevent theft. It is commonly placed on coconut and
betel palms growing away from the village. Those who steal or trespass
are believed to suffer illness or other misfortune, the result having
been preordained by the owner. The <em>tabu</em> term may refer both to
the ban and to the sign representing it. In Dobu, individuals may own
the right to both impose and lift tabus which have the power to inflict
disease, and are commonly used to protect private property in this way
(<a href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune 1963</a>:138). We also find
mention of the practice in Rotuman where <em>fapu-i</em> serves as a
verb ‘to mark (esp. a coconut palm) as forbidden to others’, and as a
noun ‘a nut or leaf used to mark a tree as forbidden.’</p>
<p>In Herman Melville’s <em>Typee</em>, set in the Marquesas and
published in 1876 is the passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frequently, in walking through the groves I observed breadfruit and
coconut trees with a wreath of leaves twined in a peculiar fashion about
their trunks. This was the mark of the taboo. The trees themselves,
their fruit, and even the shadows they cast upon the ground were
consecrated by their presence. (1876:252, quoted by <a
href="../sources/Handy1923">Handy 1923</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-290"></a></p>
<p>Melville was evidently aware that the ban there was more than just a
prohibition – it carried with it an endowment of sanctity.</p>
<p>In Numfor-Biak, a non-Oceanic Austronesian language, is a term
<em>kābus</em> defined as ‘tree branch or anything else placed on fruit
tree or other object by its owner in order to make others afraid to
approach the marked object lest ill-fortune befall them’. The term is
included in a footnote in<a href="../sources/Blust1995">ACD</a>under
<em>*tapu-tapu</em>, noting that while the initial <em>k-</em>
corresponds to POc <em>*t-</em>, the long vowel and final <em>-s</em>
are unexplained.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-4"></a></p>
<h3 id="place-taboos">3.4. Place taboos</h3>
<p>A taboo may also be placed on a location because it is perceived as
either sacred or dangerous or some combination of both. This may be as
in Tonga where a piece of ground or a house or a grave that has been
visited by a chief and hence regarded as consecrated by a god, becomes
<em>tapu</em>. It may apply in Vanuatu where graveyards and other places
haunted by supernatural forces are to be avoided through fear. <a
href="../sources/Francois2022">François</a> (<a
href="../sources/Francois2022">2022</a>:235) lists Sakao <em>e-tev</em>
‘burial ground, grave’, and Tamambo <em>tambu</em> ‘grave’ as examples.
The only mention of a place-related use of <em>tabu</em> in western
Oceanic languages is in Sursurunga (MM) where <em>tam</em> is defined as
‘a strong taboo, e.g. of a spirit dwelling. It is used in places where
spirits dwell and where punishment is inevitable if violated’.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned prohibitions apply to everyone. Other place
taboos may be applicable only to a specified group. As <a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">Keesing</a> (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1982">1982</a>:65) explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Kwaio men’s house or shrine is <em>abu</em> from the point of view
of those – women, infants, Christians – who are excluded from it; but it
is not <em>abu</em> in and of itself. A woman giving birth is
<em>abu</em>, and so is the women’s latrine, the menstrual hut, the
childbirth shelter – but only in relation to those who cannot enter
them. … What is <em>abu</em> for one person is <em>mola</em> ‘permitted’
for another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt practical, non-sacred prohibitions of this kind exist
throughout the Oceanic world. But nowhere else have we located them
so-labelled. Either these restrictions are thought to be so commonplace
that mentioning is unnecessary, or they are labelled in terms other than
<em>abu</em>.</p>
<p><a id="s-3-5"></a></p>
<h3 id="dehortative">3.5. Dehortative</h3>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, apparent reflexes of <em>*tabu</em>
sometimes occur as a dehortative, probably so that children might learn
early where it applied. It is mentioned as sharing this function in
wordlists from the Admiralties, in Tubetube and several Southeast
Solomonic languages, while François lists it as a Bislama interjection
probably borrowed from Polynesia (2022:219). It is not clear whether
this meaning should be attributed to POc <em>*tabu</em> or if it
developed independently in various daughter languages.</p>
<p><a id="s-4"></a></p>
<h2 id="identifying-the-sacred">4. Identifying the sacred</h2>
<p>There is a difficulty in identifying the degree to which a sense of
sanctity is part of the meaning of <em>tabu</em> as practised in
different communities. Even in Polynesia, <a
href="../sources/Fornander1878">Fornander</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fornander1878">1878</a>:113) recognised a certain
ambivalence in its practice.</p>
<p><a id="p-291"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The religious tabus relating to rites, observances, public worship,
and the maintenance of the gods and their priests, were well known,
comparatively fixed in their character, and the people brought up from
childhood in the knowledge and observance of them. But the civil tabus
were as uncertain and capricious as the mind of the chief, priest or
individual who imposed them on others, or on himself and his family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example of the latter, in Dobu, where taboos are widely used to
protect private property, they are also used in the ordinary course of
private feuds. A man will put a <em>tabu</em> on a woman who has refused
his advances (<a href="../sources/Fortune1963">Fortune
1963</a>:143).</p>
<p>In his detailed examination of taboo terms in Vanuatu, <a
href="../sources/Francois2022">François</a> (<a
href="../sources/Francois2022">2022</a>) finds that although languages
vary in what is identified by the terms as “off-limits, forbidden”,
there is widespread evidence for their meanings to include “sacred, due
to a sentiment of awe and fear before spiritual forces”.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens</a> (<a
href="../sources/Ivens1927">1927</a>:253–5) describes the situation in
Sa’a and neighbouring Ulawa, where there are two terms, <em>apu</em> and
<em>adi</em>, both denoting prohibitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a word <em>apu</em> in both languages which … denotes
something that is forbidden to a person by reason of communal
regulations, e.g. the marriage of cross-cousins, or the following of any
course of action which would result in bodily harm or in bringing on the
ill will of the ghosts, e.g. the rash intrusion into those spheres of
religion which belong to the office of the priest, or the doing of any
thing which would cause a person to be ceremonially defiled, or that
condition of things which follows the imposition of a tabu by the proper
authority. The causative form <em>ha’aapu</em> denotes a state of
prohibition which has as its background the commands either of
constituted authority, or of the local ghosts. (1927:253)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second term, <em>adi</em>, covers prohibitions imposed by the
hereditary chiefs. Prohibitions are largely administered on an ad hoc
basis for limited ends, and contain no ghostly sanctions. The things
which are thus prohibited are “fruit trees, paths, gardens, pigs,
fishing, streams, landing places, personal possessions” (p.253).
<em>adi</em> depends on the position and prestige of the chiefs for its
inviolacy: the action is merely human. <em>apu</em> is carried out with
the accompaniment of religious rites, there is a ghostly sanction
empowering it, and it is immaterial whether the person who invoked it
was a person of importance or not. Any case of infraction of
<em>apu</em> will be followed by sickness.</p>
<p><a href="../sources/Hogbin1934b">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1934b">1934b</a>:261) writes that in Malu’u [=
To’aba’ita], ‘sacred’ rather than ‘forbidden’ is the primary meaning of
the term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ambu</em> is the local form of the Polynesian <em>tapu</em> and
means, primarily, relating to the spirits, and hence, sacred. There are
in addition, several derived meanings, first, set apart; second,
forbidden under penalty of punishment by the spirits; and third,
forbidden under penalty of punishment by man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds (p.262) that since the introduction of Christianity,
<em>ambu</em>, instead of being applied to spirits is now applied to
God.</p>
<p>The sense of ‘sacred’, sometimes linked with ‘holy’ is included in
definitions of reflexes of <em>*tabu</em> from a majority of subgroups.
The implications of this terminology are open to conjecture. The entry
for <em>tapu</em> in Firth’s Tikopia dictionary, for example, includes
both ‘sacred’ and ‘holy’ in its gloss but annotates ‘holy’ as ‘modern’,
suggesting the latter as a Christian addition to the meaning.</p>
<p><a id="p-292"></a></p>
<p><a id="s-5"></a></p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-mana">5. Relationship with <em>mana</em></h2>
<p>A major difference in <em>tabu</em> practices between Eastern and
Western Oceanic societies would appear to lie in the way in which the
authority believed responsible for upholding the prohibitions is viewed.
In Eastern Oceanic the chiefs are believed to derive much of their power
and status from possession of <em>mana</em>. The term exists in
reconstructed form as PEOc <em>*mana</em>, a stative verb ‘to have
supernatural power from ancestral spirits as manifest in successful
outcomes; be efficacious’ and as a noun ‘efficacy, success’ (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-9-2-1">§9.2.1</a>). Particularly in
Polynesia, chiefs, endowed with <em>mana</em>, were regarded as
descended from gods, with powers of life or death and largely held apart
from the rest of the community. This carried an implication of sanctity
on both the chiefs and on whatever they came in contact with, rendering
<em>tapu</em> their person and much associated with them. The
association between <em>mana</em> and <em>tabu</em> is continued in the
Southeast Solomons but the chiefs there are ‘merely human’ in Ivens’
words, with the religious duties mainly overseen by priests.</p>
<p>Evidence of <em>mana</em> is lacking in western Melanesian
communities. <a href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman</a> (<a
href="../sources/Seligman1910">1910</a>:576) writes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither at Wagawaga, Tubetube nor elsewhere in the district does
there seem to be any development of that system of personal influence
(<em>mana</em>) taboo whereby the thing made taboo receives, as it were,
a dynamic charge from contact with an individual, which is dangerous to
everyone not rendered immune by the possession of an equal or greater
power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In western Oceania, some communities are led by hereditary chiefs,
others by big men. But in both kinds of leadership, power is often
shared. In Mekeo, the chief shared his leadership role with the sorcerer
(<a href="../sources/Stephen1987">Stephen 1987</a>), while in Kilivila
the garden magician appeared equally powerful (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1935">Malinowski 1935</a>). Neither
hereditary chiefs nor big men in western Oceania hold the god-like
stature of sacredness and apartness attributable to those in Fiji and
Polynesia, and which accord the latter a special relationship with
<em>mana</em>. In western Oceania it is magic rather than <em>mana</em>
that affects all aspects of life, and magic appears to depend more
heavily on a negative fear of sorcery than a positive awe in the face of
the supernatural for its effectiveness.</p>
<p><a id="s-6"></a></p>
<h2 id="freedom-from-tabu">6. Freedom from <em>tabu</em></h2>
<p>Where a taboo is represented by a physical sign such as a cluster of
leaves on a pole, removal of the taboo is indicated by removal of the
sign. But where no sign exists, as with food or name taboos, an oral
expression is required for its removal. Terms indicating freedom from
taboo may show either that a temporary taboo has been lifted, or simply
that a questioned item is not subject to taboo (and may never have
been), and without context it is not always possible to know which
situation applies. Both PPn <em>*ŋafua</em> ‘be allowed’ and PNPn
<em>*taŋa</em> ‘free from ritual prohibition’ have cognates applicable
to both situations, the shared Samoan and Tikopia terms indicating that
either can apply to remove a restriction.</p>

<h2 id="a-second-taboo-term">7. A second taboo term</h2>
<p>A second term carrying the meaning of taboo, POc <em>*pali</em>
‘ritually restricted or prohibited’, has been reconstructed. It has an
older history than POc <em>*tabu</em>, being reconstructed back to PAn
<em>*paliSi</em> ‘taboo, ritual restriction; purifying rite’ (ACD). Its
scattered Oceanic reflexes from the Admiralties, southeast Solomons and
NC Vanuatu, together with a larger number from Micronesia, are evidence
that it was once widespread, presumably replaced in some languages by
reflexes of <em>*tabu</em>. The Micronesian terms do not suggest a clear
PMic antecedent. Perhaps ‘engage in ceremonial rite’ is preferable to
the gloss offered by Bender et al., 2003. Only Woleaian has reflexes of
both <em>*pali</em> and <em>*tabu</em>, its <em>*tabu</em> reflex
possibly borrowed from Polynesia. We currently lack enough information
to allow us to distinguish the two terms with any certainty, although
<em>*pali</em> differs from <em>*tabu</em> in lacking any sense of
sanctity. We note that Blust glosses POc <em>*pali</em> as ‘taboo’ and
that Paiwan <em>palisi</em> is glossed ‘tabu’ (ACD).</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">8. Conclusions</h2>
<p>There can be little doubt that the primary meaning of POc
<em>*tabu</em> was as a stative verb ‘prohibited, forbidden’ and as a
noun, applicable both to the ban and to the thing banned. Hence POc
<em>*tabu</em> (VSt) ‘prohibited, forbidden’; (N) ‘a ban on some action
or thing; the thing so banned’.</p>
<p>From the collected ethnographic examples, POc <em>*tabu</em> appears
to have had the following applications:</p>
<p><a id="p-295"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>In the preparation and consumption of foodstuffs in particular
circumstances including at times the kin relationship between the
supplier and the consumer (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-3-1">§10.3.1</a>).</li>
<li>Through the safeguarding of food sources by a visible sign either to
guarantee supply (<a href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-3-2">§10.3.2</a>)
or to guard against theft (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-3-3">§10.3.3</a>).</li>
<li>Through the identification of places where people should not go,
either for reasons of safety or sanctity (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-3-4">§10.3.4</a>).</li>
<li>Through use of the term as a dehortative, so that children might
learn early where it is to be applied (<a
href="../contributions/6-10#s-10-3-5">§10.3.5</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>One area in which there is doubt as to its application in POc times
is in the degree to which the tabooed object carries the sense of
untouchable sanctity. The sense of awe and obeisance displayed before
the chiefs in Polynesia and to a lesser extent accompanying the
religious practices in the SE Solomons, and implicit there in
<em>tapu</em>/<em>apu</em> is largely lacking in Western Oceanic, and it
is suggested that this dispersal correlates to some extent with belief
in <em>mana</em>. <em>Tabu</em> in western Oceanic languages appears not
to hold the sense of sanctity unless imposed by Christian influence.</p>
<p>Blust calls the concept “one of the key cultural items in the POc
lexicon, designating a type of social control that was enforced by
supernatural sanctions” (ACD). As described in this chapter it may be
rather more limited in its context.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>William Mariner was a teenage ship’s clerk on the
British privateer Port-au-Prince, who survived when the ship was
attacked and sunk by Tongan warriors off the island of Lifuka in Tonga
in 1806. He was taken under the protection of the king who treated him
as a son. Intelligent and resourceful, and blessed with a keen ear, he
became fluent in the language, and partook of daily life as a member of
the royal household for the next four years. On his return to England he
dictated a book of his experiences to John Martin, which included a
grammar and vocabulary.

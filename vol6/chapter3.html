<h1 class="title">Was Proto Oceanic society matrilineal?</h1>
</header>
<p><a href=".smallcaps">Per Hage</a></p>
<p>Proto Oceanic society is believed to have developed in the region of
the Bismarck Archipelago in western Melanesia around 1500 BC.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Within a few hundred
years daughter societies expanded eastward into the rest of Melanesia
and into nuclear Micronesia, eventually reaching the remotest islands of
Polynesia by 1000 AD (<a href="../sources/Kirch1997">Kirch 1997</a>).<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Lexical reconstruction has revealed
a great deal about Proto Oceanic economy, technology and material
culture [Ross, Pawley and Osmond 1998]<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> but
very little about aspects of social organisation. In particular there is
considerable uncertainty about the type and even the existence of
descent groups. My purpose is to suggest, through a combined analysis of
historical linguistic, ethnographic and cross-cultural data, that POc
society had unilineal, probably matrilineal descent groups and unilocal,
probably matrilocal or matri-avunculocal residence rules.</p>
<p>Conjectures about descent groups in Proto Oceanic [read “early
Oceanic”] society have a long history with contributions by
anthropologists, linguists and archaeologists. <a
href="../sources/Rivers1914">Rivers</a> (<a
href="../sources/Rivers1914">1914</a>) assumed that early Melanesian
society, like all early societies, was matrilineal on the grounds that
only maternal kinship connections could be known for certain. He thought
that matrilineal moiety systems developed early in Melanesian history as
the result of a fusion between indigenous peoples and later arrivals,
and he attributed shifts to patrilineal descent and succession to the
influence of immigrants with an advanced culture. As <a
href="../sources/MAllen1984">M. Allen</a> (<a
href="../sources/MAllen1984">1984</a>:27) observed, Rivers’ argument was
not really refuted, but simply “abandoned as a result of the general
demise of evolutionary anthropology in favour of structural
functionalism”. In a variation of Rivers’ scenario, Allen proposed that
matrilineal descent groups were a precondition of social stratification
in Melanesia, the argument being that that their restrictions on
membership encouraged the formation of larger non-kinship political
groups such as the graded societies of Vanuatu.</p>
<p><a id="p-142"></a></p>
<p>Several decades after Rivers, <a
href="../sources/Murdock1949">Murdock</a> (<a
href="../sources/Murdock1949">1949</a>) concluded from the application
of an evolutionary algorithm that Proto Malayo-Polynesian and Proto
Oceanic society were bilateral or “Hawaiian” in type and lacked descent
groups of any kind. By Hawaiian, Murdock meant a cluster of traits
including generational-Hawaiian kinship terminology, bilateral kindreds
and bilocal extended families as well as the absence of unilineal
descent groups. <a href="../sources/Goodenough1955">Goodenough</a> (<a
href="../sources/Goodenough1955">1955</a>), noting that land tenure is
generally associated with kinship groups in Malayo-Polynesian societies,
amended Murdock’s conclusion by adding to it the feature of cognatic
landholding descent groups. Linguistic evidence in support of Murdock’s
reconstruction was provided by <a href="../sources/Milke1958">Milke</a>
(<a href="../sources/Milke1958">1958</a>) who interpreted the basically
generational-Hawaiian structure of POc kinship terminology, in which M =
MZ = FZ and G = PGC as consistent with a bilateral form of social
organisation.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Evidence against the bilateral
hypothesis was adduced by <a href="../sources/Blust1980a">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust1980a">1980a</a>) and <a
href="../sources/HageandHarary1996">Hage and Harary</a> (<a
href="../sources/HageandHarary1996">1996</a>) who showed that a strict
application of Murdock’s algorithm leads to the conclusion that POc
society was just as likely to have been “Iroquois” in type with either
matrilineal or double descent.</p>
<p>In a recent work, <a href="../sources/Kirch1997">Kirch</a> (<a
href="../sources/Kirch1997">1997</a>) proposed on general ethnographic
grounds, that Lapita, i.e. Proto Oceanic, descent groups were cognatic
in type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social anthropologists have long been aware that Oceanic peoples do
not organize themselves onto strict unilinear descent groups but rather
tend to have more flexible cognatic (sometimes called “ambilinear” or
“non-unilinear”) systems of descent reckoning” (<a
href="../sources/Kirch1997">Kirch 1997</a>:189-90)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it is true that there are many cognatic societies in Oceania,
they do not predominate in all regions and where they do exist, they may
not be a continuation of POc society but, rather, a later
development.</p>
<p>In a linguistic approach to the problem, <a
href="../sources/Pawley1981">Pawley</a> (<a
href="../sources/Pawley1981">1981</a>) reconstructed a POc term
<em>*kainaŋa</em> as meaning ‘descent group’ and, following <a
href="../sources/Goodenough1955">Goodenough</a> (<a
href="../sources/Goodenough1955">1955</a>) as ‘landholding descent
group’ [but see <a href="../contributions/6-3#s-4-2-2">§4.2.2</a>.6].
However, <a href="../sources/Chowning1991">Chowning</a> (<a
href="../sources/Chowning1991">1991</a>) objected that <em>*kainaŋa</em>
may be attributable only to a lower-order branch of the Oceanic family
tree and she argued that even if <em>*kainaŋa</em>, or an equivalent
term <em>*qapusa</em>, could be attributed to POc,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we would have no clue as to what kind of descent group or category
might be represented. For the former, cognate terms designate a
patrilineal group in Tikopia [a Polynesian outlier in Melanesia], a
matrilineal one in Truk [in Micronesia] and a cognatic one in Maori [in
Polynesia]. Furthermore, the kinship terms reconstructed so far for POc
do not solve the problem. If POc had unilinear descent, we would expect
either that a term for cross-cousin was reconstructable, or that many
more of the societies would be like Truk and the Trobriands in having
kinship systems (Crow, in these cases) that group cross-cousins with
other kin types. I would also expect a reconstructable term for FaSi
[father’s sister] unless, as in Kove, she was called by the same term as
MoBro [mother’s brother], but this does not seem to happen in many
Melanesian societies (<a href="../sources/Chowning1991">Chowning
1991</a>:70).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-143"></a></p>
<p>The problem of descent in POc society is not as insoluble as it might
appear. POc kinship terminology (<a href="../sources/Milke1958">Milke
1958</a>), like that of Proto Polynesian (<a
href="../sources/Marck1996">Marck 1996</a>) and Proto Malayo-Polynesian
(<a href="../sources/Blust1980a">Blust 1980a</a>) terminology, was
bifurcate merging for males in the first ascending (+1) generation: F =
FB ≠ MB (POc <em>*tama</em> ‘F, FB’, <em>*matuqa</em> ‘MB’. [See ch. 2
of this volume for a detailed reconstruction of POc kinship terms.] It
is uncertain for all three of these protolanguages whether +1
terminology for females was also bifurcate merging (M = MZ ≠ FZ) or
generational, as <a href="../sources/Milke1958">Milke</a> (<a
href="../sources/Milke1958">1958</a>) thought, but as far as inferences
about descent are concerned it does not matter at all. Nor does it
matter that the POc terminology lacked terms for cross-cousins (PssGC ≠
PosGC) or that Crow type terminologies (FZ = FZD, F = FZS) are not more
common in ethnographically known Oceanic societies. Generalising from an
earlier study by <a href="../sources/Murdock1947">Murdock</a> (<a
href="../sources/Murdock1947">1947</a>), the presence of a term for MB
alone is sufficient to establish that descent in Proto Oceanic, Proto
Polynesian and Proto Malayo-Polynesian society was almost certainly
unilineal.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> As shown in <a
href="#table-3.1">Table 3.1</a>, bifurcate merging terminologies for +1
males in non-unilineal societies are almost always found together with
unilineal descent groups (patrilineal, matrilineal or both) 85 percent
of the time.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The rare cases of bifurcate merging
terminologies in non-unilineal societies are best interpreted as
survivals from earlier unilinear states, under the assumption that
changes in kinship terminology usually follow changes in descent rules
(<a href="../sources/Lowie1948">Lowie 1948</a>; <a
href="../sources/Murdock1949">Murdock 1949</a>; <a
href="../sources/Fox1967">Fox 1967</a>). As shown in <a
href="#table-3.2">Table 3.2</a>, bifurcate merging terminology is also
associated with unilocal residence—91 percent of the time.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
Proto Oceanic society was either patrilineal and patrilocal, or
matrilineal and matrilocal or matri-avunculocal. Using the same cross-
cousin sample as for Tables 3.1 and 3.2, 81 percent of the matrilineal
societies are either matrilocal or avunculocal.</p>

<p>The evidence for matrilineal rather than patrilineal descent in Proto
Oceanic society is distributional, linguistic and historical in nature.
As <a href="../sources/Rivers1914">Rivers</a> (<a
href="../sources/Rivers1914">1914</a>) and <a
href="../sources/MAllen1984">M. Allen</a> (<a
href="../sources/MAllen1984">1984</a>) emphasised, matrilineal descent
groups are found extensively in many areas of Melanesia including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Huon Gulf, New Britain [east of the Willaumez Peninsula] and New
Ireland [in the Bismarck Archipelago], the Massim Archipelago [apart
from the northern d’Entrecasteaux], Bougainville, parts of the Solomons
and much of north and central Vanuatu (<a
href="../sources/MAllen1984">M. Allen 1984</a>:26). [Brackets are
Hage’s]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Double descent groups are also found in Melanesia, e.g. Bunlap [Sa,
south Pentecost] (<a href="../sources/Tattevin1928">Tattevin 1928</a>),
Vanua Levu [Fiji] (<a href="../sources/Quain1948">Quain 1948</a>) and
also in Micronesia, e.g. Pingelap (<a href="../sources/Damas1979">Damas
1979</a>) and in Polynesia in Pukapuka (<a
href="../sources/BeagleholeandBeaglehole1938">Beaglehole and Beaglehole
1938</a>). If <a href="../sources/Murdock1940">Murdock</a> (<a
href="../sources/Murdock1940">1940</a>, <a
href="../sources/Murdock1949">1949</a>) was right, one of the origins of
double descent is the intrusion of patrilineal institutions into a
strongly integrated matrilineal system. In a survey of double descent
systems Murdock found that exogamy is everywhere associated with both
matrilineal and patrilineal groups, but that inheritance and succession
are almost always patrilineal. Residence is always patrilocal and
political organisation is patrilineal.</p>
<p>In <a href="#table-3.4">Table 3.4</a>, all the Oceanic-speaking
societies in the WEA are classified by type of descent group. In
Polynesia, the last region of Oceanic settlement, descent groups are
almost entirely cognatic; in nuclear Micronesia they are almost entirely
matrilineal; and in Island Melanesia,<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
the homeland of Proto Oceanic society, they are predominantly
matrilineal or formerly matrilineal, as attested by systems of double
descent.</p>

<p>With a larger sample of societies, the rows in <a
href="#table-3.4">Table 3.4</a> could specify major subgroups of the
Oceanic language family. On the basis of available data in the WEA,
matrilineal and double descent are not confined to societies in any one
subgroup. It must be noted that anthropologists are sometimes uncertain
about the existence of double descent, Thus Hogbin changed his mind
about double descent in Wogeo, referring in 1970 to matrilineal moieties
and agnatic residential groups. <a
href="../sources/Schneider1984">Schneider</a> (<a
href="../sources/Schneider1984">1984</a>) changed his earlier view of
Yap (<a href="../sources/Schneider1961">Schneider 1961</a>) when he,
most unfortunately, came to reject the entire metalanguage of kinship
analysis.</p>
<p>Historical linguistic evidence for matrilineal descent in Proto
Oceanic society is provided by <a
href="../sources/Blust198687">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust198687">1986-87</a>) whose argument may be
summarised. In the Austronesian languages terms for ‘orphan’ are in some
cases monomorphemic as in Bontok so ‘be an orphan’ but in other cases
descriptive as Malay <em>anak piatu</em> (<em>anak</em> ‘child,
<em>piatu</em> ‘desolate, orphaned’). In some Oceanic languages the
descriptive term refers to one or both parents. In a sample of 12
Oceanic languages, Blust found that in eight languages there is an
agreement between the parent mentioned in the descriptive term and the
rule of descent. For example, in Ere ‘orphan’ is timan <em>pwi</em>
‘father none’ and descent is patrilineal; in Woleaian ‘orphan’ is
<em>sile-mas</em> and descent is matrilineal; in Samoan ‘orphan’ is
<em>matua-oti</em> ‘parents dead’ and descent is ambilineal (cognatic).
This correlation suggests that in Austronesian societies an orphan is
defined in relation to his/her descent group rather than his/her
parents. The four exceptions are Kwara’ae, Lau, ’Are’are and Sa’a, all
of which are spoken in patrilineal societies in Malaita in the southeast
Solomons. In all four languages there is a pair of terms reflecting
Proto Malaita-Cristobal <em>*tina mate</em> ‘mother dead; and <em>*tina
mauri</em> ‘mother living’ which refer to both parents, or to the father
alone, and to persons of high and low status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that a paired term reflecting earlier <em>*tina
mauri</em> (“mother living”) is found widely in the Southeast Solomons
(but not in Micronesia). Compare LAU (C.E. <a
href="../sources/Fox1974">Fox 1974</a>) <em>inamae</em>/<em>inomae</em>
‘orphan, relatives dead, poor and unprotected’,
<em>inamauri</em>/<em>inomauri</em> ‘parents alive, prosperous,
important’, <em>inamouri</em> ‘eldest son of a living chief’; (Catherine
Tyhurst, pers. comm.) <em>inomae</em> ‘eldest son of a deceased man’,
<em>faa-inomae</em> ‘to bereave’.—‘ARE’ARE (<a
href="../sources/Geerts1970">Geerts 1970</a>) <em>inamae</em> ‘orphan’,
<em>inamauri</em> ‘a very big chief, a person of very great
importance’.—SA’A (<a href="../sources/Ivens1929">Ivens 1929</a>[a])
<em>inemae</em> ‘be an orphan, be bereft of parents, an orphan’,
<em>inemauri</em> ‘be a chief, have a due succession of chiefs, a
chief’.—AROSI (C.E. <a href="../sources/Fox1970">Fox 1970</a>)
<em>inemae</em> ‘child whose mother is dead, orphan’, <em>inemauri</em>
‘child whose mother is living’ (<a href="../sources/Blust198687">Blust
1986-87</a>:220).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-147"></a></p>
<p>Blust interprets the discrepancy between the proto-term for ‘orphan’,
and its reflexes as evidence for a shift from matrilineal to patrilineal
descent in Malaita and by implication in the “wider Oceanic context”.
Under this interpretation the correlation between lexical glosses of
terms for ‘orphan’ and rules of descent in his sample of
Oceanic-speaking societies is “exceptionless”.</p>
<p>Specific historical evidence in favour of Rivers’ matrilineal
hypothesis was adduced by <a href="../sources/Lane1961">Lane</a> (<a
href="../sources/Lane1961">1961</a>). Using kinship data collected by
different observers over a period of nearly 100 years, Lane described
the breakdown of matrilineal social organisation in two Vanuatu
societies, Mota in the Banks Islands and Barabet in Pentecost.
Matrilineal clan and moiety organisation was weakened or disappeared,
residence (in Barabet) became bilocal and Crow kinship terminologies
[cf. <a href="../contributions/6-3#s-2-3-3">§2.3.3</a>], which are
usually associated with matrilineal descent, gave way to modified
generational Hawaiian terminologies [cf. <a
href="../contributions/6-3#s-2-3-1">§2.3.1</a>]. Lane attributes these
changes to the effects of sudden and extensive depopulation which
fatally weakens more rigid lineage systems and moves them in the
direction of more flexible bilateral systems. Generalising this result,
Lane, following <a href="../sources/Dole1967">Dole</a> (<a
href="../sources/Dole1967">1967</a>), concluded that the bilateral
organisation of Polynesian, especially eastern Polynesian, societies
developed in response to the difficulties faced by small unstable
populations settling widely separated islands.</p>
<p>Kinship systems are generally conservative in nature: they change
slowly, sometimes glacially, under normal (non-acculturative)
circumstances, and they are more resistant to diffusion than other
cultural traits (<a href="../sources/DyenandAberle1974">Dyen and Aberle
1974</a>; <a href="../sources/Eggan1955">Eggan 1955</a>; <a
href="../sources/Murdock1949">Murdock 1949</a>). If Proto Oceanic
society was, in fact, matrilineal then one might expect a continuation
of matrilineal traits in its descendants. The converse would be true if
Proto Oceanic society was patrilineal. Data for testing this hypothesis
come from a recent study by Burton, Moore, Whiting and Romney
(1996).</p>
<p>Burton and his colleagues, building on the work of <a
href="../sources/Murdock1967">Murdock</a> (<a
href="../sources/Murdock1967">1967</a>), have shown that nine world
regions can be distinctively characterised by two dimensions of social
structure: gender and descent. These two dimensions score 63 different
traits of social structure.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The first dimension
contrasts matricentric and patricentric traits of social organisation
and kinship terminology.</p>
<p>In order of strength from highly to weakly positive,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[m]atricentric social organization traits include matrilocal or
uxorilocal residence, monogamy, and the absence of marriage exchange.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Hence, matricentric societies tend
to organize kinship groups around women through matrilocal or uxorilocal
residence or through matrilineal kinship groups (<a
href="../sources/Burtonetal1996">Burton et al. 1996</a>:93)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-148"></a></p>
<p>In order of strength,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[p]atricentric social organization traits include nomadic or
seminomadic settlement patterns, clan communities, localized or
dispersed patrilineal groups, patrilocal residence, polygyny, and
bridewealth payments. Hence, patricentic societies tend to organize kin
groups around men through patrilocal residence, patrilineal descent or
polygyny… Strongly matricentric kinship terminologies include
generational aunt terms, bifurcate merging aunt terms and Crow cousin
terms. The former two terminologies classify mother and mother’s sister
together, as one would expect of societies that keep related women
together after marriage, and Crow cousin terms are well known to be
associated with matrilineal descent. Strongly patricentric kinship
terminologies include bifurcate collateral aunt terms and Omaha cousin
terms. Bifurcate collateral terminologies assign separate terms to
mother and mother’s sister, as one would expect of societies that
separate women after marriage, and Omaha terms are well known to be
associated with patrilineal descent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second dimension…contrasts unilineal and bilateral traits…
Unilineal social organization traits include clan communities, dispersed
or localized patrilineal groups, dispersed matrilineal groups,
patrilocal residence, nonsororal polygyny, cousin marriage, patrilocal
residence, and bridewealth payments. Bilateral social organization
traits include bilateral kin groups, ego-centered kindreds, virilocal
residence, bilocal residence, monogamy, and prohibition of cousin
marriages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Applying the method of correspondence analysis (<a
href="../sources/Greenacre1984">Greenacre 1984</a>) these two dimensions
define a space in which societies can be located by their social
structural traits. Halves of this space are matricentric versus
patricentric and unilineal versus bilateral, while quadrants are
matricentric and bilateral versus matricentric and unilineal, and so on.
Two of the nine world regions identified by Burton et al. are the
Southeast Asia and the Insular Pacific (Micronesia and Polynesia)
region, which is matricentric, and the Australia, New Guinea and
Melanesia region, which is unilineal. Since the authors give the rating
on each dimension for every society in their world-wide sample, it is
possible to define a region strictly by language group. We will consider
only the Oceanic-speaking societies in Polynesia, Nuclear Micronesia and
Melanesia, cross-cutting the two worlds just mentioned.</p>
<p>If Proto Oceanic society was strongly matrilineal, one would expect
to find a continuation of matricentric traits in its descendants,
including those that later developed different descent rules. Support
for this hypothesis is given in <a href="#fig-6-3_1">Figure 3.1</a>.
With two exceptions (Seniang [Sinesip] and Lau, Fiji) all the
Oceanic-speaking societies in the WEA are matricentric whatever their
rule of descent—cognatic, patrilineal, matrilineal or double
descent.</p>

<p>We conclude, on the basis of historical-linguistic, ethnographic and
cross-cultural evidence, that descent in Proto Oceanic society was
matrilineal and residence matrilocal or matri-avunculocal. This result
would account for certain unusual ethnographic facts, such as the
presence of Crow kinship terminology and patrilineal descent in Seniang
[Sinesip] (a case in which changes in kinship terminology, as usual, lag
behind changes in descent), marriage with the MBW (<a
href="../sources/Rivers1914">Rivers 1914</a>) (a practice commonly found
in matrilineal societies of generalised exchange; Lévi-Strauss 1969, <a
href="../sources/Hage1998b">Hage 1998b</a>), and double descent (the
undermining of a strongly integrated matrilineal system by patrilineal
institutions).</p>
<p>It may be, as <a href="../sources/Lane1961">Lane</a> (<a
href="../sources/Lane1961">1961</a>) and <a
href="../sources/Dole1967">Dole</a> (<a
href="../sources/Dole1967">1967</a>) have argued, that demographic and
geographic constraints—small unstable populations and great
distances—led to the development of more flexible cognatic social
organisation in the settlement of Polynesia. It may also be the case
that relative isolation after settlement led to the weakening or
disappearance of matrilineal descent in some Oceanic societies. As
Lévi-Strauss (1984:183) observed with respect to Micronesia, in those
societies that have lived in relative isolation, “we find…a retreat from
matrilineal institutions: left to themselves these institutions, by
reason of their well-known instability, have a tendency to evolve
spontaneously towards other forms.” <a
href="../sources/Damas1979">Damas</a> (<a
href="../sources/Damas1979">1979</a>) makes this point with respect to
isolated atolls in the Carolines—Pingelap, Mokil and Ngatik—where
matrilineal descent was left with few functions other than exogamy:</p>
<p><a id="p-150"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would argue that the comparative vitality of matrilineal emphasis
in the Yap and Truk districts is closely related to regular
reinforcement of those ties through the process of clientship, trade
relations, and (in the case of Yap) a system of tribute which operated
largely within a matrilineal context. By contrast, relative isolation of
the atolls and islands in the eastern Carolines appears to have promoted
conditions which serve to weaken matriliny (<a
href="../sources/Damas1979">Damas 1979</a>:192).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One should also mention here the two isolated outliers, Enewetok and
Ujelang, in the solidly matrilineal Marshall Islands which evolved
patrilineal descent groups (moieties) (<a
href="../sources/HageandHarary1996">Hage and Harary 1996</a>). According
to Ann Chowning (pers. comm.) the majority of Oceanic-speaking societies
in the New Guinea mainland are patrilineal rather than matrilineal. In
this case, rugged terrain rather than geographical distance was a
barrier to social communication which led to the weakening or
disappearance of matrilineal institutions.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of matrilineal Proto Oceanic social organisation
should have interesting culture historical implications. Rivers, as
mentioned, attributed moiety systems, which are common in Melanesia, to
the fusion of indigenous and immigrant peoples. As evidence he noted the
presence of inter-moiety hostility, native traditions of separate
origins and the attribution of physical and mental differences to
members of different moieties. As <a
href="../sources/Blust1981c">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust1981c">1981c</a>) has observed, there is no
linguistic evidence for the “fusion hypothesis”, i.e., no significant
differences in vocabulary, phonology or grammar between members of
different moieties in Oceanic societies. An alternative, more plausible
explanation, which applies to moiety systems in general, derives from a
theory of Murdock’s (1940, 1949). Typically, when a matrilineal society
fissions, the new community, in order to preserve the proximity of males
to their natal groups, consists of two exogamous lineages. Eventually
these two groups may develop onto a moiety system with all its attendant
symbolism. Could such a process account for the prevalence of moiety
systems in Melanesia?<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

<li id="fn12"><p>The great majority of Oceanic-speaking societies in
Melanesia are in Island Melanesia and are the only ones included in the
WEA. In the Encyclopedia of World Cultures, vol. 2, Oceania, [Hays 1991]
five mainland New Guinea Oceanic-speaking societies are represented:
four (Mekeo, Motu, Maisin and Sio) are patrilineal and one (Wamira [=
Bartle Bay dialect of Wedau]) is matrilineal. In distinguishing Oceanic
from non-Austronesian-speaking societies in Melanesia one should not
overlook the effects of interaction between these groups, as <a

studies. In cultural anthropology, Chowning (pers. comm.) notes an
interesting historical connection between them: “At least in East New
Britain and on Bougainville, the [non-Austronesian]-speaking societies,
whose ancestors presumably arrived there long before the [Oceanic]
speakers, are also matrilineal… [I]n the matrilineal arc that extends
from the Massim up through Bougainville and across to New Britain,
matrilinearity, regardless of language affiliation, is associated with
the belief that the lines in the palms of the hands designate the bird
tabu to the descent group.” See <a

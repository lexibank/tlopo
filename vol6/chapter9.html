<h2 id="introduction1">1. Introduction<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>
<p>Attempts to trace the etymology of the Oceanic concept of
<em>mana</em> have been undertaken by various linguists and
anthropologists since <a href="../sources/Capell193839">Capell</a> (<a
href="../sources/Capell193839">1938-39</a>) including <a
href="../sources/Blust2007">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust2007">2007</a>) and <a
href="../sources/Blevins2008">Blevins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blevins2008">2008</a>). A Proto Eastern Oceanic
reconstruction <em>*mana</em> (VSt) ‘to have supernatural power from
ancestral spirits as manifest in successful outcomes; be efficacious’;
(N) ‘efficacy, success’, is well supported, but to raise it to POc we
need either cognates from Oceanic languages outside the Eastern Oceanic
subgroup<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> or from Austronesian languages
external to Oceanic. A few questionable cognates in the MM and PT
linkages of Western Oceanic have either markedly different meanings or
are in languages where the possibility of borrowing is high. Both Blust
and Blevins propose POc reconstructions, in each case attributing a
divergent meaning to the POc etymon, but both sets of evidence are
problematic. I will begin by reviewing the evidence for a PEOc
reconstruction, before discussing possible WOc cognates. Blust’s
argument for a POc origin that includes power from natural events
including wind and thunder will be considered, followed by that of
Blevins who, like Capell, looks for an origin outside Oceanic.</p>

<h2 id="the-mana-concept-in-proto-eastern-oceanic">2. The <em>*mana</em>
concept in Proto Eastern Oceanic</h2>
<p><a id="p-270"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the first person to bring the concept of <em>mana</em> to
anthropological discourse was Robert Codrington, a
missionary-anthropologist whose 1891 book, <em>The Melanesians</em>, was
based on his fieldwork in the southeast Solomons and the Banks Islands
of northern Vanuatu<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He described the concept as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a supernatural power or influence, called almost universally
<em>mana</em>. This is what works to effect everything which is beyond
the ordinary power of men, outside the common processes of nature; it is
present in the atmosphere of life, attaches itself to persons and
things, and is manifested by results which can only be ascribed to its
operation. (<a href="../sources/Codrington1891">Codrington
1891</a>:118)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept was recognised early as of particular importance in Fiji
and Polynesia, where hereditary chiefs were believed to derive much of
their power and status from possession of <em>mana</em> (<a
href="../sources/Firth1940">Firth 1940</a>:488, <a
href="../sources/Sahlins1962">Sahlins 1962</a>:319). Robert <a
href="../sources/Williamson1937">Williamson</a> (<a
href="../sources/Williamson1937">1937</a>:110), a social anthropologist
with a particular interest in the religious beliefs and social
organisation of Polynesians, argued that from a broad Polynesian
perspective its primary meaning seems to have been ‘effective’, with the
general implication that the efficacy so imputed went beyond that
encountered in everyday life. His view was accepted by Capell (1938–39)
who was, however, more concerned by the word’s etymology than its exact
meaning.</p>
<p>Firth, writing of the belief as understood in Tikopia, agreed with
Williamson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A possible translation of <em>manu</em><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or
<em>mana</em> in Tikopia would … appear to be ‘success’ or ‘successful’,
which can embody reference both to the ability of man and to tangible
results. …. Another possible translation of <em>manu</em> is ‘efficacy’
or ‘to be efficacious’. Here the emphasis again is on the fact that the
activity works, that it performs the function for which it was intended.
But since the efficacy is believed to be only partly due to human
endeavour, any translation must also by implication embody a reference
to the extra-human causes of the result. (<a
href="../sources/Firth1940">Firth 1940</a>:506)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also noted (p.497–8) that “to the Tikopia, <em>manu</em>, I am
sure has not the connotation of an isolatable principle, a power, or any
other metaphysical abstraction – though it may be conceived of as a
specific quality.”</p>
<p>Ian Hogbin, who did fieldwork in several different societies of
Melanesia, recognised the concept represented in metathesised form in
To’aba’ita in the southeast Solomons. He wrote (1936:245) “to have
<em>nanama</em> means to be successful through the favour of the
spirits”, and added later (p.257), “Magic is not supposed to achieve its
end directly. It coerces the spirits to do the work by means of their
<em>nanama</em>.”</p>
<p>In 1984, Roger Keesing, an anthropologist whose fieldwork was with
the Kwaio of the southeast Solomons, published a substantial critique of
the previous literature on <em>mana</em>. Believing that the concept was
probably traceable back to POc, but concerned with its interpretation
rather than its etymology, he described <em>mana</em> as “a condition,
not a ‘thing’, a state inferred retrospectively from the outcome of
events” (1984:137). He considered that the concept he was familiar with
was primarily verbal rather than the nominal form more common in
Polynesia.</p>
<p><a id="p-271"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mana</em> is … in Oceanic languages canonically a stative verb,
not a noun: things and human enterprises and efforts are <em>mana</em>.
<em>Mana</em> is used as a transitive verb as well: ancestors and gods
<em>mana</em>-ize people and their efforts. Where <em>mana</em> is used
as a noun, it is (usually) not as a substantive but as an abstract
verbal-noun denoting the state or quality of <em>mana</em>-ness (of a
thing or act) or being-<em>mana</em> (of a person). Things that are
<em>mana</em> are efficacious, potent, successful, true, fulfilled,
realized; they “work”. <em>Mana</em>-ness is a state of efficacy,
success, truth, potency, blessing, luck, realization—an abstract state
or quality, not an invisible spiritual substance or medium. (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">Keesing 1984</a>:138)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is broad agreement that <em>mana</em> as identified in the
southeast Solomons, northern Vanuatu, Micronesia, Fiji and Polynesia has
a common core of meaning to do with effectiveness in results and power
beyond the ordinary power of men and is well supported both as a stative
verb and noun for Proto Eastern Oceanic.</p>

Looking for corresponding terms in northwest Melanesia</h2>
<p>The number of cognates from Polynesia, Fiji, Micronesia and parts of
the Solomons with consistency of meaning point to a significant and
widespread cultural concept. It was consequently difficult for
ethnographers to believe that it was not part of some earlier belief
system. But, oddly, the concept itself did not seem to be a part of the
underlying belief in magic or supernatural power held in societies
speaking languages from northwest Melanesia. Success in magic in these
communities is believed to come from the correct performance of a spell
and associated ritual (see <a
href="../contributions/6-9#s-8-2-1">§8.2.1</a>), and does not depend on
the intervention of some other quality. Early ethnographers searched in
vain for the Eastern Oceanic concept in Western Oceanic. As early as
1910, Seligman observed of the southern Massim region of southeast New
Guinea that:</p>
<p><a id="p-274"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither at Wagawaga, Tubetube nor elsewhere in the district does
there seem to be any development of that system of personal influence
(<em>mana</em>) taboo whereby the thing made taboo receives, as it were,
a dynamic charge from contact with an individual, which is dangerous to
everyone not rendered immune by the possession of an equal or greater
power. (<a href="../sources/Seligman1910">Seligman 1910</a>:576)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../sources/Hogbin1936">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1936">1936</a>:268), after dealing at some length
with the concept in Longgu and To’aba’ita, pointed out that no such
notion could be identified at Wogeo (NNG) or the Polynesian outlier of
Ontong Java [Luangiua]. Rather, in both of these societies, magic
appeared alone to do many of the functions that <em>mana</em> served
elsewhere. He expressed the same idea in <a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1970">1970</a>:171), when he contrasted beliefs
held in Wogeo, where people use magic directly to achieve effect, with
those in the Solomons and places further east where people achieve
results second hand through application of a special power,
<em>mana</em>.</p>
<p>Malinowski, who worked in S.E. Papua, chiefly the Trobriands,
i.e. places where the concept did not exist, agreed with Hogbin, noting
that Codrington’s assumption that what the latter described was
applicable to the whole of Melanesia could no longer be supported. He
described Codrington’s description of <em>mana</em> as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>almost the exact opposite of the magical virtue as found embodied in
the mythology of savages. … If the virtue of magic is exclusively
localised in man, can be wielded by him only under very special
conditions and in a traditionally prescribed manner, it certainly is not
a force as described by Dr Codrington … The real virtue of magic<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> as I know it from Melanesia is fixed
only in the spell and its rite, and cannot be ‘conveyed in’ anything but
can be conveyed only by its strictly defined procedure. (<a
href="../sources/Malinowski1948">Malinowski 1948</a>:57)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="s-3-1"></a></p>
<h3 id="tubetube-namʷa-namʷa">3.1. Tubetube <em>namʷa-namʷa</em></h3>
<p>After searching widely for cognates in northwest Melanesia, <a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">Keesing</a> (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">1984</a>:147) wrote “I have found only one
probable <em>mana</em> cognate among Oceanic languages west of the
Solomons”, namely Tubetube <em>namwa-namwa</em> in the Papuan Tip.
Notwithstanding Seligman’s evidence that there is no evidence of
<em>mana</em> [in its EOc sense] at Tubetube, Keesing reported the
following personal communication from Martha Macintyre: “A Tubetube folk
healer [told Macintyre]: “<em>namwanamwa ne nima-gu</em> (my hands are
mana).” Keesing was aware, almost at the same time, of a parallel
example from an ethnographer in the Lau islands of Fiji, where a folk
healer is quoted as saying “<em>sa mana liga-qu</em>” (my hands are
mana).</p>
<p>To Keesing, this was incontrovertable evidence that the two concepts
were identical, providing the necessary evidence for a POc
reconstruction parallel to that for PEOc. The highly detailed Tubetube
gloss produced on the basis of these examples – ‘be efficacious, work,
be good, be true, have positive qualities, fulfil potential (that is, of
an animate or inanimate entity, to manifest qualities appropriate to
one’s nature)’ – presumably comes from Keesing himself, acutely aware of
the detailed meanings of mana terms in the SE Solomons.</p>
<p><a id="p-275"></a></p>
<p>However, the regular translation of <em>namʷa-namʷa</em> in Tubetube
is ‘good’ (<a href="../sources/Lithgow1987">Lithgow 1987</a>). Why
Martha Macintyre chose to translate <em>namʷa-namʷa</em> as ‘mana’ is
unknown. Furthermore, although metathesised and partly-reduplicated
examples of <em>mana</em> are accepted as cognate in a number of SE
Solomonic languages (<em>nanama</em> in Longgu, Kwaio and Sa’a,
<em>mamana</em> in Lau and To’aba’ita), the Tubetube term has
<em>mʷ</em> rather than expected <em>m</em>, so the correspondence with
EOc <em>mana</em> is doubly irregular. On these grounds
<em>namʷa-namʷa</em> cannot be accepted as cognate with the reflexes of
PEOc <em>*mana</em>. The Tubetube term is cognate with other Central
Papuan terms reflecting Proto Central Papuan <em>*namʷa</em> ‘good’.</p>

<h3 id="possible-cognates-from-the-northwest-solomons">3.2. Possible
cognates from the Northwest Solomons</h3>
<p>A small cluster of languages in north Bougainville, Halia, Teop and
nearby Nehan, have apparent reflexes of PEOc <em>*mana</em> meaning
‘true’ or ‘truth’, a concept that is included among the wider meanings
of <em>mana</em> terms in the SE Solomons and Wayan Fijian. It is a
logical loosening of meaning from ‘become true, be realised’, as in
Wayan and other languages. In effect, <em>mana</em> in these three
languages denotes an inherent quality, rather than a quality validated
only by results. This could mean either a) that north Bougainville
languages originally had the result-dependent term but loosened its
meaning, b) that they borrowed just one element of its meaning from SES
languages, or c) that the terms are unrelated.</p>

<p>In the sense of ‘becoming true’ <em>mana</em> may be linked to its
use in invocations to the gods as noted in the closely related languages
of Simbo and Roviana, in parts of the SE Solomons, and in Fiji. <a
href="../sources/Waterhouse1949">Waterhouse</a> (<a
href="../sources/Waterhouse1949">1949</a>:150) writes that in Roviana
<em>mana tu</em> is used in invocation, as when placing offerings for
<em>tomate</em> [those to whom sacrifice is made]. In Ulawa <em>mana i
eu dili</em> appears in a variety of invocations (translation not given)
(<a href="../sources/Ivens1927">Ivens 1927</a>:330, 331, 338, 339). <a
href="../sources/Hogbin1936">Hogbin</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hogbin1936">1936</a>:261–3) writes that in To’aba’ita,
sacrifices ensure the continuance of <em>mamanaa</em>. He quotes a spell
that ends with <em>Oke mama-mamana</em> which he translates as “Make
this magic effective through the operation of your <em>mamanaa</em>.” He
adds that it “is a sort of tag used regularly as a conclusion.” <a
href="../sources/Hocart1914">Hocart</a> (<a
href="../sources/Hocart1914">1914</a>:98), who worked in Fiji early in
the century after doing research in Simbo, was struck by similar
invocatory usage (‘let it be so!’) in Simbo/Roviana and Fiji,</p>
<p><a id="p-276"></a></p>
<p>He wrote: 275</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fijians [like Simboese] … do not distinguish ‘true’ and ‘right’. Says
one informant: “if it is true (<em>ndina</em>) it is <em>mana</em>: if
it is not true, it is not <em>mana</em>. … A Fijian medicine does
<em>mana</em> if it works; it does not <em>mana</em> if it does not
work”. In fact, the words are almost interchangeable, and natives will
speak of a sacred stone as <em>mana</em> or <em>ndina</em> (‘true’). …
In winding up a prayer the words <em>mana</em> and <em>ndina</em> are
always coupled: “<em>mana ee i ndina</em>” (“let it be <em>mana</em>,
let it be true”) is the Fijian ‘Amen’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blust suggests (2007:409) that the reference that <em>mana</em>
refers to something true or coming to pass in both Fiji and the Solomons
“may be a post-Christian usage that derives from the characteristics of
scriptural translation, where the fulfillment of prophesies was
described as an expression of divine <em>mana</em>”. However, its
inclusion in the performance of sacrifices in Roviana and To’aba’ita, in
untranslated exhortations from Ulawa and in <a
href="../sources/Hazlewood1850">Hazlewood’s 1850</a> Fijian dictionary
where <em>mana</em> as a verb is described as “a word used when
addressing a heathen deity: so be it, let it be so”, point to an early
pre-Christian usage.</p>
<p>A cluster of terms from languages including Simbo/Roviana spoken in
Choiseul/New Georgia in the north-west Solomons show further promise as
reflexes. For comparison we add geographically close SES terms:</p>

<p>In dismissing evidence that thunder is identified with <em>mana</em>
‘supernatural power’ in NCV languages, we are left with Polynesian terms

languages, while another partly overlapping group includes <em>mana</em>

<p>As both meanings are attributable to the same PPn form, either the
two concepts are related or they are homophones. Blust believes the
former, i.e. that it is part of the human condition that people readily
conceive of powerful forces of nature as carrying within them some
unseen supernatural agency and that thunder here is basically a
representation of supernatural power.</p>
<p>He looked further afield in search of <em>mana</em> cognates that are
associated with powerful forces of nature, and found possible candidates
in terms for wind in languages of the Papuan Tip.</p>
<p><a id="s-4-2"></a></p>
<h3 id="mana-wind">4.2. <em>mana</em> ‘wind’</h3>
<p>In a number of Papuan Tip languages including Dobu, Tubetube, Saliba
and Misima, <em>mana</em> means ‘wind’. In attempting to strengthen the
suggestion that wind might also be seen as an example of power in
natural phenomena, Blust sought evidence that a number of <em>mana</em>
terms in Papuan Tip languages referred particularly to powerful winds
(pp415–6). He includes a reference from <a
href="../sources/JennessandBallantyne1928">Jenness and Ballantyne</a>
(<a href="../sources/JennessandBallantyne1928">1928</a>) that Bwaidoga
<em>mala</em> ‘wind, weather, time of day’ often carries with it the
notion of a supernatural force that manifests itself in the weather.
However, Bwaidoga <em>mala</em> does not reflect PPT <em>*mana</em>.
Along with Kukuya <em>mana</em> ‘time, weather’ and Tawala <em>mala</em>
‘time’, it reflects PPT <em>*ma(r,R)a</em> ‘time, weather’.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Blust also suggested a similar connection between <em>mana</em> and
powerful wind in Micronesia by proposing Satawalese <em>mana-man</em>
‘typhoon’ as cognate with <em>mana</em>. But the Satawalese term is a
reflex of POc <em>*mal(i,e)u</em> ‘wind’<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> (<a

‘cyclone’ and possibly also POc <em>*jaŋi</em> ‘strong wind’ (<a

suggestive of power. Without these examples there is no evidence that
<em>mana</em> is associated with winds of greater consequence and thus
an appropriate representation of supernatural power.</p>

<p>A number of comparisons Blevins makes with terms from Western Oceanic
are, however, problematic. Madak <em>manman</em> ‘wind’ can be rejected
as cognate; it is a reflex of POc <em>*mal(i,e)u</em> ‘wind’ (<a
href="../contributions/2-5#p-124">vol.2:124</a>). Ramoaaina
<em>mamane</em> ‘lightning’ is questionable in both form and meaning. A
small cluster of north Bougainville terms, Halia <em>namname</em> ‘human
spirit, soul, shadow’, Haku <em>name-name</em> ‘spirit, soul’ and Petats
<em>nam-name</em> ‘soul’ appear semantically too distant to be linked.
For our unease about Tubetube <em>namʷa-namʷa</em> see <a
href="../contributions/6-9#s-9-3-1">§9.3.1</a>.</p>
<p>Blevins considers that the strongest arguments for the existence of a
POc ancestor to the Eastern Oceanic <em>mana</em> terms lie in locating
possible cognates in Austronesian languages external to Oceania. She
identifies a link between a possible cognate in a Celebic language of
the Kaili-Pamona group, Bare’e <em>mana</em>, and those in three
Southeast Solomonic languages, Gela, To’aba’ita and Kwaio, where glosses
share a reference to ancestrally conferred power. As a result she
revises and expands the ACD’s entry of Proto Western Malayo-Polynesian
<em>*mana</em> ‘inherit, inheritance’ to PWMP <em>*mana(q)</em><a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> ‘inherit(ance) from ancestors’
(p262). However, of the fourteen possible WMP reflexes Blevins lists,
only Bare’e <em>mana</em> ‘inheritance, heritage; inherited position or
rank, quality of spirit or body that one has from one’s forebears’,
includes spiritual qualities as inheritable. The other WMP terms, if the
sources go beyond a minimal gloss of ‘inheritance’ to spell out what is
included, refer to property, wealth, heirlooms.</p>
<p>For comparison, the glosses quoted by Blevins for the three Southeast
Solomonic languages are given here. They are from <a
href="../sources/Fox1955">Fox</a> (<a
href="../sources/Fox1955">1955</a>) for Gela and as quoted by <a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">Keesing</a> (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">1984</a>:141) for the other two. It is
noteworthy that neither corresponding entries in Lichtenberk’s
To’aba’ita dictionary (2008) and Keesing’s Kwaio dictionary (1975)
mention ancestrally conferred power.</p>

<p>Capell in fact had included the Bare’e term as a possible cognate,
presumably because he saw <em>mana</em> linked with hereditary rank as
in Polynesian societies. However, as <a
href="../sources/Blust2007">Blust</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blust2007">2007</a>:409) notes, no connection between
<em>mana</em> and hereditary rank that could justify its inclusion at
POc level has been demonstrated. In this he is supported by Ann
Chowning, an anthropologist whose fieldwork spanned all three Western
Oceanic subgroups. She wrote (1991:64) while considering evidence for
hereditary leadership “that we have no linguistic evidence [from Western
Oceanic] that POc society had a concept called <em>mana</em> that
pertained either to gods and spirits, or to primogeniture.”</p>
<p><a id="p-280"></a></p>
<p>Blevins turns next to the non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea in
search of possible borrowings that could throw light on the origins of
<em>mana</em> (pp264–68). In addition to her own set of <em>mana</em>
look-alikes (<a href="#table-10">Table 10</a>, p267) she includes a
putative Trans New Guinea reconstruction, <em>*mana</em> ‘instructions,
customary practices, talk’ from Andrew <a
href="../sources/Pawley2008b">Pawley</a> (<a
href="../sources/Pawley2008b">2008b</a>). But although she may feel
confident about the form of word sought, she is far from certain about
the concept embodied. Is she looking for links with inheritance,
ancestors, traditions, wind, thunder, truth, instructions, ritual,
magic, power? The possibilities are enormous.</p>
<p>Identifying borrowings is possible if the source language can be
located, either close to the borrower or linked with it by trading or
other exchanges. Unfortunately, this is not an option when no reliable
reflexes are identifiable in western Melanesia.</p>
<p>Blevins (p.270) proposes PMP <em>*mana(q)</em> ‘supernatural power,
associated with spirits of the ancestors and the forces of nature;
inherit(ance) from ancestors, including qualities of spirit or body,
customs and laws’ and PEMP/POc <em>*mana</em> ‘supernatural power,
associated with spirits of the ancestors and the forces of nature’. She
has done a careful and thorough exploration of possible antecedents of
<em>mana</em> in its canonic form. But without further as yet undefined
limits, she, like the rest of us, is operating in a very vague field. At
present there are simply too many unknowns for us to accept her
proposals as more than highly speculative.</p>
<p><a id="s-6"></a></p>
<h2 id="evidence-for-a-final--q">6. Evidence for a final
<em>*-q</em></h2>
<p>There are two hints of a possible final consonant in POc
†<em>*mana(q)</em>. One, described in detail by <a
href="../sources/Blevins2008">Blevins</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blevins2008">2008</a>:256), comes from the South
Vanuatu language Kwamera. Kwamera has a term, <em>-aməna</em> ‘work,
produce, enlarge or improve (as one’s resources)’. Although Blevins is
right in noting that Kwamera’s final vowel retention points to loss of a
final <em>*-q</em> or <em>*-R</em> (see <a
href="../sources/Lynch2001c">Lynch 2001c</a>:103–5), the term’s status
as a reflex of PEOc <em>*mana</em> is highly questionable in view of its
semantic distance.</p>
<p>The second instance is from an article by <a
href="../sources/Blytheetal2017">Blythe &amp; Fairhead</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blytheetal2017">2017</a>) which describes information
given by one Dako, a native inhabitant of Uneapa (Bali-Vitu). Dako was
abducted from Unea by an American merchant explorer, Benjamin Morrell,
in 1830, and taken to America where he became an informant to American
Ethnological Society founder-member, Theodore Dwight Jr. Dwight
subsequently published two accounts of Uneapa life and language (1834,
1835).</p>
<p>Dako informed <a href="../sources/Dwight1834">Dwight</a> (<a
href="../sources/Dwight1834">1834</a>:186) that his people ‘acknowledge
one Supreme Being (Manaka), the creator, rewarder of the good and
punisher of the bad’ and how ‘their art of curing diseases and producing
rain is also derived from him’. <a
href="../sources/Blytheetal2017">Blythe &amp; Fairhead</a> (<a
href="../sources/Blytheetal2017">2017</a>:25) continue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it is impossible to recover precisely what <em>manaka</em>
meant to Dako, comparative linguistics and contemporary field data
suggest that it entailed a wider semantic range than ‘supreme being’. …
Uneapa today consider <em>manaka</em> (POc <em>mana</em> or perhaps
<em>manaq</em> (<a href="../sources/Blust2007">Blust 2007</a>)) a
self-manifesting force. … Moreover, <em>manaka</em> also refers to a
genre of myth that describes processes of primordial and ongoing
creativity, including the origins of places, animal and plant species,
and precedents for social practices. The agents depicted in this genre
of myth are not humans but <em>vuvumu</em>, the origin beings whom
<em>Manaka</em> first created and from whom human Uneapa descend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="p-281"></a></p>
<p>Although Bali <em>manaka</em> points to a putative POc
<em>*manaq</em>, semantically there is little commonality with the term
as used in Eastern Oceanic languages. Blythe (pers comm.) does not think
<em>mana</em>/<em>manaka</em> is a personal attribute of humans in the
Bali-Vitu Islands. The Bali term is best considered a chance similarity
rather than cognate with reflexes of PEOc <em>*mana</em>.</p>
<p><a id="s-7"></a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Several POc reconstructions for <em>*mana</em> made earlier have here
been reconsidered. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POc <em>*mana</em> (N) ‘power in natural phenomena’ (<a
href="../sources/Blust2007">Blust 2007</a>)</li>
<li>POc <em>*mana</em> (N) ‘supernatural power, associated with spirits
of the ancestors and the forces of nature’ (<a
href="../sources/Blevins2008">Blevins 2008</a>)</li>
<li>POc <em>*mana</em> (VSt) ‘be efficacious, be potent, be true, be
realised, be successful, “work”’ (<a
href="../sources/Keesing1984">Keesing 1984</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can be confident of a reconstruction to PEOc, but the arguments
given by these three authors for a POc reconstruction remain
unconvincing. An association between supernatural power as evidenced in
human action and powerful forces in nature is suggested only in
Polynesia, where thunder is the powerful natural force. Blust’s evidence
for a connection between thunder and supernatural power in the
Torres-Banks languages and his arguments that ‘wind’ in Papuan Tip
languages can be taken as referring to storm winds are rejected.
Blevins’ argument for an association with ancestral inheritance is based
on very slender evidence while her search for a non-Austronesian source
of borrowing covers an impossibly vast field. While we accept Keesing’s
arguments in favour of a primarily stative verbal meaning for
<em>*mana</em>, as it applies to PEOc, his claim to have a single
Western Oceanic cognate in Tubetube is also rejected.</p>
<p>The possibility remains that <em>mana</em> terms located in the
north-west Solomons are genuine cognates, and are traces of a POc term
similar in meaning to that reconstructed for PEOc, but that is dependent
on further evidence from western Oceanic sources. On present evidence,
our earliest well-supported reconstruction stands as PEOc <em>*mana</em>
(VSt) ‘to have supernatural power from ancestral spirits as manifest in
concrete results; be efficacious’; (N) ‘efficacy, success’.</p>

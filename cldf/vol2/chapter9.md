## 1. Introduction


The kinds of time and duration expressions that we might expect to find in a language are listed below. This categorisation could probably be applied to any language, Oceanic or otherwise, as it appears to have its basis in human cognition and universal experience rather than in the vagaries of English. Part 1 also indicates the structure of this chapter. Why part 2 is not part of that structure is explained below.

 1. Times
    a. Undirected:
       (i)   times within cycles: ‘at midnight’, ‘at dawn’, ‘at midday’, ‘at full moon’,
             ‘at yam harvest’, ‘in daylight’, ‘in the morning’/‘in the afternoon’/‘in the
             evening’/‘in the night’;
       (ii)  labelled sets of times within cycles: names of seasons or lunar months in a
             year, names of periods or days in a lunar month.
    b. Directed:
       (iii) purely deictic: ‘now’, ‘today’;
       (iv)  vague distance: ‘in the past’/‘in the future’, ‘earlier’/‘later’, ‘long ago’;
       (v)   specified distance within a cycle or measured by cycles: ‘last night’/
             ‘tonight’, ‘today’/‘yesterday’/‘tomorrow’, ‘two days ago’/‘two days
             hence’.
 2. Durations
    c. from one time to another:
       (vi)  one time specified: ‘since yesterday’, ‘until tomorrow’;
       (vii) both times specified: ‘from yam harvest to taro harvest’;
    d. length of time: ‘for a long time’.</li>

The rest of this introduction explains this categorisation. The reader is asked to forgive the immediate introduction of two pieces of syntactic jargon, as they are indispensable to this explanation. Times and durations can be expressed in most (if not all) languages as syntactic time __adjuncts__, e.g. _He came __last week__ and stayed __for two days___ or _He was sick __yesterday___. In many languages these adjuncts interact with the semantics of the __predicate__, e.g. ___came___, ___stayed___ or ___was sick__ to produce the temporal meaning of the sentence.

One such interaction is illustrated in English sentences with the time adjunct _yesterday_. In _He worked __yesterday___ or _He was sick __yesterday___, the event lasts for a period of time — for all or part of _yesterday_. But in _He came __yesterday___, the event is to all intents and purposes punctiliar and _yesterday_ is construed as a point in time.[^1] Because many time expressions can be construed as denoting either a point of time or a period of time, no attempt is made under 1 to distinguish between points and periods: both are treated simply as ‘times’.

There is a clear distinction, however, between the time expressions in 1 and the duration expressions in 2. A duration expression denotes a period which begins at one point in time and ends at another. Thus I can say _He worked __from midday until midnight___ or _He was sick __from midday until midnight___ but not _&ast;He arrived __from midday until midnight___. Some predicates of punctiliar meaning do co-occur with a duration expression, but the duration enforces a durative or an iterative construal of the predicate. Thus if I say _He came from __midday until midnight___, this is nonsensical as a punctiliar event, but may mean _He came and stayed __from midday until midnight___. If I say _The light flashed __at midnight___ or _The light flashed __until dawn___, it is the adjunct which determines how the predicate is construed. _Flash_ is semantically punctiliar and _at midnight_ is a time which can be read as punctiliar, so the light flashed only once. But _until dawn_ denotes a duration, so _The light flashed_ is construed as being iterative: the light flashed repeatedly ([Jackendoff 1991](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1991):40–42).

The duration expressions in the previous paragraph all entail, explicitly or implicitly (for _until dawn_, see below), a beginning point and an end point, but other duration expressions, are specified as a length of time: _for six nights_ or _for a long time_.

In English, times — and the beginnings and ends of durations — may be absolute or they may be deictic. Absolute expressions are, for example, _in 1999_ or _on 3rd May 2001_. In terms of token frequency, however, the vast majority of English time expressions are deictic, i.e., relative to the time of speaking or to some other point of time internal to the discourse which is readily recognised by the addressee.[^2] Thus _recently_, _this morning_, _tomorrow_, _two days ago_ and _last year_ are construed relative to the time of speaking, whilst _earlier_, _that morning_, _the next day_, _two days before_ and _the previous year_ are construed relative to some point of time internal to the discourse. _Now_ can be construed either way. Either the beginning or the end point of a duration may be deictically specified: _since Monday_ and _until tomorrow_ mean that ‘now’ is respectively the end point and the beginning point of the time period.


<a id="p-297"></a>

English also has generic time expressions like _in the mornings_ and _on weekdays_. Many undirected expressions (1a) which at first sight appear to be absolute are in fact either deictic or generic, according to context. Expressions like _at midnight_, _on Tuesday_ or _at six o’clock_ may specify a point of time, but, as I noted above, their temporal direction — past or future — is specified by the predicate tense. And such expressions may also be used generically: _The bell rings at midnight_.

Implicit in the previous two paragraphs is the fact that some lexical items used in time expressions denote parts of cycles. In English, at least, _midnight_, _morning_ and _six o’clock_ are parts of the cycle represented by a day, _day_ or _Tuesday_ a part of the cycle represented by a week, _Autumn_ or _September_ a part of the cycle represented by a year. Such cycles are the basis of calendars. However, it is important to distinguish between arbitrary and natural calendrical units. Although the western (Gregorian) calendar grew out of a nature-based calendar, its units today are arbitrary in that they have boundaries which bear, at best, a quite indirect relationship to natural cycles. Thus _midnight_, _six o’clock_, _day_ (as a unit stretching from midnight to midnight), _Tuesday_ and _September_ are all arbitrary points or units. Thus a calendrical year begins (arbitrarily) on 1st January and ends on 31st December and is made up of arbitarily named calendrical months that occur in a fixed order. A calendrical month is made up (in the Gregorian calendar) of a predetermined number of sequentially numbered calendrical days.

The only natural units observed on a day-to-day basis by western English-speaking societies in the temperate zones are the seasons. _Autumn_ is a natural unit (for most English-speakers it does not even have clear natural boundaries, but this is a different matter: a natural unit may have a defined boundary, as we will see below). The natural calendrical units that concern us in connection with Oceanic languages are essentially based on four kinds of cycle: horticultural, floral/faunal, meteorological and astronomical. A cyclic unit, incidentally, does not necessarily have defined boundaries. There is a distinction in English between _last year_, where _year_ is a calendrical unit, and _a year ago_, where _year_ is a length of time ([Leech 1969](Source#cldf:Leech1969):113–114). The same can be true of months and days.

Absolute time expressions in European languages involve a calendrical unit: _in 1999_ or _on 3rd May 2001_. Traditional Oceanic systems offered no equivalent to these, firstly because there was no labelling of years like _1999_ and secondly because there appears to have been no use of units within units like _on 3rd May 2001_, a day of a month within a month of a labelled year. Traditional labels for months and days were used deictically as described above like _in May_ or _on Tuesday_. This means that pre-contact Oceanic systems had no absolute time expressions.

Some Oceanic speaking communities, especially in Melanesia, apparently had nothing resembling a calendrical system. Others, in Micronesia and Polynesia, had naming systems based on lunar months, with names for the months of the year and sometimes names for every day of a lunar month. These systems, however, had not proceeded far along the path towards the arbitrariness of the Gregorian calendar. In some systems all or most of the month names have a recognisable meaning; in others the origins of the names seem to have been lost.[^3]


<a id="p-298"></a>

The implications of this discussion can be a little difficult for a western-trained mind to grasp: the fact that, e.g., a month was a cycle, not a unit, means that months were conceptualised as the passing of cycles, not as collections of countable units. [Whorf](Source#cldf:Whorf1956) ([1956](Source#cldf:Whorf1956):139) says that _ten days_ in English is ‘an “imaginary”, mentally constructed group’— “imaginary” because it ‘cannot be objectively experienced’ like ‘ten men on a street corner’. [Foley](Source#cldf:Foley1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Foley1997):205) comments on Whorf’s formulation that the use of a plural category to express the repetition of temporal cycles is a metaphorical extension from plural groupings of physical objects. Whorf says that the Hopi do not make this extension: if they count cycles at all, they do it with ordinal numbers: “first day”, “second day”, and so on.[^4] The situation in traditional Oceanic societies seems to have been similar. This extract from an oral account of Takia (Karkar Island, NNG) marriage practices as they were explained by an elderly man in 1987 contains similar insights:[^5]

> All right, and so they waited—in the old times they didn’t know about years. They always kept time by the moon. Thus when they wanted to set a time—when they wanted to set a time, they mentioned the month. But they also didn’t know the names of the months. The moon waned and waxed, that’s all. They would say the months in this way: they would count the months with their hands, they would count them with their fingers. And then they would say, the month of the little finger will come and will die, the next finger will die, and the next and in the fourth month the man and woman will get married. They said this—well—with regard to their saying that they would marry in four months …

An English time adjunct may interact with the the tense of the predicate. In the sentences _He came __last night___ and _He will come __tonight___ the temporal direction (1b) — past or future — of the adjunct ‘agrees’ with the tense of the predicate. In _He came __at midnight___ and _He will come __at midnight___, however, temporal direction is expressed only by the predicate tense: _at midnight_ says nothing about temporal direction. If a language expresses the difference between past and future through the predicate, it will not necessarily be expressed in the adjunct. Conversely, if there is no tense difference in the predicate, then the adjunct may well express temporal direction.

Aspect and mood categories are more widely distributed across major Oceanic subgroups than tense categories, and it is therefore probable that POc lacked tense but made extensive use of aspect and mood. Aspect included continuative/habitual, probably marked by reduplication of the verb stem, and completive (perhaps expressed by a serial verb construction ending in the verb ‘finish’). Mood distinguished realis and irrealis. Realis was used for past and present events considered to have occurred or to be occurring, irrealis for future events and all events considered not to have actually occurred (e.g. conditionals). From the lack of tense, we might expect temporal direction to be marked more often on time expressions than it is in English, and this is true in that the temporal prefix _&ast;na-_ marks an expression as past (p.324).

Much play has been made in the linguistic literature of the idea that by metaphorical extension spatial relations form the model for other grammatical patterns ([Gruber 1965](Source#cldf:Gruber1965), [Anderson 1971](Source#cldf:Anderson1971), [Jackendoff 1976](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1976), [1983](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1983), [1991](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1991), [1992](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1992)). This has often been emphasised with regard to time ([H. Clark 1973](Source#cldf:HClark1973), [Jackendoff 1983](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1983):189–193, [Jackendoff 1992](Source#cldf:Jackendoff1992)). However, when we examine the parallels between space and time in English (_at the corner_/ _at six o’clock_, _in Canberra_/_in 1999_, _from Sydney to Canberra_/_from Tuesday to Thursday_), then look for them in Oceanic languages, we find that they do not loom nearly as large in Oceania because so many English parallels depend on the use of calendrical units. Even so, there are some parallels between space and time in Oceanic languages.


<a id="p-299"></a>

Semantically, there is an analogy between the spatial domain and the temporal domain, if we take it that time is a line running from past to future through a deictic point, usually the time of speaking. However, the analogy is limited: space is three-dimensional, but time is only a single dimension. In this analogy, there are parallels between a specific location and a specific time, between generic location (‘at home’) and generic time (‘at night’), and between a path (‘from Sydney to Canberra’) and a duration (‘from midday until midnight’). These parallels are realised in Oceanic languages by the use of similar grammar for both domains (pp.320–321). More specifically, there is a deictic parallel between ‘here’ and ‘now’, but other deictic parallels are less obvious, especially in Oceania, where spatial deixis tends to be person-oriented ([Ch. 8, §3.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-1#cldf:2-8)).[^6] There is also a parallel between temporal directionality (past vs future) and geographic (e.g. ‘seawards’ vs ‘inland’, ‘up’ vs ‘down’) or intrinsic directionality (e.g. ‘to the back’ vs ‘to the front’), as well as between temporal distance (‘long ago’) and spatial distance (‘far away’). However, the distance parallels are limited, as expressions of spatial distance do not also involve direction, whereas expressions of temporal distance typically include past or future denotation (‘earlier’/‘later’). The spatial domain typically lacks anything analogous to the lexicalisation of temporal distances or times within natural cycles (‘today’ vs ‘yesterday’ vs ‘tomorrow’, ‘midnight’ vs ‘morning’ vs ’midday’).

The remainder of this chapter is devoted to reconstructing temporal expressions. It is organised on the basis of the listing under ‘Time’, part A, of the list above. Part B of that list deals with duration. One would expect most duration expressions to be expressed grammatically, and at most a few like ‘for a little while’ and ‘for a long time’ to be lexicalised. However, I have been unable to reconstruct any lexicalised POc duration expressions. I have attempted to find a term for ‘time’ in the sense of duration (as in ‘for a long time’). Oceanic languages clearly have terms with this meanings, but they do not form a cognate set. A number of languages, however, use the reflex of POc _&ast;boŋi_ (p.305) in this sense, and it is possible that this was a POc usage too.

## 2. Undirected times: times within cycles


Cyclic times recognised in Oceanic languages are all natural, as noted above. They include times of day, phases of the moon and seasons of the year marked by a variety of natural events. Some languages also have more detailed naming systems for lunar months and for the days within a lunar month.

### 2.1. The day and times of day: synchronic overview


In most Oceanic languages, the times of the day form a rough taxonomy, with the primary and secondary taxa as follows:


<a id="p-300"></a>

 1. night
 2. daytime
    (a) early morning, from dawn to 9 or 10 a.m.
    (b) middle of the day, from 9 or 10 a.m. to about 3 p.m.
    (c) late afternoon and evening, from 3 p.m. to sunset

The first-order division is, as we might expect, into night and daytime. I have opted to put ‘night’ first, as POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night’ also served as the word for the twenty-four hour period. In Fijian, for example, certain feasts have names like _boŋi-lima_, literally ‘five nights’, denoting the fact that they last five days. In Hawaiian (Pn), the day began at sunset, and this is perhaps the case elsewhere in Oceania. The Motu (PT) expression _varani hanuaboi_ (‘yesterday’ + ‘night’) is interesting in this regard, as it means ‘two nights ago’. That is, the night belonging to yesterday is the one that precedes it rather than the one that follows it.

The second-order division only affects daytime, which has three parts. The periods 2(a) and 2(c) are roughly the first and the last three hours of daylight respectively and are usually denoted by single-word terms. Curiously, there is often no word for the middle six hours of daylight, and it could be argued that 2(b) should be omitted from the taxonomy above. However, there is often a term glossed ‘midday’ in the sources, and this seems to refer to a period of time rather than to noon as a point of time.

The clock times given above are of course vague. The salient feature of 2(a) and 2(c) is that the sun is not high in the sky during these periods (sunrise is shortly before 6 a.m., sunset shortly after 6 p.m. in areas close to the equator). One of the difficulties in setting up the illustrative taxonomies below, however, is that most sources are even vaguer. In fact I have found no source which sets out a taxonomy of times of night and day, and those below are culled from dictionaries, most of which use the terms ‘morning’, ‘afternoon’ and ‘evening’ without much further specification. The term for 2(a) is often glossed ‘morning’, but so, often, are terms for the period immediately before dawn, which is part of ‘night’. ‘Afternoon’ and ‘evening’ are both used for 2(b) and 2(c), and, as I mentioned above, ‘midday’ sometimes seems to denote 2(b).

The sources give a plethora of third-order terms for parts of the day, and a few corresponding terms for parts of the night (which I also treat as third-order terms, despite the lack of second-order terms here). Generally, these terms denote periods of time clustered around the boundaries between the first-order terms. Thus commonly occurring terms for parts of the night denote ‘cockcrow’ and the period between cockcrow and dawn (sometimes divided into two, the second denoting the time of pre-dawn light). There are sometimes terms for the immediate post-dawn period, and at the other end of the day for twilight and dusk. Typically, third-order terms are phrasal.

Below I give taxonomies drawn from Drehet (Adm), Takia (NNG), Gapapaiwa (PT), Kiriwina (PT), Motu (PT), Gela (SES), Marshallese (Mic), Wayan (Fij) and Niuean (Pn). Their distribution is a little skewed, a fact determined by the available sources. They probably vary considerably in terms of completeness and accuracy. The grammatical category of each term is given where it is available, and where I can identify the meanings of the parts of a compound, I have done so. Sources are given in Appendix 1.

### 2.2. The day and times of day: reconstructions



<a id="p-305"></a>

A reconstructable taxonomy for POc is given below (the word-class labels are none too certain). The primary terms for ‘night’ and ‘daylight’ were evidently &ast;boŋi and &ast;raqani. No third-order terms are reconstructable.

|                         |                                                                                   |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __night__               | _&ast;boŋi_ N, V ‘night, day of twenty-four hours’                                    |
|                         | _&ast;rodrom_ V ‘be dark, be night’                                                   |
|                         | _&ast;marom_ V ‘be dark’                                                              |
| __daylight__            | _&ast;raqani_ N, V ‘daytime, daylight’                                                |
|                         | _&ast;qaco_ N ‘sun, daylight’                                                         |
|                         | _&ast;sinaR_ N, V ‘shine, sun’                                                        |
| morning                 | _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_ N, ADV ‘early morning from dawn to perhaps about 10 a.m.’            |
| middle of the day       | —                                                                                 |
| late afternoon, evening | &ast;Rapi N, &ast;Rapi-Rapi ADV ‘late afternoon and evening, from about 3 p.m. to sunset’ |

[Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawleynd) ([n.d.](Source#cldf:Pawleynd)) notes an idiomatic construction in which at least some of these terms co-occurred with POc _&ast;panua_ which, among other things, meant ‘the visible world, land and sky’ ([vol.1,62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:1-3)). The combination of _&ast;panua_ and _&ast;boŋi_, probably as a verb, is reflected in:

|                    |                                                         |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| Motu (PT)          | _hanua-boi_ ‘night’                                     |
| Wayan, Bauan (Fij) | _boŋi na vanua_ ‘be night’                              |
| Rotuman (Fij)      | _hanua he poŋ_ ‘it is getting late, night is coming on’ |
| Rennellese (Pn)    | _henua pō_ ‘night time’                                 |

Presumably the combination meant something like ‘the world is becoming dark’. The expressions below reflect the same construction, with ‘night’ replaced by ‘daylight’:

|               |                                                 |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Lau (SES)     | _fanua sato_ ‘sunny weather’ (< POc _&ast;qaco_)    |
| Wayan (Fij)   | _siŋa na vanua_ ‘be daylight’ (< POc _&ast;sinaR_)  |
|               | _siŋa-levu na vanua_ ‘be midday’ (_levu_ ‘big’) |
| Rotuman (Fij) | _hanua ran_ ‘daylight, dawn’ (< POc _&ast;raqani_)  |


<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. Night


POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night’ also meant ‘day of twenty-four hours’, to judge from the widely scattered reflexes with this meaning (see below NNG: Manam, Poeng; MM: Tolai; SES: Gela, Lau; NCV: Tamambo, Nokuku, Uripiv, Port Sandwich, Lonwolwol; Mic: Kiribatese; Pn: Samoan, Tuvalu, Nanumean, Rennellese, Hawaiian, Marquesan). Blust (ACD) notes that PMP _&ast;beRŋi_ is also reconstructable with both senses. The dual sense is not surprising: in European languages ‘day’ serves in the same way.

All Polynesian reflexes point back to PPn _&ast;pō_ (for expected _&ast;poŋi_, which survived in _&ast;poŋi-poŋi_ ‘be or become morning’ (p.16 and certain other expressions, e.g. Samoan _poŋi-sā_ ‘be dark’ V., ADJ., ‘darkness’ N., _po-poŋi_ ‘(night) be full’ V., ADJ.). Ross Clark (pers. comm.) attributes the replacement of _&ast;poŋi_ by _&ast;pō_ to back-formation from _&ast;poŋi-a_ ‘be overcome by night’, via reanalysis as _&ast;po-ŋia_, with automatic lengthening of the new monosyllabic content word _&ast;po-_ to bimoraic _&ast;pō_.

[PMP &ast;_beRŋi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-305-POc-boi-a)

The reflexes from Huon Gulf languages (NNG: Yabem, Mangga, Mapos Buang) all reflect a verb Proto Huon Gulf _&ast;bok(-)_ ‘be night’ (Mangga _bus(in)_ is a nominalisation): I am assuming that this is an irregular reflex of _&ast;boŋi_. There are other fragments of evidence above (Puluwatese, Rotuman, Rennellese) that POc _&ast;boŋi_ also served as a verb ‘be/become night’.


<a id="p-306"></a>


<a id="p-307"></a>


<a id="p-308"></a>

The word for ‘night’ in a number of Oceanic languages reflects POc _&ast;rodrom_. It is reasonably evident, however, that this term meant ‘be dark’, and did not in POc refer to a period of time.

[PMP &ast;_dem-dem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-308-POc-rodrom-a)

The two sets below probably do not reflect POc _&ast;rodrom_. Rather, _&ast;rodrom_ and the sets below all reflect a PAn monosyllabic root _&ast;-dem_ (see [vol.1,24](ContributionTable?anchor=p-24#cldf:1-2)–25, 27–28). That is, several items reflecting this root were separately inherited into POc.

<a id="p-309"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. Daytime


The POc term which specifically denoted daylight was _&ast;raqani_, reconstructed in Chapter 6 (p.161), to which the reader is referred for further detail.

[PAn &ast;_daqaNi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-309-POc-raqani-a)

The primary meaning of POc _&ast;qaco_ was ‘sun’, but it was also used for ‘daylight, daytime’. Indeed, in Polynesia reflexes of POC _&ast;qaco_ are restricted to the sense of ‘period of a day, daylight’ and do not refer directly to the sun. This item, along with _&ast;sinaR_ ‘shine, sun’, is also reconstructed in Chapter 6 (p.160), where more detail is provided.

<a id="s-2-2-3"></a>

#### 2.2.3. Early morning: from dawn to 9 or 10 a.m.


The POc term for the first few hours of daylight was _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_, self-evidently a reduplicated form of POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night’.

[POc &ast;_boŋi-boŋi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-310-POc-boiboi-a)


<a id="p-311"></a>

Interestingly, terms for ‘early morning’ in some Oceanic languages that do not reflect _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_ nonetheless include that language’s root for ‘night’:

|                   | night                | early morning                        |
|:------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| Drehet (Adm)      | _piŋ_                | _kxe-piŋ_                            |
| Lou (Adm)         | _keli-peŋ_           | _pati-peŋ_                           |
| Loniu (Adm)       | _peŋ_                | _ma-peŋ_                             |
| Bing (NNG)        | _boŋan_ ‘last night’ | _boŋ-sag_ (_sag_ ‘only’)             |
| Takia (NNG)       | _tidom_              | _tidom-lom_ (_lo_ ‘in’, _mi_ ‘only’) |
| Mapos Buang (NNG) | _buk_                | _mon-buk_                            |
| Kiriwina (PT)     | _bogi_               | _ga-bogi_                            |
| Marshallese (Mic) | _pʷoŋ_               | _cip-pʷoŋ_ (cip ‘rise’)              |

POc _&ast;puko_ ‘morning’ is only distributed over a certain area of Oceania — from New Britain to central Vanuatu — but this is enough to meet our criteria for POc reconstruction. To judge from the verbal morphology that occurs on a number of reflexes, _&ast;puko_ often occurred as a verb. Unfortunately none of the reflexes occurs with a gloss which would confirm that this referred to the same time period as POc _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_ ‘early morning’.

#### 2.2.4. Middle of the day: from 9 or 10 a.m. to about 3 p.m.


Outside Polynesia, very few languages have a dedicated word for this part of the day, and those that do show no sign of cognation. Most languages have a phrasal expression, sometimes meaning ‘the middle of the day’:

|                |                                                          |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Loniu (Adm)    | _tiko aŋ_ (_tiko_ ‘middle’, _aŋ_ ‘day, sun’)             |
| Gapapaiwa (PT) | _madeɣa pu_ (_madeɣa_ ‘daylight’, _pu_ ‘middle’)         |
| Roviana (MM)   | _korapa rane_ (_korapa_ ‘middle’, _rane_ ‘daylight’)     |
| Gela (SES)     | _kutu ni dani_ (_kutu_ ‘stomach, womb’, _dani_ ‘daytime) |

Others have a noun phrase whose head is ‘sun, daylight’, modified by ‘big’ or ‘good’:

|             |                                                |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Takia (NNG) | _ad uyan_, _adian_ (_ad_ ‘sun’, _uyan_ ‘good’) |
| Gela (SES)  | _dani-kama_ (_dani_ ‘daylight’, _kama_ ‘big’)  |
| Wayan (Fij) | _siŋa-levu_ (_siŋa_ ‘day’, _levu_ ‘big’)       |

[Biggs and Clark](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)) reconstruct PPn _&ast;qaho-atea_ ‘late morning and early afternoon’, from PPn _&ast;qaho_ ‘daylight’ and _&ast;qātea_ ‘clear, unobstructed’. The addition of Anejom reflexes raises the reconstruction to PROc _&ast;qaso-qatea_ (Lynch pers. comm.).

[PROc &ast;_qaso-qatea_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-312-PROc-qasoqatea-a)


<a id="p-313"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-5"></a>

#### 2.2.5. Late afternoon and evening, from about 3 p.m. to sunset


Just one term is reconstructable for this period of the day, POc _&ast;Rapi_.

[PAn &ast;_Rabi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-2-313-POc-rapi-a)

There are also Micronesian reflexes. These are not listed above because they show hefty phonological reduction. The Proto Micronesian term was _&ast;faka-afi_, reflecting a combination of the POc prefix _&ast;paka-_ (which among other things derived adverbs) and POc _&ast;Rapi_, reconstructed above.

<a id="s-2-2-6"></a>

#### 2.2.6. Third-order terms for parts of the day


I have not been able to reconstruct any third-order terms for parts of the day. As the taxonomies above (pp.301–304) show, in modern Oceanic languages parts of the day smaller than ‘night’, ‘early morning’ and ‘late afternoon/evening’ are usually described by phrasal expressions. The only generalisation to be made is an obvious one—that ‘sunrise’ and ‘sunset’ are denoted by expressions meaning ‘the sun rises’ and ‘the sun sets’. Among the verbs for ‘rise’ and ‘set’ here were almost certainly _&ast;sake_ and _&ast;sipo_ respectively (see Ch. 6, pp.181–182 and Ch. 8, pp.271, 273).


<a id="p-315"></a>


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. The moon and its phases


POc _&ast;pulan_ ‘moon’ also meant ‘month’. The reconstruction here is repeated from Chapter 6 (p.164).

[PAn &ast;_bulaN_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-315-POc-pulan-a)

As a verb, POc _&ast;sinaR_ ‘sun, shine’ (Ch. 6, p.163; above, p.310) has given rise to a number of Polynesian terms which, with the addition of the stativising prefix _mā-_ (Ch. 6, p.164), refer to the moon:

[PPn &ast;_mā-sina_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-315-PPn-masina-a)

Phases of the moon are probably named in every Oceanic language. However, there are differences in how many phases are named. In most languages for which information is available, the month seems to begin with the appearance of the narrowest crescent moon after the three days of darkness. In western astronomical terminology, the ‘new moon’ refers to the days of darkness, but in many of the sources terms glossed ‘new moon’ appear to denote the first appearance after the days of darkness.[^13] Minimal systems have terms glossed ‘new moon’ in the latter sense, for the first quarter (half-moon, roughly 7th day), the full moon (roughly 15th day), the last quarter (half-moon, roughly 22nd day) and the period of darkness. However, it is clear that in some systems these terms may denote a period of two or more nights, whilst in others the sources do not allow us to determine whether they are used for more than a single night. There are also numerous confusions in the English glosses of moon phase terms. Some of these simply reflect the mismatch between 24-hour days and the lunar month of 29.53 days, so that phases do not exactly match days. Others are the result of different uses of terms and perhaps from failures to recognise that phases recognised by Oceanic speakers do not match with those recognised by westerners.


<a id="p-316"></a>

Maximal systems, like those found in Micronesia and in Central Eastern Polynesian languages, have thirty names, one for each day of a lunar month.[^14] Between the minimal and the maximal systems are systems that divide the month into phases of two or three nights each (e.g. Sa’a as reported by [Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927), [1929](Source#cldf:Ivens1929)). Some Oceanic communities, like Mwotlap (NCV), seem to divide the lunar month into phases based on sixths rather than quarters. That is, they have terms for the new moon and (roughly) the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th days ([François 2001](Source#cldf:Francois2001)). From White, Kokhonigita and Pulomana’s (1988) dictionary definitions it seems that Maringe may also be such a language. Kiriwina apparently names days only from the 10th to the 20th day. The Lamotrek days, as listed by [Christian](Source#cldf:Christian1899) ([1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899)) are divided into two sections of respectively ten and twenty days.

Proto Micronesian and Proto Central–Eastern Polynesian sets of day names could probably be reconstructed, but the two sets would not be cognate and, unlike the month names, it is not possible to attribute literal meanings to most of their members (although some of the Polynesian sets apparently name supernatural beings). Hence for POc purposes there is little point in reconstructing them. In fact, there is not a great deal that can be reconstructed of the way that POc speakers talked about moon phases.

The first phase is strictly speaking the days of darkness. Interestingly, the sources vary as to how many of these there are, and [Grimble](Source#cldf:Grimble1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Grimble1931)) claims that the Kiribati did not know.

The denotation of the first visible phase often makes reference to the moon’s thin crescent shape. A number of languages compare it to a crescent-shaped pearlshell ornament, and it is possible that this image was also used in POc. Such artefacts have not appeared in the archaeological record, but they are fairly common ethnographically and a term for them, POc _&ast;japi_ was reconstructed in [vol.1(104](ContributionTable?anchor=p-104#cldf:1-4)). It is reflected in the Arosi term below.

[2-9-2-3-316-pt-motu-huadoai](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-316-pt-motu-huadoai)

Other descriptive terms also occur:


<a id="p-317"></a>

[2-9-2-3-317-pt-kiriwina-kapatu](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-317-pt-kiriwina-kapatu)

Other languages refer to what was apparently the same phase as ‘the young moon’, and here a reconstruction is perhaps possible: POc _&ast;pulan paqoRu_, where _&ast;pulan_ is ‘moon’ (p.315) and _&ast;paqoRu_ is ‘new, young’ (Ch. 7, p.210). Note, however, that I have also treated terms in which lexical replacement has occurred as reflexes of this item.

[POc &ast;_pulan paqoRu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-317-POc-pulanpaqoru-a)

Some languages have a term which means, literally, ‘unripe moon’. This evidently refers to a phase between the new moon and the full moon, but exactly what part of the waxing half of the month it denotes is not clear.

[2-9-2-3-317-pt-kiriwina-tubukonatubugeguda](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-317-pt-kiriwina-tubukonatubugeguda)

Mwotlap, where we know with reasonable certainly that the moon phases are roughly of five days apiece, has a term meaning ‘a piece of the moon’, which refers roughly to the 5th day after the moon’s appearance (whereas ‘the unripe moon’ seems to refer roughly to the 7th). One other language, Drehet, has a similar term:

[2-9-2-3-317-adm-drehet-purekxek](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-317-adm-drehet-purekxek)

Maringe has a term with an apparently similar meaning to Mwotlap:

[2-9-2-3-317-mm-maringe-kafa](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-3-317-mm-maringe-kafa)

Curiously, this is about as far as we can go with reconstructing POc moon phases. Many languages have a term which is glossed in English as ‘half moon’, but I have found none that are cognate with each other, and none that agree on the metaphor they use. Every language has a term for the full moon, but, again, I find no cognates and no agreement on metaphor. A good many languages also have terms for the night (or two nights) immediately before and/or immediately after the full moon.

### 2.4. The year and its seasons


Probably the main seasons for POc speakers living in northwest Melanesia were meteorological: the dry, when the southeast trades blew with reasonable consistency, and the wet, when there were sporadic northwesterly winds. The POc terms for these were respectively _&ast;raki_ and _&ast;apaRat_, which seem to have referred centrally to the seasons, with typical weather and wind direction as inevitable components of their meanings. More details are given in [Chapter 5, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:2-5), whence the reconstructions below are repeated.

[POc &ast;_raki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-4-318-POc-raki-a)

[PMP &ast;_habaRat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-4-318-POc-aparat-a)


<a id="p-319"></a>

The terms I have reconstructed above refer to wind directions and to seasons. A further development is that one of the seasonal terms comes to mean ‘year’ (perhaps something like ‘the annual round’ would be more accurate). Reflexes of both POc _&ast;raki_ ‘dry season’ and POc _&ast;apaRat_ which are used in this way are listed below, but local seasonal/wind terms also tend to be used in this way.

[2-9-2-4-319-nng-kove-hai](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-2-4-319-nng-kove-hai)

In [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1995c) ([1995c](Source#cldf:Ross1995c)) I wrote, ‘There is … no doubt that POc had a separate (and widely reflected) word for year’, and followed it with the reconstruction of POc _&ast;taqun_ below. This statement stands, but with a qualification. The Buang, Tongan and East Futunan reflexes indicate that _&ast;taqun_ may have been used particularly to denote the yam-growing cycle. This would not be surprising: the greater yam, _Dioscorea alata_ (POc _&ast;qupi_; [Ross 1996d](Source#cldf:Ross1996d)) is a highly prized — but not especially nutritious — crop throughout much of Oceania, with much ritual associated with its growth cycle, and so it is a highly salient marker of a year. It is likely that that it already had the meaning ‘yam season cycle’ in POc times.

[PMP &ast;_taqun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-2-4-319-POc-taqun-a)


<a id="p-320"></a>

[Newell and Poligon](Source#cldf:NewellandPoligon1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:NewellandPoligon1993):486) define Batad Ifugao (Central Cordilleran, Philippines) _tawon_ as follows: ‘a measure of the time between a major event such as planting or harvesting rice until it recurs. Traditionally, reference is not to a calendar year; a year does not have a fixed beginning and end.’ The rice harvest was evidently replaced by the yam harvest in POc. Glosses in other languages suggest that _&ast;taqun_ was perhaps originally the name of a particular season, the dry season when food did not grow. We find Isneg (North Cordilleran) _mag-d‹in›axun_ ‘the hot, dry season’, derived from _taxun_ ‘year’ ([Vanoverbergh 1972](Source#cldf:Vanoverbergh1972)), and Binukid (Manobo) _taun_ ‘hunger season’ ([Post 1992](Source#cldf:Post1992)).

In Polynesian languages, there is a tendency, stronger in the east that in the west, for the reflex of POc _&ast;taqun_ / PPn _&ast;taqu_ to denote a ‘season’, in the sense of the dry season or the wet season. [Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):261, 265) believe that the use of these reflexes to mean ‘year’ postdates western contact, but it does seem that the annual cycle of planting and harvesting was a major element of the meaning of both POc _&ast;taqun_ and PPn _&ast;taqu_ ([Kirch & Green 2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):267). The presence of the nominaliser _‹in›_ in the Patpatar and Ramoaaina reflexes above suggests that POc _&ast;taqun_ was also a verb meaning ‘last a year’.

### 2.5. Lunar month names


Throughout much of Oceania there were calendars based on lunar months. However, discussion of these lies beyond the scope of this chapter, which is concerned with the labelling of time units whose connection to nature is fairly transparent. Calendrical names have complex associations with their users’ culture, both material and non-material, and will receive a chapter to themselves in a later volume.


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Directed times: present, past and future



<a id="p-321"></a>

As noted in the introduction to this chapter (p.295), directed times—adjuncts expressing past, present and future—may be purely deictic (‘now’, ‘today’), may express vague distance (‘in the past’, ‘in the future’), or may express a specified distance within a cycle (e.g. ‘this morning’, ‘this evening’) or measured by cycles (e.g. ‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’, ‘the day before yesterday’).

There is strong evidence that most of the temporal terms that are reconstructable in this semantic category belong to the same class as the local nouns reconstructed in Chapter 8 (p.233), and that like those nouns, they occurred in a local construction with the POc preposition _&ast;i_ or formed adverbs with the prefix _&ast;qa-_ (p.322). Some temporal members of the class, however, also formed adverbs by reduplicating the disyllabic root.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Deictic time: ‘now’, ‘today’


No POc form which uniquely means ‘now’ or ‘today’ is reconstructable. In many languages the same term is used for both meanings. Insofar as etymologising is possible (and more often than not it isn’t), the term for ‘now’ or ‘today’ is formed by one of two strategies. In the first, the proximal demonstrative is used. Thus Lou (Adm) _tapoŋ_, Drehet (Adm) _iⁿdah_, Kaulong (NNG) _ai_, Bing (NNG) _nien_, Takia (NNG) _ete_, Gumawana (PT) _ame_, Patpatar (MM) _kaiken_, Longgu (SES) _nene_ are each both ‘here’ and ‘now’. Nêlêmwa (NCal) _lʰeny_ is both ‘this’ and ‘today’.

The second strategy is an extension of the first: a phrase corresponding to ‘this day’ is used. Hence Drehet (Adm) _laŋ nane_, Nguna _raŋi waia_, Niuean (Pn) _aho nei_, all ‘day’ + ‘this’. Nehan (MM) _ene dān_ once meant ‘this day’ (_dān_ < POc _&ast;raqani_ ‘daytime’) but now means only ‘today’.

The claim is sometimes made that Oceanic systems of spatial deixis are also used for temporal purposes. There are very few well documented cases of this beyond the use of the proximal demonstrative ‘here’ for ‘now’. Such cases are Nêlêmwa ([Bril 2002](Source#cldf:Bril2002)), Iaai ([Ozanne-Rivierre 2004](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre2004)), Kosraean ([Lee 1975](Source#cldf:Lee1975):129), Mokilese ([Harrison 1976](Source#cldf:Harrison1976):77–81, 85) and Samoan ([Mosel 2004](Source#cldf:Mosel2004)). However, as [Anderson and Keenan](Source#cldf:AndersonandKeenan1985) ([1985](Source#cldf:AndersonandKeenan1985):298–299) observe with regard to Kosraean and Mokilese, even in these two Micronesian languages the temporal applications of the spatial deictics are not parallel. The same observation is true of the other languages just listed, and so no precise reconstruction of a temporal usage of spatial deictics in POc is possible.


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Vague temporal distance


There are relatively few lexical items in Oceanic languages denoting vague temporal distances. Lexical items for ‘in the past’ and ‘in the future’ used relative to the time of speaking are also used respectively for ‘earlier’ and ‘later’, i.e., for expressions relative to a time named by the speaker. Expressions for ‘recently’ and ‘soon’ are usually phrasal or clausal (e.g. ‘a little time has passed/will pass …’), not lexical.

9.3.2.1 ‘in the past’/‘earlier’ and ‘in the future’/‘later’

Curiously English and other European languages have two superficially contradictory ways of using the spatial analogy to express temporal direction. We say that the past is behind us and the future lies before us, yet when the deictic point is not the time of speaking we say that something in the past relative to that point is beforehand whilst something in the future relative to it is afterwards. The Oceanic spatial metaphor for past and future is the second of these: ‘front’ is past, ‘back’ is future, presumably because that which is in front of one is visible, and so is, metaphorically speaking, the past.


<a id="p-322"></a>

The reconstructions below are repeated from Chapter 8, but only reflexes with a temporal meaning are listed here. The POc terms for ‘formerly’ were apparently _&ast;i muqa_, _&ast;qa-muqa_ and _&ast;muqa-muqa_, for ‘later, afterwards’ _&ast;i muri_/_&ast;i buri_ and _&ast;muri-muri_. In PWOc _&ast;muga_ also occurred (p.258).

9.3.2.2 ‘long ago’

It is hard to avoid the conclusion that _&ast;tuqaRi_ ‘(be) long ago; old (of inanimates)’ is historically related to _&ast;[ma]tuqa_ ‘ripe, mature, adult, old’. POc _&ast;tuqaRi_ appears to be both verb and temporal adverb. The full cognate set is given on p.212, with a discussion of the form of the reconstruction.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Distances within a day or measured by days


POc temporal bases themselves were in general directionless, i.e. neutral between past and future. The exception to this was _&ast;ñoRap_ ‘yesterday’. There is no clearly reconstructable term for ‘tomorrow’, and both ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’ are often denoted by terms which reflect as their base either POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night, day of twenty-four hours’ (p.305) or POc _&ast;raqani_ ‘daytime, daylight’ (p.309). ‘The day before yesterday’ and ‘the day after tomorrow’ both had as their base the directionless _&ast;waRisa_ ‘two days from today’ (p.332).

[Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Pawley1972):32–33, 82) reconstructed the PEOc prefixes _&ast;qa-_ and _&ast;qana-_ as formatives of future and past temporal expressions respectively. In the light of wider evidence, it seems that _&ast;qana-_ was originally two prefixes: _&ast;qa-_ and _&ast;na-_. In both formatives _&ast;qa-_ is the POc adverbialising prefix described in Chapter 8 (p.235), whilst _&ast;na-_ was a prefix forming temporal bases situated in the past. Sometimes, it seems, it was attached to a base which had past meaning, but often it formed a past term from a base which did not express temporal direction. This _&ast;na-_ may well be of PMP antiquity, as it is reflected with the same function in (Western Malayo-Polynesian) languages of the Kaili-Pamona, Wotu-Wolio and SE Celebic families on the island of Sulawesi ([Mead 2001](Source#cldf:Mead2001)).


<a id="s-3-3-1"></a>

#### 3.3.1. Distances within a day


By distances within a day, I mean expressions corresponding to English ‘last night’, ‘tonight’, ‘this morning’, ‘this evening’. Oceanic data relating to these are very thin indeed. I suspect the main reason for this is that expressions consisting of ‘today’ or ‘yesterday’ plus ‘morning’ or ‘evening’ are often used, and they are simply not noted in dictionaries. For example:

[2-9-3-3-323-adm-drehet-kumi](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-323-adm-drehet-kumi)

There are a few languages where _&ast;qa-_ is prefixed to a part of the day to form a future expression, _&ast;[qa]na-_ to form a past expression, but it is not clear whether these expressions are reconstructable for POc or are simply independent innovations resulting from the productivity of the prefixes. Thus we find Nakanai (MM) _ala-logo_ ‘last night’ vs _ga-logo_ ‘tonight’ (_-logo_ < _&ast;rodrom_ ‘night’), Nehan (MM) _na-boung_ ‘last night’, _na-liwo_ ‘this morning (past)’ vs _ro-liwo_ ‘tomorrow’ (the origin of _ro-_ is unknown), and Tongan (Pn) _ʔane-pō_ ‘last night’ vs _ʔa-pō_ ‘tonight’. Niuean (Pn) has terms reflecting _&ast;[qa]na-_: _ne-poŋi-poŋi_ ‘this morning (past)’, _ne-pō_ ‘last night’, and _ne-afi-afi_ ‘yesterday evening’. [Biggs and Clark](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)) reconstruct PPn _&ast;qana-pō_ ‘last night’:

[PPn &ast;_qana-pō_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-323-PPn-qanapo-a)


<a id="p-325"></a>

9.3.3.2 ‘yesterday’

The POc base for ‘yesterday’ was _&ast;ñoRap_. A few reflexes reflect accretion of the preposition _&ast;i_, and just two reflect _&ast;qa-_. Whether _&ast;qa-ñoRap_ occurred in POc or whether _&ast;qa-_ continued to be productive and came later to be attached to reflexes of _&ast;ñoRap_ is unclear. This question is compounded by an interesting distributional phenomenon. We can also reconstruct POc _&ast;na-ñoRap_, with past formative _&ast;na-_ (p.324). This is reflected largely, but not exclusively, in Eastern Oceanic languages, whilst unprefixed _&ast;ñoRap_ is reflected mainly in Western Oceanic languages. There is an overlap zone in the southeast Solomons and northern Vanuatu.

[PMP &ast;_ñeRab_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-325-POc-norap-a)


<a id="p-326"></a>

The Southern Vanuatu members of the set below reflect a Proto South Vanuatu form reconstructed by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c) ([2001c](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c):211) as _&ast;na-yan(a,u)v_. POc _&ast;R_ is sporadically lost in Proto South Vanuatu, and these forms seem to reflect a metathesis of a reflex of _na-ñoRap_ to _&ast;na-Rañop_.

[POc &ast;_na-ñoRap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-326-POc-nanorap-a)


<a id="p-327"></a>

There seem to be at least two other variants on this form. Certain Papuan Tip languages reflect _&ast;Ropa_:

[2-9-3-3-327-pt-tawala-lolowa](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-327-pt-tawala-lolowa)

This seems to be the outcome of a three-step process. First, the vowels of _&ast;ñoRap_ metathesised to _&ast;ñaRop_ (as they have done in Selau _narowa_ in the first _&ast;ñoRap_ set above). Then, _&ast;ñ_ became _&ast;n_ and a paragogic _&ast;-a_ was added, both regular changes, giving _&ast;naRopa_. Finally, _&ast;na-_ was reinterpreted as the past formative, leaving the base _&ast;Ropa_ reflected above.

The forms below reflect Proto NCV _&ast;na-novi_ ‘yesterday’. This contrasts with Proto NCV _&ast;novi_ ‘tomorrow’ (Nokuku _pʷa-novi_, Kiai _i-novi_, Tolomako _i novi_) and so may have nothing to do with _&ast;na-ñoRap_. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) thinks it reflects a conflation of POc _&ast;na-ñoRap_ and _&ast;na-Rapi_ (below), however, and he may be right.

[2-9-3-3-327-ncv-raga-ninovi](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-327-ncv-raga-ninovi)

The term below reflects POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night, day of twenty-four hours’ prefixed with the past formative _&ast;na-_. The reconstruction of _&ast;na-boŋi_ ‘yesterday’ as far back as POc is questionable, as it is not well attested outside Meso-Melanesian languages.

[POc &ast;_na-boŋi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-327-POc-naboi-a)


<a id="p-328"></a>

A few Western Oceanic terms for ‘yesterday’ reflect POc _&ast;raqani_ ‘daytime, daylight’ (p.309). Reflexes in Sio (NNG) and in the Central Papuan subgroup of Papuan Tip languages have a prefix which appears to reflect a preposition reflex of POc _&ast;ua_ (VF) ‘go towards addressee’, (DIR) ‘towards addressee’ ([Ch. 8, §3.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-4#cldf:2-8)).

[2-9-3-3-328-nng-sio-walani](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-328-nng-sio-walani)

The term below is clearly the same root as _&ast;Rapi_/_&ast;Rapi-Rapi_ ‘late afternoon and evening, from about 3 p.m. to sunset’ (p.313). I have placed a question mark against the reconstructed gloss below, as it is not attested in the data. However, the gloss ‘yesterday’ is presumably the result of extension of meanings denoting ‘last evening’. Nuclear Polynesian languages reflect an unexplained innovation whereby _&ast;qa-na-api_ became _&ast;qa-na-napi_.

[POc &ast;_i Rapi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-328-POc-irapi-a)


<a id="p-329"></a>

9.3.3.3 ‘tomorrow’

There is no POc term for ‘tomorrow’ that is as unambiguously reconstructable as _&ast;ñoRap_ is for ‘yesterday’.

We might expect that just as POc _&ast;na-boŋi_ (p.327), with the past formative, was perhaps used for ‘yesterday’, so _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night, day of twenty-four hours’, without a formative, might also have served for ‘tomorrow’. But this would have been ambiguous in at least some contexts, so we would expect some disambiguating marker. We do indeed find reflexes of _&ast;boŋi_ used for ‘tomorrow’, and some of these are listed below, but they do not form a cognate set, and their disambiguating markers vary from demonstratives (Iduna, Sinaugoro) through an adposition (Dawawa) to irrealis enclitics (Mindiri, Bilibil, Matukar).

[2-9-3-3-329-adm-drehet-nekepi](cf.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-329-adm-drehet-nekepi)

We also find reduplicated reflexes of _&ast;boŋi_, but I take these to be reflexes of POc _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_ ‘early morning from dawn to 9 or 10 a.m.’ (p.310). I doubt whether the sense ‘tomorrow’ is also reconstructable for _&ast;boŋi-boŋi_ and assume that these are the outcomes of parallel innovations, similar to those via which reflexes of _&ast;Rapi_ ‘evening’ came to mean ‘yesterday’.

[POc &ast;_i boŋi-boŋi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-329-POc-iboiboi-a)


<a id="p-330"></a>

Reflexes of POc _&ast;puko_ ‘morning’ (p.311) have also come to mean ‘tomorrow’ in a number of languages.

POc _&ast;ma-pua_ ‘tomorrow’ is reconstructable from the rather skewed cognate set below. Data from Sulawesi languages and Balinese cited by [Mead](Source#cldf:Mead2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Mead2001)) point to the reconstruction of PMP _&ast;i-pu(h)a-n_ ‘day after tomorrow, day before yesterday’, and the POc root _&ast;-pua_ here apparently reflects PMP _&ast;-pu(h)a-_. However, the apparent shift in meaning is unexplained.

[POc &ast;_ma-pua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-9-3-3-330-POc-mapua-a)

POc _&ast;ma-raqani_ was presumably originally a verb meaning ‘become light’, derived from _&ast;raqani_ ‘daytime, daylight’ (p.309). Its reflexes in a number of languages mean ‘tomorrow’, as do several other reflexes of _&ast;raqani_ listed below. If it is the case, as suggested on p.300, that the POc day began at sunset, then, once sunset had passed, _&ast;i raqani_ ‘in the daylight’ (reflected directly in Sa’a and ’Are’are) would have referred to the daylight of the present day — ‘tomorrow’ in an English-speaker’s terms.

#### 3.3.4. A note on the derivations of ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’


The derivational relationships (i) between POc _&ast;na-Rapi_ ‘yesterday’, _&ast;qa-na-Rapi_ ‘yesterday’ and POc _&ast;Rapi_ ‘evening’ and (ii) between POc _&ast;raqani_ ‘(become) daylight’ and POc _&ast;ma-raqani_ ‘tomorrow’ reflect a tendency across the world’s languages whereby terms for ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’ are derived from terms for ‘evening’ and ‘morning’ respectively. Terms meaning ‘in the evening’ and ‘in the morning’ lack temporal direction, but this is filled in by the presence of tense or (in some Oceanic languages) mood markers in the verb phrase, i.e. ‘in the evening’ is interpreted as ‘yesterday evening’, then comes by semantic extension to mean simply ‘yesterday’. A similar observation can be made for ‘tomorrow’. This interpretation is proposed by [Buck](Source#cldf:Buck1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Buck1949):999–1000) for the similar derivations that are found for ‘tomorrow’ across much of the Indo-European family and for ‘yesterday’ in Modern Greek, and the Baltic and Slavonic languages. Parallel derivations have also occurred in Finnish and Estonian, in Turkic languages, in Arabic, in Pama-Nyungan and non-Pama-Nyungan Australian languages, in Siouan, in Chinese and in Japanese ([Ross 2001c](Source#cldf:Ross2001c)).

It seems possible that the one directed lexical root above, PMP _&ast;ñeRab_, POc _&ast;ñoRap_ ‘yesterday’ is itself derivationally related to PMP _&ast;Rabi_ ‘evening’.

9.3.3.5 ‘the day before yesterday’ and ‘the day after tomorrow’


<a id="p-332"></a>

As I noted earlier, both ‘the day before yesterday’ and ‘the day after tomorrow’ were denoted by the inherently directionless temporal term POc _&ast;waRisa_ ‘two days from today’. Past direction, i.e. ‘the day before yesterday’, was specified by the past formative _&ast;na-_, but, as with _&ast;na-ñoRap_ and _&ast;na-boŋi_ above, _&ast;na-_ is reflected only (patchily) among Meso-Melanesian languages and more widely in Eastern Oceanic languages. Hence unprefixed reflexes of _&ast;waRisa_ in Western Oceanic languages often denote ‘the day before yesterday’.

Note that reflexes in Bing, Takia and Yabem which lack a reflex of final _&ast;-sa_ have lost it as a result of regular sound changes.

The Proto Tanna (SV) and Proto Polynesian reflexes of _&ast;qa-na-_ lost the past-marking function. Tanna languages add a prefix for future direction, and PPn _&ast;qanoisa_ came to mean ‘the day after tomorrow’.

Apparently an alternative way of expressing ‘the day after tomorrow’ in POc was _&ast;boŋi rua_ ‘day of twenty-four hours’ + ‘two’ (in a few languages the opposite order of elements is reflected, in line with syntactic change). This was perhaps a way of avoiding the ambiguity of temporally directionless _&ast;waRisa_. However, in a few modern languages this expression can also mean ‘day before yesterday’ (in Wayan a preposed particle indicates temporal direction). In two widely separated languages, Tami and Mono-Alu, the reflex apparently means ‘tomorrow’: one can imagine several ways in which this meaning change might have occurred, but none is especially convincing.

#### 3.3.6. More than two days from now


A number of languages have terms meaning ‘in three days time’ (i.e. ‘the day after the day after tomorrow’) and ‘three days ago’, and some have similar terms for up to five days. However, there is no sign of cognacy among them, and it is difficult to reconstruct terms in lower-order proto languages, let alone POc.

### 3.4. Distances within a month/years or measured by months/years


As far as I can tell, only temporal distances within a day and those measured in days were lexicalised in POc. Distances related to the longer periods of months, seasons or years were not lexicalised.

### 3.5. The interrogative local noun ‘when?’



<a id="p-335"></a>

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _&ast;ijan_ ‘when?’, and we would expect the POc form to be _&ast;ican_. This is indeed attested, always with a prefix, but only in a few languages. What we find more widely are reflexes of POc _&ast;ŋaican_ or _&ast;ŋican_, sometimes prefixed with _&ast;qa-_ or _&ast;[qa]na-_. The added _&ast;ŋ[a]-_ of _&ast;ŋa-ican_ or _&ast;ŋ-ican_ seems to be a fossilised reflex of the POc prefix _&ast;ŋa-_, an occasionally reflected alternant of POc _&ast;qa-_ (p.237). This prefix is also reflected in Nakanai _ga-isa_, shown as a reflex of _&ast;ican_ below. The reason Nakanai _ga-isa_ is treated as a reflex of _&ast;ican_, and not of _&ast;ŋaican_, is that in Nakanai _ga-_ remains as a productive adverbial formative on temporal bases, alternating with the past formative _ala-_ (reflecting POc _&ast;[qa]na-_).

From the distributions of their reflexes, it seems that _&ast;ŋaican_ or _&ast;ŋican_ were already alternants to _&ast;ican_ by the time POc broke up.

A scattering of languages reflect the past formative with either _&ast;ŋaican_ or _&ast;ŋican_.

In Proto Polynesian, reflexes of POc _&ast;ican_ and its derivatives had been lost. Instead, the PPn local root _&ast;fea_ ‘where’ (Ch. 8, p.265) was used. The local and temporal uses remained distinct, since ‘where’ was expressed by the preposition _&ast;i_ + root, whereas ‘when’ was expressed by prefixing PPn _&ast;qā-_ for the future and _&ast;[qa]na-_ for the past.

## Notes

[^1]: The meaning of _yesterday_ as a period of time can be preserved by a semantic analysis which interprets it in this context as _at some point of time during yesterday_, but I have not come across a language where the period-of-time and point-of-time uses of ‘yesterday’ are distinguished in the form of the adjunct, and so the assumption here, that the difference between them is one of contextually determined construal, not of polysemousness, appears legitimate.

[^2]: If we think of time as analogous with space, then deictic temporal expressions like ‘recently’ (= ‘a short distance in the direction of the past’) are analogous with deictic-geographic expressions like ‘seawards’ (= ‘in the direction of the coast’), not with ‘pure’ deictics like ‘there’ or ‘yonder’.

[^3]: A discussion of Oceanic month names will appear in a future volume.

[^4]: [Foley](Source#cldf:Foley1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Foley1997):207) is careful to point out that Whorf is not talking about thought per se but about the kinds of conceptual systems that people use to construe experience.

[^5]: The text was recorded, transcribed and translated by Mait Kilil and myself.

[^6]: Note that the parallel between ‘then’ and ‘there’ is anaphoric, not deictic, and so does not belong here.

[^7]: From sunrise until about 10 a.m. when the sun is high.

[^8]: From about 2 p.m. when the sun is no longer directly overhead until sunset.

[^9]:     Each of the two seasons which make up the Gilbertese year, _Nei Auti_ (Pleiades) and _Rimʷimāta_ (Antares) is divided into eight shorter periods called _boŋ_, each separately named (see [Grimble 1931](Source#cldf:Grimble1931):201).

[^11]: Blust (ACD) glosses this ‘day’, but the gloss given here appears more consonant with the data.

[^12]: Tongan _ʔahoʔataa_ ‘at noon today’ seems at first sight to belong here, but, as [Churchward](Source#cldf:Churchward1959) ([1959](Source#cldf:Churchward1959)) shows, it reflects a probably unrelated base _-hoʔatā_.

[^13]: ‘New moon’ is also used in this sense in everyday English.

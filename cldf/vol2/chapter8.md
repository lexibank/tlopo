## 1. Introduction


Talking about space is a part of talking about the environment as a whole. We include talking about space in this volume because some of the terms reconstructed in [§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:2-8) are also used to denote parts of the landscape and seascape reconstructed in Chapters 3 and 4. However, much of the terminology reconstructed in this chapter was also used to talk about space in relation to manufactured objects (vol. 1), to flora and fauna (vols. 3 and 4) and to human beings (vol. 5). Many languages have complex terminologies for talking about space, and the length of this chapter bears witness to the fact that Proto Oceanic was no exception.

Following [Levinson](Source#cldf:Levinson1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Levinson1996)) and [Hyslop](Source#cldf:Hyslop2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Hyslop2001)), we distinguish four kinds of semantic system employed in talking about space. These are listed here with some commentary on their expression in Oceanic languages.


<a id="p-230"></a>

 1. A system of __geographic__ directions based on a division of the environment that
    normally has a vertical (‘up’/‘down’) axis and a horizontal axis. On the horizontal axis
    European languages have the cardinal directions ‘north’, ‘south’, ‘east’ and ‘west’. In
    Oceanic languages there are usually two sets of geographic directions, one used on or
    near land, the other used at sea (cf. [Hill 1997](Source#cldf:Hill1997), [François 2003](Source#cldf:Francois2003), [2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)). Typically each
    has two subsystems.
    (a) The land-based subsystems are (cf. [Ozanne-Rivierre 1997](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre1997)):
        (i)  one with an inland/seaward axis, sometimes with a transverse axis
             pointing left and right along the coast (each axis is typically denoted by a
             local noun in a local construction; p.232);
        (ii) one based on a river valley with an up/down axis (often using the vertical
             terms) and a transverse axis with one directionally neutral (‘across the
             valley’) term (each axis is typically expressed by a directional verb or
             other directional morpheme).
    (b) The sea-based subsystems both refer to a northwest–southeast axis,
        (i)  one using the terms for the northwest storm wind and the southeast trade
             wind (POc &ast;apaRat and &ast;raki respectively; [Ch. 5, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:2-5));
        (ii) the other applying the river valley subsystem with its up/down axis (and
             perhaps its transverse axis) metaphorically to the sea, such that ‘down’ is
             towards the northwest and ‘up’ towards the southeast ([François 2003](Source#cldf:Francois2003), [2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)).
    If we wanted to be particular, incidentally, we could label a number of geographic
    expressions ‘deictic-geographic’. To say that something is seawards, for example, is to
    place it in relation to the speaker. If the speaker were closer to the sea, the same
    referent might be ‘inland’.
 2. An __intrinsic__ system specifies the location of an object in relation to a reference object.
    European languages often use prepositions for this purpose (in, on, under, over,
    beside). A few Oceanic languages also use adpositions, but in the majority a local
    construction is used. This is often an adpositional phrase containing a relational local
    noun, i.e. a noun that refers to a part of the reference object or to a location in relation
    to the reference object (‘inside’, ‘upper surface’, ‘top’, ‘underside’, ‘side’).
 3. __Relative__ locations entail both the position of a reference person, often the speaker, and
    the position of a reference object. Relative locations look like intrinsic locations, but
    the latter do not entail a reference person ([Leech 1969](Source#cldf:Leech1969):167–168). For example, ‘in
    front of the house’ is an intrinsic location because a house has a ‘front’. For an
    Oceanic speaker, this is the side with the ladder, balcony and door. But ‘in front of the
    tree’ is a relative location because a tree has no intrinsic front. When an English
    speaker uses this expression, s/he treats the tree as if it were facing her/him, and so the
    part of the tree that ‘faces’ the speaker is treated as its front. Thus the ‘front’ changes
    with a change in the speaker’s position. Similarly, ‘turn left’ entails a reference
    person—the addressee— and a reference object. The reference object is the
    addressee’s body, and the direction of ‘left’ varies according to the addressee’s
    location and which way s/he is facing. Relative locations are not used in Oceanic
    languages, however. Oceanic speakers use terms like ‘front’ and ‘left’ intrinsically.
    One does not talk about the ‘front’ of a tree, and ‘left’ is strictly an intrinsic part of the
    speaker’s body, not a direction ([Ozanne-Rivierre 1997](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre1997)). Instead, one uses the
    geographic system: ‘seawards of the tree’, ‘go left-along-the-coast’ (cf. [Hill 1997](Source#cldf:Hill1997)).
 4. A __deictic__ system is based on location relative to the speaker or to some other person
    and often also relative to the addressee. Deictic expressions are tied to the context of
    the individual speech act; they do not refer to fixed points in space. All languages
    probably have demonstratives of some kind (‘this’/‘that’, ‘here’/‘there’, ‘voici’/‘voilà’
    etc). Many Oceanic languages in addition have deictic directional morphemes in their
    verb phrases (or sometimes in locative phrases) which indicate whether direction
    associated with the event is towards the speaker and/or, in some languages, towards
    the addressee.[^1]


<a id="p-231"></a>

Relationships between widespread Oceanic categories that probably existed in POc and systems of talking about space are summarised below.

(a) Some __local nouns__ ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:2-8)) are used to express the directions of the vertical,
    inland/seaward and coastal axes of the _geographic_ system. Overlapping with
    these semantically are local nouns that express locations and directions in the
    local environment that are part of the shared experience of speaker and addressee
    (‘home’, ‘bush’, ‘garden’ etc). There are also relational local nouns that express
    locations (‘inside’ etc) in the _intrinsic_ system.
(b) __Directional__ morphemes ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:2-8)) in verb phrases and in adjuncts are used in Oceanic
    languages to express _geographic_ (vertical and valley-based) and _deictic_
    directions. In single-verb predicates and in serial verb constructions these
    morphemes are verbs. Elsewhere they are morphemes grammaticised from
    verbs. Grammaticisation had probably already occurred in some cases in Proto
    Oceanic ([Ross 2003](Source#cldf:Ross2003)).[^2]
(c) __Demonstratives__ are used as static _deictics_. The reconstruction of demonstratives
    is not treated in this chapter.

We can illustrate the typical Oceanic system by summarising the system in Longgu (SES) as described by [Hill](Source#cldf:Hill1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Hill1992), [1997](Source#cldf:Hill1997), [2002](Source#cldf:Hill2002)). Local nouns marking the axes of the geographic system are _asi_ ‘seawards’, _loŋa_ ‘inland’, _alaʔa_ ‘east’, _toli_ ‘west’, _vuʔa_ ‘down’, _laŋi_ ‘up’. Longgu has terms meaning ‘left’ and ‘right’, but their referents are the arms and the sides of the body, and they do not form part of the system of spatial orientation and are not local nouns. Where English would use ‘left’ or ‘right’, a Longgu speaker refers to _aʔae asi_ ‘the seawards leg’ or _aʔae longa-i_ ‘the inland leg’. ‘Nouns such as _komu_ ‘village’ and _luma_ ‘house’ function as place [local] nouns when their referent is the village or house considered to be the “home” location’ ([Hill 1997](Source#cldf:Hill1997):103) and occur in different constructions from when they are used as common nouns (p.233). One of these constructions is with the preposition _i_ or with no preposition. Relational local nouns express intrinsic locations in relation to objects. For example, _ubu-_ ‘inside’ is treated as possessum in relation to the possessor _pera_ ‘basket’:

[2-8-1-None-231-3](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-1-None-231-3)

Other relational local nouns are _buri-_ ‘behind’, _naʔova-_ ‘front’, _gege-_ ‘side’, _orova-_ ‘underneath’, _vavo-_ ‘top surface, space above’, _levua-_ ‘middle, centre’. Demonstratives are also a type of local noun, occurring with the preposition _i_ to indicate a location. Unlike many Oceanic languages, which have a person-oriented deictic system ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:2-8)), Longgu deictics distinguish four degrees of deictic distance from the speaker: _nene_ ‘this, here’, _nina_ ‘that, there’, _ninaina_ ‘that yonder, yonder’ and _nihou_ ‘that/there far away’.

Like many Oceanic languages, Longgu has postverbal particles that distinguish motion towards and away from the speaker — _mai_ ‘hither’ and _hou_ ‘thither’ — and are hence deictic. Some languages have a third particle indicating motion towards the addressee ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:2-8)), and others also have particles expressing the geographic directions ‘up (valley)’, ‘down (valley)’ and ‘across (valley)’ (§.3.3).


<a id="p-232"></a>

There is no one-to-one relationship between the geographic, intrinsic, and deictic systems and the morphosyntactic categories used to express them. For this reason this chapter is organised on the basis of the morphosyntactic categories as they occurred in POc, rather than on the basis of the semantic systems outlined above.


<a id="s-2"></a>

## 2. Local nouns


In POc and indeed throughout the history of many Oceanic subgroups there were three subclasses of noun: personal, common and local. These subclasses are defined by the constructions in which they occur. Since some nouns occur in a number of constructions, they are assigned to more than one subclass.

 1. __Personal__: personal proper names and kin terms used of known individuals. In POc a
    __personal noun phrase construction__ consisted of the personal article _&ast;i_ or _&ast;e_ plus a
    personal noun,[^3] reflected in Taiof (MM) _e Maras_ ‘Maras (proper name)’, _e cina-nai_
    (ART mother-P:3SG) ‘his/her mother’.[^4] In Longgu (SES) personal nouns occur without
    an article, but POc _&ast;i_ is reflected in the ‘pronominal article’ in _i gira_ ‘they’ and other
    free pronouns.
 2. __Common__: human nouns and non-human animates when not used of known
    individuals, as well as inanimates and abstract nouns. A common noun with a specific
    referent was in most cases preceded by the common article _&ast;a_ or _&ast;na_, as in POc _&ast;a_/_na_
    _Rumaq_ ‘a/the house’.[^5] The construction is reflected in Taiof _a numa_ ‘a/the house’,
    _a patu-re_ (ART head-P:3PL) ‘their heads’; Longgu _a komu-i_ (ART village-SG) ‘the
    village’[^6]. If such a noun was used in an __adjunct construction__ it was preceded by the
    sequence _&ast;i ta-_, as in POc _&ast;i ta-ña Rumaq_ (PREP &ast;ta-P:3SG house) ‘at a/the house’.[^7] In
    this construction _&ast;ta-_ was a monovalent semantically empty noun. In most Oceanic
    languages where this latter construction is reflected, however, _&ast;i_ has dropped out,
    leaving _&ast;ta-_ as a preposition.[^8] Hence Taiof _ta-na patu-na tober_
    (PREP-P:3SG head-P:3SG hill) ‘on top of the hill’, Longgu _ta-na iola-i_ (PREP-P:3SG canoe-SG).
 3. __Local__: nouns used with reference to a specific location, a time, or an intrinsically
    located part of something. The POc __local construction__ consisted of the preposition &ast;i
    plus a local noun, with no intervening article. Local nouns include:
    (a) proper placenames;
    (b)  nouns denoting locations, including
         (i)  nouns denoting familiar places like ‘home’, ‘(own) village’, ‘(own) garden’, ‘bush’, ‘beach’ etc.;
         (ii) nouns denoting geographic directions, ‘down below’, ‘up above’;
    (c) temporal nouns;
    (d) monovalent relational nouns, e.g. nouns denoting intrinsic parts, like ‘inside’, ‘upper surface or space  above’, ‘lower surface’, ‘space beneath’ and so on;
    In Taiof a local noun may form a locative expression without a preposition (i.e. _&ast;i_ has
    been lost), like _koma-na matan_ below.[^9] A locative expression with a common noun
   must be formed with a preposition.

[2-8-2-None-232-4](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-2-None-232-4)

   In Longgu local and common nouns are preceded by different paradigms of relators
   and prepositions (the term ‘relator’ is explained on p.268):

|                    |          |             |               |
|:-------------------|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
|                    | location | extent      | direction     |
|                    | ‘at’     | ‘as far as’ | ‘to, towards’ |
| with a local noun  | _i_      | _mi_        | _vu_          |
| with a common noun | _ta-_    | _mi ta-_    | _vu ta-_      |

Thus we find:

[2-8-2-None-232-5](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-2-None-232-5)

   When a local noun indicating a geographic direction follows a verb it may occur
   without a preposition or relator, e.g. lae asi ‘go seawards’.


<a id="p-233"></a>

A noun like _&ast;tama-gu_ (father-my) used with the personal article served as a name (‘Dad’, ‘Papa’); used without an article it served as a common human noun (‘my father(s)’). Similarly, in a local construction a noun like _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘house’ behaved grammatically and semantically like a placename, so that _&ast;i Rumaq_ meant ‘at home’ (p.241), but in the general adjunct construction _&ast;i ta-ña Rumaq_ ‘at a/the house’ _&ast;Rumaq_ was a common noun.


<a id="p-234"></a>

Inspection of the grammars of Oceanic languages shows that many have retained the distinction between local and common constructions, although a majority express it with morphemes other than reflexes of _&ast;i_ and _&ast;ta-_ (for elaboration, see [Ross 2004](Source#cldf:Ross2004)); see also the local prepositions listed under POc _&ast;la[-]_ (p.289). This inspection also shows that common nouns can be readily co-opted into the local construction. Thus it is common to find the common nouns for ‘house’, ‘garden’, ‘village’, ‘bush’ and ‘beach’ also occurring in the local construction, but this does not mean that the POc etyma they reflect necessarily occurred in the POc local construction.

As the Taiof examples above show, the division into common and local nouns cut across the division into zero-valency and monovalent nouns ([vol.1,32](ContributionTable?anchor=p-32#cldf:1-2)).

Zero-valency local nouns denoted familiar places like ‘home’, ‘own village’, ‘own garden’, ‘bush’, ‘beach’, i.e. locations whose reference would be clear to the addressee without further specification or whose exact reference was irrelevant (like the English construction with at and no article in at home, at school, at hospital, at work). Also belonging to the zero-valency local category were nouns denoting regions, either in relation to, say, the island home of the interlocutors or in relation to the speaker. These nouns denote geographic directions such as ‘up above’, ‘down below’, ‘inland’, ‘at sea’ and so on. There is no sharp distinction between these and nouns for familiar places: ‘inland’ and ‘bush’, for example, are often synonymous in Oceanic languages. This is not surprising. [Palmer](Source#cldf:Palmer2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Palmer2001)) points out that the terms for a culture’s geographic directions are commonly grammaticised from perceptually salient phenomena of the landscape. These nouns have sometimes been labelled ‘absolute’ local nouns in the literature, to distinguish them from relational local nouns, but I prefer the label ‘geographic’ as some of their uses are deictic, referring to a location in relation to the speaker and addressee. Familiar-place and geographic local nouns are reconstructed in [§2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:2-8).

Monovalent local nouns, often labelled ‘relational’ nouns in the literature, referred to parts of objects. These are reconstructed in [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:2-8).

In POc the zero-valency/monovalent distinction was apparently not as sharp as it is in many modern Oceanic languages (Lynch, Ross & Crowley 2002:78–79), but there were semantically driven tendencies in the behaviour of nouns. When a noun was viewed as semantically inalienable, like the inside of an object, it was monovalent (i.e. directly possessed, with a possessor suffix), but the same noun could also have zero valency if used in a context where inalienability was irrelevant. For this reason, the relational nouns reconstructed in [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:2-8) have both monovalent and zero-valency forms, and we find cases where some reflexes of a relational noun are monovalent, others zero-valency.

The major local nouns reconstructed below are listed here with simplified glosses, in two groups, relational and familiar-place/geographic. Where a noun is also reconstructed as a common noun, its common-noun gloss is also given, and where a local adverb in _&ast;qa-_ is reconstructable this is also shown.


<a id="p-235"></a>

Familiar-place and geographic local nouns:

| _&ast;liwaŋ_ | ‘open space’            | ‘middle’          | —           |

Relational local nouns:

‘—’ indicates that the item is not reconstructable, ‘…’ that the evidence is insufficient to decide whether it is reconstructable.

[Heine](Source#cldf:Heine1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Heine1989)) observes an implicational relationship ‘under’ > ‘on’/‘in’ > ‘front’ > ‘back’ such that if any of these relational meanings is derived historically from a body-part term, so will be the meanings to the right of it. This is supported by the listing above, as ‘under’ and ‘on’/‘in’ are not derived from body-part nouns, but ‘front’ and ‘back’ are. Heine argues that this is a scale of increasing deictivity from left to right, but [Bowden](Source#cldf:Bowden1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Bowden1992):53) argues that ‘front’ and ‘back’ are based on body-part terms simply because entities in the landscape are not perceived as having intrinsic fronts and backs, i.e. Oceanic languages do not have a relative spatial system (p.230).

### 2.1. The preposition _&ast;i_ and the prefix _&ast;qa-_



<a id="p-236"></a>

The preposition _&ast;i_, which occurred before local nouns, is widely reflected in Oceanic languages, but there are also many languages in which a local noun occurs without a preposition.

[PAn &ast;_i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-1-236-POc-i-a)

Tongan, Niuafo’ou and East Uvean _ʔi_ are phonologically problematic, as they reflect POc _&ast;qi_, the form of the genitive preposition governing a non-specific inalienable possessor ([Pawley 1972](Source#cldf:Pawley1972), [Clark 1976](Source#cldf:Clark1976), [Hooper 1985](Source#cldf:Hooper1985), [Ross 1998b](Source#cldf:Ross1998b), [2001b](Source#cldf:Ross2001b)). However, as [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Clark1976)) and Blust (ACD) note, the introduction of a historically secondary glottal stop also occurs in some other Tongan grammatical formatives.

POc _&ast;i_ occurred with local nouns. Its exact distribution is not clear, but it is likely that _&ast;i_ was omissible if the phrase it initiated was licensed by the verb.

There are a number of languages in which the reflex of _&ast;i_ is the general locative preposition. I take these to be cases where an extension of meaning has occurred, as there are ample and widely distributed languages where _&ast;i_ is attested only with local nouns.


<a id="p-237"></a>

As mentioned above, a number of local nouns also formed POc local adverbs with the prefix _&ast;qa-_. [Jauncey](Source#cldf:Jauncey1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Jauncey1997)) notes for Tamambo that the prefix _a-_ means ‘location in/at a place’, and must be prefixed to a noun signifying a place in relation to the speaker, i.e. a local noun. The cognate set is listed below. This is the _&ast;qa-_ which [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Pawley1972):82, 114) found in Southeast Solomonic and Northern Vanuatu languages as a formative of temporal adverbs (Ch. 9, p.324).

[POc &ast;_qa-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-1-237-POc-qa-a)

There also seems to have been an alternant _&ast;ŋa-_, reflected in Poeng (NNG) _ŋa-_, Nakanai (MM) _ga-_, Longgu (SES) _ŋa-_ and Samoan, Tikopia (Pn) _ŋa-_, but it is not strongly attested.


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Familiar-place and geographic local nouns


The nouns reconstructed in this section are zero-valency local nouns denoting regions, either in relation to the island home of the interlocutors or in relation to the speaker. They have meanings like ‘inland, bush’, ‘seaward, beach’, ‘down below’ and ‘up above’. Some of these glosses are adverbial in English. This is because a zero-valency local noun preceded by _&ast;i_ often performed the task of an English adverbial. For example, POc _&ast;i_ tanoq evidently expressed something like ‘down there’.

Some POc zero-valency local nouns, at least, were also used as common nouns, and this difference sometimes also entailed a difference in meaning. Thus _&ast;i tanoq_ meant ‘down there’ but _&ast;tanoq_ meant ‘earth, soil’ ([vol.1,119](ContributionTable?anchor=p-119#cldf:1-5)); _&ast;i qutan_ meant, among other things, ‘inland’, but _&ast;qutan_ meant ‘bushland’ ([vol.1,118](ContributionTable?anchor=p-118#cldf:1-5)).


<a id="p-238"></a>

As far as possible, the cognate sets below are limited to reflexes of local-noun uses. However, the glosses of the reconstructions distinguish between common-noun (N) and local-noun (N LOC) meanings.


<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. ‘Inland, bush’


As a common noun POc _&ast;qutan_ meant ‘bushland, hinterland’ ([vol.1,118](ContributionTable?anchor=p-118#cldf:1-5); this volume, [Ch. 3, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:2-3)). As a local noun, however, _&ast;qutan_ denoted the direction of the bush, namely ‘inland’. By extension, this has come to mean ‘upwards’ in a number of languages, by virtue of the fact that the inland region is significantly higher than the coast on many Pacific islands.

[PAn &ast;_quCaN_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-238-POc-qutan-a)


<a id="p-239"></a>

The cognate set below has fewer members that the one above, but appears to reflect a local noun with similar meanings. Polynesian reflexes display a vowel change and a change in meaning from ‘inland’ to ‘top, space above, up top’, a change presumably mediated by the fact that on a high island (as opposed to atoll) the inland of the island was also its ‘top’.

[POc &ast;_loŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-239-POc-loa-a)


<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. ‘Seaward, towards the beach, at sea’


The principal POc local noun meaning ‘seawards’ was _&ast;laur_, and it was evidently the antonym of _&ast;qutan_ and _&ast;loŋa_ above. It reflects PMP _&ast;lahud_ ‘downriver, towards the sea’, and it is likely that it was inherited into POc primarily, perhaps exclusively, as a local noun denoting a direction (for common-noun reflexes, see p.95). In this regard it differed from POc _&ast;tasik_ ‘sea, salt water’ and POc &ast;laman ‘deep sea beyond the reef’, reconstructed in Chapter 4, which were common nouns.

POc _&ast;tasik_ is quite often reflected as a local noun and presumably functioned as both a local and a common noun in POc. Occasional reflexes have meanings similar to those of POc _&ast;laur_, but most mean ‘at sea’, and this was presumably its POc meaning.

It is unlikely that POc _&ast;laman_ normally occurred as a local noun, as only two local noun reflexes have been found (Mussau [Adm] _lamana_ ‘beach’, Tigak [MM] _laman_ ‘down there, at the beach’).

#### 2.2.3. Directions along the coastline


The items reconstructed above for ‘inland’ and ‘seawards’ were orientations at an angle to the coastline. Also recorded for a few languages are items referring to the two directions along the coastline. Possible PWOc candidates for these meanings are given below. Although the data are fragmentary, the fact that both members of the pair are recorded in widely separated languages supports their reconstruction. The Nalik glosses ‘south-east’ and ‘north-west’ are equivalent respectively to ‘to one’s left when facing the sea’ and ‘to one’s right when facing the sea’ if one is on the west coast of New Ireland.

[PWOc &ast;_ta_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-240-PWOc-ta-a)

Nakanai (MM) has the non-cognate pair of roots (used in directional and local verbs) _-ale_ ‘to one’s left when facing the sea’ and _-muli_ ‘to one’s right when facing the sea’.


<a id="p-241"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-4"></a>

#### 2.2.4. ‘At home’


The cognate set attesting POc _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘house’ was presented in [vol.1,48](ContributionTable?anchor=p-48#cldf:1-3). It is reasonably clear that it also functioned as a local noun in the phrase _&ast;i Rumaq_ ‘at home’, and apparently also in the adverb _&ast;qa-Rumaq_.

[PAn &ast;_Rumaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-241-POc-rumaq-a)


<a id="s-2-2-5"></a>

#### 2.2.5. ‘Down below’


POc _&ast;tanoq_ is reconstructed as a common noun meaning ‘earth, soil, ground; land’ in [vol.1,119](ContributionTable?anchor=p-119#cldf:1-5) and in this volume, p.41. However, there is well distributed evidence that as a local noun it meant ‘down below’. This is not surprising when one considers that POc speakers must generally have lived in stilt houses ([vol. 1, Ch. 3](ContributionTable#cldf:1-3)) for whose inhabitants the ground was indeed ‘down below’.

[PMP &ast;_taneq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-241-POc-tanoq-a)

The meanings above overlap with the adverb reflexes of POc _&ast;sipo_ ‘go downward’, (ADV) ‘down below’, but _&ast;tanoq_, a noun, and &ast;sipo a verb (and perhaps adverb), belonged to different word classes ([§3.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-1#cldf:2-8)).


<a id="p-242"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-6"></a>

#### 2.2.6. ‘Up above’


A few of the reflexes of POc _&ast;atas_ ‘top, space above’ are monovalent relational nouns. However, the vast majority of reflexes are geographic, not relational, nouns, and it seems that POc _&ast;atas_ was also a geographic noun. It also seems that it was not a common noun (in this respect it resembles POc _&ast;laur_, p.239).

The items listed under ‘cf. also’ below reflect a Proto North Bougainville form _&ast;yasa_, which has replaced _&ast;yatasa_. Possibly _&ast;yasa_ is derived from expected _&ast;yatasa_ by idiosyncratic deletion of the middle syllable.

[PAn &ast;_aCas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-242-POc-atas-a)


<a id="p-243"></a>

POc _&ast;laŋit_ ‘sky, weather’ is reconstructed as a common noun in Chapter 5, but the reflexes below suggest that it was also used as a POc local noun.

[PAn &ast;_laŋiC_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-243-POc-lait-a)

The meanings above overlap with the adverb reflexes of POc _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward’, (ADV) ‘upwards, up top’, but _&ast;atas_ and _&ast;laŋit_ were nouns, _&ast;sake_ a verb (and perhaps adverb, p.277).

It is less clear whether POc _&ast;laka_ ‘up above’ was a noun or a verb. In Takia its reflex is a zero-valency noun, in Mapos Buang and Kiriwina a local adverb. These could be derived from either a noun or a directional verb. Monovalent noun reflexes occur in the two New Ireland (MM) languages Lihir and Siar, but in other New Ireland languages (Lavongai, Tigak and Kara) the reflexes are verbs. However, the Southeast Solomonic reflexes reflect the derived adverb _&ast;qa-laka_ ‘up there, up above’ (which was then used as a verb in some SES languages). Since _&ast;qa-_ is far more readily reconstructable as a prefix to nouns than to verbs, I assume that _&ast;laka_ was a noun.

[POc &ast;_laka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-243-POc-laka-a)

There was also a POc verb _&ast;laka_, which meant ‘walk’ and apparently had no directional meaning.


<a id="s-2-2-7"></a>

#### 2.2.7. ‘In the middle, between’



<a id="p-244"></a>

There is well distributed evidence that POc _&ast;liwaŋ_, _&ast;liwa-_/_&ast;liwaŋa-_ was a local noun meaning ‘open space, space between, middle’, and that it had at least one relational alternant. The form we would expect to find reflected in most languages with relational forms is POc _&ast;liwa-_. However, we also find reflexes of _&ast;liwaŋa-_. This may be the result of local developments, and this in turn may suggest that there was no relational form in POc.

The forms listed below under ‘cf. also’ are similar in form to those listed here. However, the fact that they share a formal irregularity — they seem to reflect POc _&ast;lua_ — and a different meaning — ‘outside’ — suggests that POc _&ast;lua_ ‘outside’ may have been a separate etymon, and also a local noun.

[PMP &ast;_liwaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-2-244-POc-liwa-a)


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Relational local nouns


The function of a POc monovalent relational local noun preceded by _&ast;i_ was similar to that of an English preposition, as in these Tabar (MM) examples, where the relational noun _paki-_ ‘underneath’ performs a function similar to that of the English preposition under.[^10]

[2-8-2-3-244-6](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-244-6)


<a id="p-245"></a>

In these Lengo (SES) expressions the relational noun _muri-_ ‘back’ performs a function similar to that of the English preposition behind.

[2-8-2-3-245-7](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-245-7)

Hence we can with reasonable confidence make POc reconstructions such as:

[2-8-2-3-245-8](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-245-8)

Many Oceanic languages have relational nouns with the meanings reconstructed below: ‘inside’ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:2-8)), ‘underneath, lower surface, space below’ ([§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:2-8)), ‘top, upper surface, space above’ ([§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:2-8)), ‘side’ ([§2.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-4#cldf:2-8)), ‘outside’ ([§2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:2-8)), ‘front, time before’ ([§2.3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-6#cldf:2-8)), ‘back, space behind, time after’ ([§2.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-7#cldf:2-8)). Although the nearest semantic equivalents of Oceanic relational nouns are English prepositions, I have used nouns and noun phrases in the titles of these subsections in an attempt to replicate the meanings of the reconstructed Oceanic terms.[^11]

In their monovalent form, relational local nouns are reconstructed below like other monovalent nouns, i.e. without their final consonant, on the assumption that it was lost before a possessor suffix: for example, _&ast;lalom_ ‘inside’ became _&ast;lalo-_, &ast;papak ‘underneath’ became _&ast;papa-_. However, as I note in [Lynch et al.](Source#cldf:Lynchetal2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Lynchetal2002), Ch. 4), there is some evidence from Tanna languages (SV) that POc retained the final consonant in this context, so that, e.g., POc _&ast;lalo-ña_ in the reconstructed example above may have been (optionally?) _&ast;lalom-ña_.


<a id="s-2-3-1"></a>

#### 2.3.1. ‘Inside’



<a id="p-246"></a>

The most widely reflected POc term for ‘inside’ is _&ast;lalo-_/_&ast;lalom_. This reflects PMP _&ast;Daləm_ with assimilation of the initial liquid to the intervocalic liquid: the expected POc form is _&ast;&ast;ralo-_/_&ast;&ast;ralom_. Reconstruction of unsuffixed _&ast;lalom_ is supported by just one reflex, Mussau _e-lom-e_.[^12]

In Polynesian languages reflexes of _&ast;lalo-_/_&ast;lalom_ denote the region underneath something. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Blust1997)) suggests that this meaning change comes from the use of _&ast;lalom_ in relation to a planar surface, the sea, rather than a three-dimensional container.

[PMP &ast;_Daləm_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-246-POc-lalo-a)


<a id="p-247"></a>

There is evidence that POc _&ast;lalo-_ had two short forms, _&ast;lo-_ and _&ast;la-_. A number of their reflexes occur as prepositions and may have been conflated with reflexes of POc _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ ‘go (to); away from speaker’. They are listed together with a discussion of this conflation in [§3.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-5#cldf:2-8). Listed below are those reflexes of the short forms which are not prepositions; most are local nouns. Significantly, there is a difference between the distributions of the two short forms. Reflexes of _&ast;lo-_ occur quite commonly as local nouns, and a number of them have a fossilised prefix reflecting the POc local preposition _&ast;i_. Reflexes of _&ast;la-_ have a stronger tendency to occur as prepositions (p.288), and may reflect the short form of _&ast;lako_ rather than of _&ast;lalo-_.

There is, of course, also a possibility that _&ast;lalo-_ has undergone haplology to form _&ast;lo-_ more than once in the history of Oceanic languages, but reflexes of _&ast;lo-_ below and in [§3.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-5#cldf:2-8) are widespread enough to warrant its reconstruction in POc.

[POc &ast;_lo-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-247-POc-lo-a)

[POc &ast;_la-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-247-POc-la-a)


<a id="p-248"></a>

POc _&ast;loto-_ ‘space within a concave object’ is not well supported. It has become the default relational noun for ‘inside’ in Polynesian languages (where POc _&ast;lalo-_ is reflected with the meaning ‘underneath’; see above) and is also reflected in Wayan Fijian, so it can be reconstructed for Proto Central Pacific. Its reconstruction in POc rests on a single Admiralties reflex, Loniu _lɔtiyɛ-_, with _-i-_ for expected _-o-_.

[POc &ast;_loto_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-248-POc-loto-a)

In many Oceanic languages the word for ‘inside’ is the reflex of a POc body-part term. Two of these may have had the secondary meaning ‘inside’: POc _&ast;bʷal(o,a)-_, _&ast;bʷal(o,a)k_ seems to have denoted the belly, POc _&ast;tinaqe-_ the intestines.

[POc &ast;_bʷal(o,a)-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-248-POc-baloa-a)

<a id="s-2-3-2"></a>

#### 2.3.2. ‘Underneath, lower surface, space below’



<a id="p-249"></a>

The most widely reflected POc term for ‘underneath, underside’ is _&ast;papa-_, _&ast;papak_. This reflects PMP _&ast;babaq_, which Blust reconstructs as referring to the underside or lower surface of something (the change from PMP _&ast;-q_ to POc _&ast;-k_ is unexplained). In a number of Oceanic languages, its meaning also includes the space beneath something, e.g. a house (see the NNG reflexes below), and it is probable that this extension of meaning had already occurred in POc. Its zero-valency forms are the source of local adverbs meaning ‘below, down there’ in a number of languages.

Scattered reflexes also suggest the reconstruction of monosyllabic forms without the first (reduplicated) syllable. An innovative monovalent form _&ast;pʷake-_ is reflected in Meso-Melanesian languages, apparently by the addition of _&ast;-e_ to the monosyllabic form _&ast;pak_.

No reflexes occur in Central Pacific languages. In Fijian, _&ast;papa-_, _&ast;papak_ has been ousted by reflexes of POc _&ast;ruku-_ ‘underneath’ (see below), in Polynesian languages by reflexes of POc _&ast;lalom_ ‘inside’ (p.247).

[PMP &ast;_babaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-249-POc-papa-a)


<a id="p-250"></a>

Three other POc terms can be reconstructed with a meaning related to ‘underneath’ or with a denotation which has given rise to it in daughter languages.

Several reflexes of the first, POc _&ast;ruku-_, are concatenated with a reflex of _&ast;pa-_ ‘underside’, the short form of _&ast;papa-_. These seem to be compounds, implying that the meaning of _&ast;ruku-_ was perhaps more specific than that of _&ast;papa-_. The latter was evidently the generic term for ‘underneath’. Perhaps &ast;ruku- denoted the undersurface of something.

The second term, POc _&ast;gabʷari-_ meant ‘the area underneath a raised house’ ([vol.1,51](ContributionTable?anchor=p-51#cldf:1-3)) and has come to mean ‘underneath’ in some languages by extension. POc _&ast;puqu-_, _puqun_ had the relational meaning ‘base, foundation’ when used in association with an object, as well as the more abstract meaning ‘origin, source, reason’.

<a id="s-2-3-3"></a>

#### 2.3.3. ‘Top, upper surface, space above’



<a id="p-252"></a>

The basic POc term for ‘top, upper surface, space above’ is _&ast;papo[-]_, _&ast;po[-]_. Blust (ACD, 1997) writes that PMP _&ast;babaw_ ‘upper surface, top’ is the antonym of PMP _&ast;babaq_ ‘lower surface, bottom’, and the same is true of their POc reflexes: POc _&ast;papo[-]_, _&ast;po[-]_ is the antonym of POc _&ast;papa-_, _&ast;papak_ (p.249).

The unsuffixed forms are a source of local adverbs meaning ‘above, up there’ in a number of languages, although here POc _&ast;qulu[-]_ below is a close competitor.

The Kiribati (Mic) reflex of POc _&ast;papo[-]_ also has the meaning ‘outside’, and this is the sole sense of the Nemi (NCal) and Polynesian reflexes. Blust (ACD) suggests that (as with _&ast;lalom_; p.246) this is the result of applying the term to the planar surface of the sea. In relation to the sea, _&ast;papo[-]_ was its surface and the space above it. This is beyond the land, hence ‘outside’ it.

[PMP &ast;_babaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-252-POc-papo-a)


<a id="p-253"></a>

Given the tendency for body-part terms to be used by metaphorical extension as relational nouns (cf. p.248), it is unsurprising that the word for ‘head’ and ‘head hair’, POc _&ast;qulu[-]_, also acquired the meaning ‘top’.

[PAn &ast;_qulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-253-POc-qulu-a)

In NCV languages we find reflexes of the adverb _&ast;qa-qulu_ ‘up there, up above’: NE Ambae _a-ulu_ ‘up high, on top’, Tamambo _a-ulu_ ‘on top, at the gardens’, Kiai _aulu_ ‘above’.


<a id="s-2-3-4"></a>

#### 2.3.4. ‘Side’



<a id="p-254"></a>

It is tempting to look for a POc relational noun which would correspond in its use to the English preposition ‘beside’. However, in many of its English uses ‘beside’ denotes a relative location, and, as I noted in [§1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1#cldf:2-8), speakers of Oceanic languages do not make use of relative locations. We would expect POc reconstructions corresponding to meanings of English ‘side’ to denote an intrinsic, not a relative, location, and consequently perhaps to denote a part of a particular object.

This expectation is at least partly fulfilled. We can reconstruct POc _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa[-]_ ‘side; cheek’, a body-part term whose primary meaning was probably ‘side of the face’. Its uses are analogous to those of POc _&ast;mata[-]_ ‘eye; face; front’ (p.249). However, a good deal of confusion surrounds reflexes of _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa[-]_. Reflexes of POc _&ast;baban_/_&ast;bapan_ ‘plank; canoe plank or strake’ ([vol.1,185](ContributionTable?anchor=p-185#cldf:1-7)) are similar in both form and meaning to those of _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa[-]_. Listed under ‘cf. also’ below _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa[-]_ are terms whose glosses include the meaning ‘side’ but whose forms reflect _&ast;baban_. The Lau and Bauan reflexes have glosses which are associated with both items, suggesting conflation.

[PCEMP &ast;_papaR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-254-POc-papara-a)

POc _&ast;pʷala(ŋ)_ ‘side, part’ is reconstructable, but its exact sense is unclear.

[PMP &ast;_balaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-254-POc-pala-a)


<a id="p-255"></a>

POc _&ast;bali_ denoted ‘one of two (opposing) sides or parts’.

[PMP &ast;_baliw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-255-POc-bali-a)

There are two other reconstructions from which terms for ‘side’ are derived. One, POc _&ast;siriŋ_ ‘side, edge’, is derived from a PMP term whose basic meaning was apparently ‘be close to, be near to’. Only three Oceanic reflexes have been found to date. The other, PEOc _&ast;tapa-_ ‘side, outside’, is limited to Eastern Oceanic, where the earlier sense seems to have been ‘side’ in the sense of ‘outer surface other than front or back’.

<a id="s-2-3-5"></a>

#### 2.3.5. ‘Outside’


It is reasonably clear that the ‘inside’/‘outside’ opposition found in European languages did not occur in POc. This is unsurprising, since POc relation terms were nouns denoting parts of an object. The inside of a house is readily conceived as a part of it (POc _&ast;lalo-_), but the English term ‘outside’ only denotes a part insofar as it refers to the external surfaces of the building. As noted at various points in [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:2-8), terms which denote (among other things) particular external surfaces are also used metonymically to denote the external surface or ‘outside’ of an object in general. This is true of some reflexes of POc _&ast;papo[-]_ ‘upper surface, top’ (p.252), of POc _&ast;muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear’ (p.261) and of PEOc _&ast;tapa-_ ‘side, outside’ (above).


<a id="p-256"></a>

The terms in the set below could tempt us to reconstruct POc _&ast;luku-_ ‘side, outside’.[^16] However, their uneven distribution is suspicious, and it seems far more likely that they reflect PMP _&ast;likuD_, POc _&ast;liku(r)_ ‘(person’s) back’ ([Blust 1981b](Source#cldf:Blust1981b)). The meaning of scattered reflexes of this word has extended to include the backs and rear parts of inanimate objects (like POc _&ast;muri[-]_), and thence the external surfaces of objects in general. The specification of ‘back’ in the Marshallese and Woleaian reflexes below supports this interpretation.

[2-8-2-3-256-yap-yapese-wuu](cf.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-256-yap-yapese-wuu)


<a id="s-2-3-6"></a>

#### 2.3.6. ‘Front, time before’


According to [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Blust1997)), the PMP relational noun for ‘front’ was _&ast;qadəp_ ‘front’, which was also used of the human face. Although reflexes of this term have been replaced by body-part terms (see below) in a majority of Oceanic languages, enough reflexes survive to make it clear that its reflex POc _&ast;qaro-_, _&ast;qarop_ ‘front; face’ is reconstructable.

[PAn &ast;_qadəp_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-256-POc-qaro-a)

None of the items above reflects final POc _&ast;-p_, but we can be certain that the form _&ast;qarop_ occurred, as a reflex is preserved in PPn _&ast;ʔarofiwaʔe_ ‘sole of foot’ (e.g. Tongan _ʔaofi vaʔe_, East Futunan _ʔalofi-vaʔe_, Samoan _alofivae_), reflecting POc _&ast;qarop qi qaqe_, literally ‘front of foot’ (where _&ast;qi_ is the non-specific possessive preposition ([Ross 1998b](Source#cldf:Ross1998b), [2001b](Source#cldf:Ross2001b))).


<a id="p-257"></a>

Another generic POc term for ‘front’ (but probably not ‘face’) was _&ast;muqa[-]_, which — its reflexes suggest — occurred more often as a zero-valency than a monovalent noun. As a zero-valency local noun it occurred in the prepositional phrase _&ast;i muqa_ ‘in front, formerly’. The reduplicated form _&ast;muqa-muqa_ ‘in front, formerly’ represents a morphological pattern not found with other local nouns.

As the glosses indicate, POc _&ast;muqa[-]_ had the temporal sense of ‘time before’ as well as the local sense of ‘front’. It was thus the antonym of POc _&ast;muri[-]_ ‘back, time after’ ([§2.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-7#cldf:2-8)).

[POc &ast;_muqa&#91;-&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-257-POc-muqa-a)


<a id="p-258"></a>

In NCV languages we find reflexes of the adverb _&ast;qa-muqa_ ‘in front, formerly’: Mota _(a)mʷoa_ ‘before, first’, Raga _(a)mua_ ‘before, at first, first, in front of’, NE Ambae _(a)mue_ ‘in front, at the front’, Port Sandwich _(a)mo_ (POSTVERBAL ADV) ‘before’.

There is evidence in Western Oceanic languages for a competing form _&ast;muga_. This occurs far more often in verbal reflexes than does _&ast;muqa_, so it is possible that _&ast;muga_ was the POc verb, and that &ast;muqa supplanted _&ast;muga_ in PEOc. The possibility of conflating the two terms is illustrated in Vitu and Bali, dialects of the Bali-Vitu language. In one, Vitu, the monovalent term for ‘front’ is _muɣa-_, reflecting _&ast;muqa_, whilst in the other, Bali, it is _muga-_, reflecting _&ast;muga_. Since reflexes of _&ast;muga_ are otherwise not monovalent, it is reasonable to infer that this is a conflation whereby the noun _muɣa-_ has been replaced by the verb-form _muga_.

Although _&ast;muqa_ and _&ast;muga_ are formally similar, a historical relationship between them is problematic: we would expect an alternation between POc _&ast;k_ and _&ast;g_, but not between _&ast;q_ and _&ast;g_.[^17]

<a id="p-259"></a>

The body-part terms whose reflexes are often used for ‘front’ are POc _&ast;mata[-]_ ‘eye, face, front’ and POc _&ast;nako[-]_ face, front’. The original and basic meanings of _&ast;mata[-]_ and _&ast;nako[-]_ were ‘eye’ and ‘face’ respectively. Nonetheless, reflexes of these terms occur with great frequency in the meaning ‘front’. Scattered reflexes below suggest that _&ast;i mata_ was a POc expression meaning ‘in front’, and other modern uses suggest that it has long been used for the front of an inanimate object, e.g. Nalik (MM) _la maran a fal_ [PREP eye PREP house] and Tolai (MM) _ta ra mata-na pal_ [PREP ART eye-P:3SG house], both ‘in front of the house’.

#### 2.3.7. ‘Back, space behind, time after’


The generic POc term for the back (of something or someone), the space behind (something or someone), and the time after (an event) was _&ast;muri[-]_. However, it has a more complex history than other POc relational nouns. Blust (ACD) derives it from PMP _&ast;ma-udehi_, containing the PMP undergoer-subject verbal prefix _&ast;ma-_ and the root _&ast;udehi_ which he glosses as ‘last; come after or behind; late, later; future; stern of a boat; youngest child.’ Blust’s glosses are not intended to be a claim about the morpholexical class of the item, but it is a reasonable inference from work on the history of PMP and POc _&ast;ma-_ ([Evans and Ross 2001](Source#cldf:EvansandRoss2001)) that PMP _&ast;udehi_ was a noun, perhaps meaning ‘that which is behind, that which is last, that which is after or in the future’ and that _&ast;ma-udehi_ was a stative (adjectival) verb derived from it.

There is evidence in the Gapapaiwa (PT), Ramoaaina (MM), Arosi (SES), Bauan (Fij), Samoan (Pn), and Rennellese (Pn) definitions below that POc _&ast;muri_ remained a stative verb, but there is also overwhelming evidence that it was a monovalent relational noun with spatial meanings like ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after’ as well as more concrete uses like ‘stern of a canoe’. It is also glossed as an adverb of place and/or time in a number of languages, but where there is evidence about its morpholexical class, these uses derive from its nominal use with a preposition, suggesting POc _&ast;i muri_ ‘behind, later’ (more literally, ‘in the space behind, at a time after’). POc _&ast;muri_ thus also had a temporal use, referring to time after the time of speaking (p.322). Note that the syntactic behaviour of POc _&ast;muri[-]_ broadly matches that of its antonym _&ast;muqa[-]_/_&ast;muga_ ([§2.3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-6#cldf:2-8)), which also had both nominal and verbal uses.


<a id="p-261"></a>

It appears that the PMP root _&ast;udehi_ was also inherited into POc as the base _&ast;uri_, but only two reflexes have been found. They are both in NNG languages: Gedaged _uli_ ‘follow, pursue; come after, succeed; go to the rear’ and Kaulong _e-uli-_ ‘back’ (_e-_ ART).

The reflexes below contain a Northwest Solomonic innovation whereby Proto Northwest Solomonic _&ast;mudi[-]_ is reconstructable (this would reflect POc _&ast;mudri_) instead of expected _&ast;&ast;muri[-]_.

[Proto Northwest Solomonic &ast;_mudi-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-3-262-ProtoNorthwestSolomonic-mudi-a)

The semantic and formal similarity of the reflexes of POc _&ast;burit_ below to those of POc _&ast;muri[-]_ above is evidently due to chance. In the 2003 version of this chapter, I attributed members of the set below to a putative PMP _&ast;pa-udehi_, paradigmatically related to PMP _&ast;ma-udehi_ (ancestral to POc _&ast;muri[-]_), but the presence in this set (listed in the ACD) of Bugotu _buriti_ indicates that I was wrong.

<a id="p-263"></a>

One body-part term occurs with fair frequency with the sense of ‘back part of, space behind’. This is POc _&ast;takuRu[-]_ ‘(s.o.’s) back’. The evidence that this was a body-part term in POc is clear. It may also have been used by extension as a POc relational local noun, but it is also possible that local-noun uses in modern languages represent independent parallel developments.

### 2.4. The interrogative local noun ‘where?’


The interrogative local noun ‘where?’ was POc _&ast;pai_. Micronesian reflexes of _&ast;i pai_ reflect Proto Micronesian _&ast;i-fā_ rather than expected _&ast;i-fai_.

[PMP &ast;_pai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-2-4-264-POc-pai-a)


<a id="p-265"></a>

Also found are forms which appear to reflect _&ast;pea_, _&ast;pia_ and, in Polynesian, PPn _&ast;fē_. These probably reflect POc _&ast;pai-a_ (cf. Numbami _aia_, Sursurunga _aiə_, Uruava _veia_ above), together with vowel sequence reductions which have occurred independently but in parallel. The step from POc _&ast;paia_ to _&ast;pea_ is an obvious one. In a number of languages the height distance between the vowels of _&ast;pea_ has been maximised, giving _&ast;pia_. And in Polynesian, an innovation which is regular in Tongic and sporadic in some other Polynesian languages apparently produced _&ast;fē_ as an alternant to _&ast;fea_ (< _&ast;pea_ < _&ast;paia_). The forms are listed below. Where a reconstruction is preceded by a question mark, the forms beneath it may be the result of parallel developments.

## 3. Directional verbs


Directional verbs can be conveniently divided into verbs of __deictic direction__ (‘towards speaker’, ‘towards addressee’, ‘away from speaker and addressee’) and verbs of __geographic direction__, and especially vertical direction (‘go up’, ‘go down’).


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Some Proto Oceanic serial verb constructions


Directional verbs play an important role in certain serial verb constructions in Oceanic languages, and they evidently did so in POc, to judge both from the wide distribution of such constructions today and from grammaticised versions of these constructions ([Ross 2003](Source#cldf:Ross2003)).

Verbs of deictic direction occur in serial verb constructions of deictic direction, where they follow a verb of locomotion (transitive or intransitive) or a verb of geographic direction. The examples below are from Yabem (NNG). In both the first two examples, the deictic directional verb is _-yà_ ‘go away from speaker and addressee’.[^19] In the first example it follows the locomotion verb _-lob_ ‘fly’, in the second the geographic directional verb _-pi_ ‘go up’.


<a id="p-267"></a>

[2-8-3-1-267-9](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-1-267-9)

[2-8-3-1-267-10](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-1-267-10)

Verbs of geographic direction also occur in serial verb constructions of geographic direction, where they follow a locomotion verb (transitive or intransitive). In this example, the locomotion verb is _-pwanɛʔ_ ‘insert’, the geographic directional verb _-sep_ ‘go down’.

[2-8-3-1-267-11](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-1-267-11)

Commonly the two constructions are combined, giving a sequence of locomotion verb, geographic directional verb and deictic directional verb, e.g. _-ne_ ‘sink’, _-sep_ ‘go down’ and _-yà_ ‘go away from speaker and addressee’ in this example.

[2-8-3-1-267-12](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-1-267-12)

Directional verbs, both deictic and geographic, also occur in sequential serial verb constructions, where the first verb is a directional verb expressing ‘go [up/down] and …’ or ‘come and …’, the second a verb expressing the main event of the predication. This example is from Bali (MM):

[2-8-3-1-267-13](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-1-267-13)


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Grammaticisations of serial verb constructions


Directional verbs are grammaticised in a number of ways in Oceanic languages ([Lichtenberk 1991](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1991)). Three of these grammaticisation paths give rise to morphemes expressing location and direction. Reflexes of directional verbs which have undergone these grammaticisations occur in the cognate sets below, and for that reason are described here.

In the first type of grammaticisation, a directional verb in a serial verb construction loses its subject proclitic/prefix and becomes a directional adverbial enclitic (glossed DIR in cogate sets). In the two Sisiqa (MM) examples below, the directional enclitics _=me_ and _=la_ reflect the POc deictic directional verb forms _&ast;ma_ ‘come’ and _&ast;la_ ‘go:2’ ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:2-8)) respectively. Each is preceded by a locomotion verb (‘carry’, ‘walk’), reflecting an earlier serial verb construction of deictic direction.

[2-8-3-2-267-14](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-2-267-14)


<a id="p-268"></a>

In this Manam (NNG) example there is a sequence of locomotion verb (‘take’) and two directional enclitics, _-raʔe_ ‘up, to one’s right when facing sea’ (< geographical directional verb POc _&ast;sake_ ‘go up’, p.273) and _-laʔo_ ‘away’ (< deictic directional verb POc _&ast;lako_ ‘go:3’, p.287) reflecting an earlier three-verb sequence ([Lichtenberk 1983](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1983):576–582).

[2-8-3-2-268-15](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-2-268-15)

In the second type of grammaticisation, described by [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1973) ([1973](Source#cldf:Pawley1973)) and [Durie](Source#cldf:Durie1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Durie1988)), a directional verb in a serial verb construction is reanalysed as a preposition or a relator (see below) and comes to form a constituent primarily with the following locative expression. Prepositional reflexes of POc _&ast;mai_ ‘come’ occur in Polynesian languages. In Samoan, for example, we find ([Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992](Source#cldf:MoselandHovdhaugen1992):147):

[2-8-3-2-268-16](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-2-268-16)

In Meso-Melanesian languages of New Britain and New Ireland and in Longgu (SES), the deictic directional verbs _&ast;mai_ ‘come’ and _&ast;ua_ ‘go:2’ have become respectively ablative and allative relators ([Ross 2003](Source#cldf:Ross2003)). I use the term ‘relator’ for a preposition-like morpheme which differs in its distribution from a preposition in that it precedes either a prepositional phrase or a local noun. This distribution reflects its verbal ancestry: a POc deictic directional verb could be followed by a locative expression consisting of a local noun or a prepositional phrase. Hence in Longgu, vu is the allative relator reflecting &ast;ua:

[2-8-3-2-268-17](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-2-268-17)

In the third, least widespread, grammaticisation type, the deictic directional verb in a sequential serial verb construction becomes a pre-verbal clitic indicating the location or direction of the event in relation to the speech act participants. In the best described case, Sinaugoro (PT) ([Tauberschmidt 1999](Source#cldf:Tauberschmidt1999):31–32), the clitics are enclitics to the preverbal subject/aspect/mood marking complex. In this example =ma reflects POc _&ast;ma_ ‘come’.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Geographic directional verbs and enclitics


Geographic direction verbs occurred both independently and in geographic directional serial verb constructions. From the latter usage, they have often developed into enclitics or adverbs marking geographic direction.


<a id="p-269"></a>

The main semantic domain of geographic direction verbs is that of vertical direction, downward and upward. Vertical direction terms have developed two kinds of secondary meanings in Oceanic languages, and these were probably present in Proto Oceanic. First, ‘downward’ and ‘upward’ often have the secondary horizontal senses ‘to the northwest’ and ‘to the southeast’. Second, because Oceanic speakers often dwell on mountainous islands, in some languages ‘downward’ also means ‘seaward’, and ‘upward’ also means ‘inland’ or, from the sea, ‘landward’.

A pair of antonyms occurred in POc. These were the generic verbs of movement down and up:

|                       |                     |
|:----------------------|:--------------------|
| _&ast;sipo_ ‘go downward’ | _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward’ |

As I noted earlier (p.229), POc apparently had a subsystem of geographic direction which was based on a river valley and had an up/down axis and a transverse axis with one directionally neutral (‘across the valley’) term. The terms used for ‘down the valley’ and ‘up the valley’ were evidently _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_. The transverse term was possibly _&ast;pano_, which also served as a verb of deictic direction and is reconstructed on p.289. However, there are no known Western Oceanic or Southeast Solomonic reflexes of _&ast;pano_ with this sense, so this may be a later innovation.

Recent work by [François](Source#cldf:Francois2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Francois2003), [2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)) suggests strongly that this subsystem was also applied metaphorically to directions at sea. The two cardinal directions at sea were evidently provided by the major winds, POc _&ast;apaRat_, the northwest storm wind, and _&ast;raki_, the southeast trade wind, as the reflexes below (repeated from [Chapter 5, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:2-5)) suggest:

[PMP &ast;_habaRat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-269-POc-aparat-a)

[POc &ast;_raki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-269-POc-raki-a)


<a id="p-270"></a>

After examining the sea-based directional systems of a sample of Oceanic languages, François concludes that in POc ‘go down’ apparently had the secondary sense ‘go northwest’, whilst ‘go up’ had the secondary sense ‘go southeast’. More tentatively, he suggests that _&ast;pano_ may have been used for movement across the northwest–southeast axis. He suggests that the basis of this metaphor was that sailing into the wind felt to the sailors like going uphill.

In [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1995c) ([1995c](Source#cldf:Ross1995c)) I suggested that _&ast;sake_ ‘go up’ and _&ast;sipo_ ‘go down’ were used by POc speakers to denote ‘east’ and ‘west’, i.e. the locations of sunrise and sunset. This inference was based on the fact that the glosses for their reflexes in many Oceanic languages are given as ‘east’ and ‘west’ (this is also true of some of the sources that [François 2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a) cites). However, François argues in his detailed account of Mwotlap directional systems that this is semantically implausible, as reflexes of _&ast;sake_ and _&ast;sipo_ are used for ‘go southeast’ and ‘go northwest’ respectively, and it is hard to see how these meanings — or ‘go east’ and ‘go west’ — could be derived from ‘go to the place where the sun rises/sets’ ([François 2003](Source#cldf:Francois2003)). In [François](Source#cldf:Francois2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)) he also presents the systems of a number of languages which display the ‘go up/southeast’ and ‘go down/northwest’ correlations. I find his reconstruction of a terminological subsystem corresponding to the major wind directions convincing, and I think it likely that systems which are oriented to the rising and setting of the sun are probably more recent developments.

[François](Source#cldf:Francois2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)) is a reconstruction of a POc terminological subsystem, i.e. a system of meanings and the relationships among them. The languages in his sample by no means all use reflexes of _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_ for ‘go downward’ and ‘go upward’, and he makes no attempt to reconstruct the POc forms, assuming that the relevant POc etyma were _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_. I return briefly to the reconstruction of _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_ as directions at sea in [§3.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-3#cldf:2-8) below.


<a id="s-3-3-1"></a>

#### 3.3.1. Downward movement


Three possible verbs of downward movement are reconstructed below. They are:

|     |          |                                 |
|:----|:---------|:--------------------------------|
| POc | _&ast;sipo_  | ‘go down, downwards’            |
| POc | _&ast;sobu_  | ‘go downward, dive down’        |
| POc | _&ast;surup_ | ‘(?) enter, penetrate; go down’ |

The most widely reflected of these is _&ast;sipo_, the generic verb of downward movement. POc &ast;sobu seems also to have carried the meaning ‘dive down’, as several of its reflexes have to do with action in the sea. I also include POc _&ast;surup_ ‘enter, penetrate, go down’ here on account of reflexes with the gloss ‘go down’, but the latter are found only in Meso-Melanesian and Southeast Solomonic languages, and I question whether it had this sense in POc.


<a id="p-271"></a>

[PMP &ast;_surup_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-272-POc-surup-a)

The forms listed below also seem to constitute a cognate set, but, as the questions implicit in the reconstruction _&ast;[s,j]u[(a,u)]_ indicate, their history is not fully understood. The New Caledonian reflexes suggest a contrast between a directional adverbial form in _&ast;j-_ and a verb in _&ast;s-_, but this contrast is not reflected elsewhere in the set.

[POc &ast;_&#91;s,j&#93;u&#91;(a,u)&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-272-POc-sjuau-a)


<a id="p-273"></a>

POc _&ast;wau_ ‘go seawards’ and _&ast;bala_ ‘move downward (?)’ are also tentatively reconstructed, but they are not well supported.

[POc &ast;_wau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-273-POc-wau-a)

[POc &ast;_bala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-273-POc-bala-a)


<a id="s-3-3-2"></a>

#### 3.3.2. Upward movement


The generic verb of upward movement was POc _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward, go southeast’, also used, for example, of boarding a canoe.

[POc &ast;_sake_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-273-POc-sake-a)


<a id="p-274"></a>


<a id="p-275"></a>

Some or all of the forms below probably also reflect POc _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward’, but they all reflect unexplained anomalies. The New Caledonian forms reflect the same contrast between an adverb in _&ast;j-_ and a verb in _&ast;s-_ as was noted above with regard to POc _&ast;[s,j]u[(a,u)]_ ‘go down vertically, fall’.

<a id="s-3-3-3"></a>

#### 3.3.3. _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_ as directions at sea


Above I noted [François’](Source#cldf:Francois2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)) reconstruction of POc speakers’ use of terms for ‘go downward’ and ‘go upward’ for ‘go northwest’ and ‘go southeast’, i.e. directions corresponding with those of the major winds. François assumes that the relevant POc terms were _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_, reconstructed in §[§3.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-1#cldf:2-8)–3.3.2. As these were the generic terms for ‘go downward’ and ‘go upward’, his assumption is probably correct, but it is not particularly well supported by the available data, as the sets below show. In fact, all supporting data for both terms in these meanings come from Eastern Oceanic languages. The Yabem and Motu reflexes of _&ast;sipo_ have ‘wrong’ directions in their glosses. This may mean that this use of &ast;sake and _&ast;sipo_ was an Eastern Oceanic innovation, but it may also mean that insufficient Western Oceanic (and Admiralties) systems have been carefully recorded. In a number of Western Oceanic languages, ‘east’ and ‘west’ are translated as ‘place where the sun rises’ and ‘place where the sun sets’, but these phrasal expressions may be modern renderings of English ‘east’ and ‘west’.

[POc &ast;_sake_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-276-POc-sake-a)

François also alludes to members of the Polynesian sets below. However, these are clearly locative nouns, and may just as well reflect an orientation to sunset and sunrise, as [Biggs](Source#cldf:Biggs1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Biggs1994):25) implies.

[PPn &ast;_si-sifo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-276-PPn-sisifo-a)

[PPn &ast;_sa-sake_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-3-276-PPn-sasake-a)

The important point about François’ reconstruction is that the equation of ‘go downward’ and ‘go upward’ with ‘go northwest’ and ‘go southeast’ occurs widely, suggesting that the equation itself should be reconstructed for POc, even if the forms themselves are hard to reconstruct. Except for Wayan, the terms listed below are drawn from [François](Source#cldf:Francois2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Francois2004a)).

#### 3.3.4. Geographic direction adverbs derived from verbs


In a scattering of Oceanic languages, the verbs POc _&ast;sipo_ ‘go downward’ (p.271) and POc _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward’ (p.273) are also reflected as (or as the roots of) locative and/or allative adverbs. These are distinct from directional adverbials in that they often form part of the locative demonstrative paradigm, with meanings like ‘down below’ and ‘up here’. These reflexes are sufficiently well distributed to arouse the suspicion, at least, that this was also one of their POc functions.

The meanings of the items listed below overlap substantially with reflexes of the POc local nouns _&ast;tanoq_ ‘down below’ (p.241) and POc _&ast;atas_ ‘top; space above’ (p.243). There are also a few reflexes below of _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sake_ which function as nouns, but it seems certain that these are the results of locally restricted developments.

#### 3.4.1. A note on deixis in Oceanic


Proto Oceanic deixis was person-oriented. That is, there were forms with the meanings ‘near speaker’, ‘near addressee’ and ‘distant from both speaker and addressee’. This pattern is well represented in Oceanic demonstrative forms right across the Pacific. Individual languages may lose a member of the paradigm, finishing up with a proximal/distal system. Some languages have reinterpreted the three-way system in terms of orientation to the speaker alone (‘near speaker’ vs ‘an intermediate distance from speaker’ vs ‘far from speaker’), but such languages are by no means as widespread as the person-oriented system. A good many languages have added members to the system, distinguishing, for example, between referents that can and cannot be seen by the speech act participants, or adding a member for referents the speaker points at, but none of these additions can be reconstructed as a POc category.

A reconstruction of POc demonstrative forms is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a sample of person-oriented systems is given below. The forms given are those used adnominally, except where shown (they may also have other language-specific uses).

<a id="p-279"></a>

The person-oriented system of deixis was manifested not only in demonstratives, but also in the system of deictic directional verbs. POc had a system with at least three members: ‘come to[wards] speaker’, ‘go/come to[wards] addressee’ and ‘go to a point away from both speaker and addressee’, glossed here as ‘come’, ‘go:2’ and ‘go:3’ respectively. There were possibly two ‘go:3’ verbs, however. One licensed a location expression, i.e. its basic meaning was ‘go to’. The other simply meant ‘go away (from speaker)’ and did not license a location expression. Thus in Kele (Adm) there is a contrast between _la_ ‘go to’ and _aw_ ‘go away’ ([Ross 2002f](Source#cldf:Ross2002f)). This suggests that POc had a four-member system, and I will assume this here. Against this is the fact that I have found no language in which a four-member system is preserved.

Three-member deictic directional verb systems are found right across Oceania,[^22] and a sample is given below. Some are reflected as directional enclitics, rather than as verbs. It is sometimes difficult to tell from a source whether the third member should be assigned to ‘go:3’ or ‘go away’. However, in languages where deictic directional verbs have become directional enclitics, the ‘go:3’ form has lost its capacity to license a location expression and inevitably means ‘go away’. Note that the two systems from the Admiralties make the contrast between ‘go:3’ and ‘go away’ which supports the reconstruction of a four-member system.

#### 3.4.2. Reconstructing Proto Oceanic deictic directional forms


The main deictic directional forms of POc, which account for the majority of the forms listed above, were as follows:

|         |                | verb                   | directional adverb          |
|:--------|:---------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------------|
| come    | _&ast;mai_, _&ast;ma_  | ‘come’                 | ‘towards speaker’ (p.281)   |
| go:2    | _&ast;ua_          | ‘go towards addressee’ | ‘towards addressee’ (p.283) |
|         | _&ast;watu_        | ‘go towards addressee’ | ‘towards addressee’ (p.286) |
| go:3    | _&ast;lako_, _&ast;la_ | ‘go (to)’              | ‘away from speaker’ (p.287) |
| go away | _&ast;pano_, _&ast;pa_ | ‘go away’              | ‘away from speaker’ (p.290) |


<a id="p-280"></a>

Note that I reconstruct these POc forms as both verbs and directional adverbs. In [§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:2-8) I briefly discussed the grammaticisation of deictic directional verbs as directional adverbs. This process raises the question, Were there already directional adverbs in POc, or are modern Oceanic directional adverbs the outcomes of independent parallel developments? The answer appears to be: both. Directional adverbs are so widespread in Oceanic languages that one may infer that they were already present in POc, otherwise we would not find such a plethora of reflexes of verbs as enclitics in modern Oceanic languages. On the other hand, there are cases where it is clear that the development of the directional adverb is more recent because it reflects not just the verb root but also accretions to it that have occurred in the history of the particular language.[^23] The Sobei (SJ) directional enclitics _-ema_ ‘towards speaker’ and _-ewo_ ‘away from speaker’ transparently reflect the verbs _-ma_ ‘come’ and _-wo_ ‘go’ with a fossilised third person singular subject marker _e-_. The Sye (SV) directional adverb _mpelom_ ‘towards speaker’ is transparently derived from the verb _velom_ ‘come’. This must be a late development, since _ve-lo-m_ seems itself to reflect the concatenation of three roots, _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ ‘go away’, _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ ‘go’, and _&ast;ma_ ‘come; towards speaker’.

Three of the verbs listed above, _&ast;mai_/_&ast;ma_, _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ and _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_, have long and short forms. It is difficult to reconstruct the distribution of the long and short forms with any certainty, as they do not correspond with the division between verb and enclitic. However, there seem to be two contexts in which the short forms may have emerged, both of them in serial verb constructions. One was as the final verb of a deictic directional serial verb construction. The other was as the first verb of a sequential serial verb construction (the gloss V AUX is used to label these below). POc _&ast;watu_ and _&ast;ua_ look superficially like a long/short pair, but they are regionally distributed, unlike the other three pairs (p.286).

Two other verbs seem to have been used as deictic directional verbs, but probably not as directional enclitics, in POc. They are less well attested than the verbs reconstructed above.

|              |           |                                |
|:-------------|:----------|:-------------------------------|
| come         | _&ast;pʷati_  | ‘come’ (p.283)                 |
| go:3/go away | _&ast;[y]aku_ | ‘go (to)’ or ‘go away’ (p.293) |

It is unclear whether _&ast;[y]aku_ meant ‘go (to)’ or ‘go away’.

I also reconstruct the prepositional verb _&ast;tani_ ‘(go) away from’ below (p.293). It was not deictic, but it overlaps semantically with the verbs reconstructed in this section.


<a id="s-3-4-3"></a>

#### 3.4.3. ‘Come towards speaker’


Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _&ast;aRi_, which in its root form was used imperatively as ‘come on’, ‘let’s go’ (Paiwan [Formosan] _ari_ ‘let’s go!’) and apparently survives in the Takia interjection _aria_ with the same meanings.[^24] The indicative form was PAn _&ast;maRi_ ‘come’ (from _&ast;um-aRi_, where _&ast;um_ is the actor focus infix; [vol.1,29](ContributionTable?anchor=p-29#cldf:1-2)), and this form is well reflected in Formosan and WMP languages. However, it seems likely that the variant _&ast;mai_ existed from the earliest times, as Blust notes Favorlang (Formosan) _mai_ and Yami (WMP) _mai_, and that _&ast;mai_ ousted reflexes of _&ast;maRi_ throughout the Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian grouping (e.g. Manggarai, Sikka, Rotinese _mai_) to which POc belonged.


<a id="p-281"></a>

There is just one Oceanic reflex, Mangap (NNG) _-mar_ ‘come towards speaker’, which appears to reflect _&ast;maRi_ rather than _&ast;mai_. However, the fact that Mangap has a distinction between _-mar_ ‘come towards speaker’ and _-ma_ ‘come towards addressee’ suggests that a pre-Mangap reflex of _&ast;ma_ expanded its use from ‘towards speaker’ to ‘towards us, speaker and addressee’, and that a further morpheme, perhaps a demonstrative, was then suffixed to it to disambiguate ‘towards speaker’, giving _-ma-r_.

Also reconstructable is the POc form _&ast;ma_, reflected in WOc and CEOc languages. There is no reconstructable functional distinction between _&ast;-mai_ and _&ast;-ma_, as reflexes of both occur as verbs and as directional enclitics, and both should probably be glossed in POc as (V) ‘come’ and (DIR) ‘towards speaker’. In many languages, a reflex of _&ast;mai_ or _&ast;ma_ occurs as the second element of one or more compounds, and these are taken to be reflexes of an earlier final verb of a serial construction or reflexes of a directional enclitic (it is impossible to tell which). A number of these are listed below.

[PAn &ast;_maRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-281-POc-mai-a)


<a id="p-282"></a>


<a id="p-283"></a>

In a number of languages POc _&ast;mai_/_&ast;ma_ is reflected as a preposition or a relator. However, the reflexes listed below are probably the result of parallel innovations in different groups of languages, and it is unnecessary to reconstruct a preposition or relator usage for POc _&ast;mai_/_&ast;ma_ (cf. [§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:2-8)).

[POc &ast;_mai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-283-POc-mai-a)

One other POc morpheme with the same meanings as _&ast;mai_ may be reconstructable. This is _&ast;pʷati_. Note, however, that most reflexes are in the South New Ireland grouping of MM, and that the POc status of this reconstruction is dependent on the Arosi reflex alone.

<a id="s-3-4-4"></a>

#### 3.4.4. ‘Go towards addressee’


Two alternant forms, POc _&ast;ua_ and _&ast;watu_, mean ‘go towards addressee’, (DIR) ‘towards addressee’.


<a id="p-284"></a>

It is just possible that POc _&ast;ua_ reflects PAn _&ast;kuSa_ ‘go’. However, no reflexes of PAn _&ast;kuSa_ have been found in non-Oceanic languages outside Taiwan,[^28] and it is more likely that the Taiwan and Oceanic sets reflect different etyma, the more so as no member of the Oceanic set reflects PAn _&ast;k-_.

Some of the reflexes of _&ast;ua_ can be confused with those of POc _&ast;pa_ and _&ast;ba_. That there is a contrast between _&ast;pa_ and _&ast;ua_ is attested by the pairs Adzera _fa_ ‘go’ (p.291) and _waʔ-_ ‘go out’ (p.286) and Kiriwina _va_ (PREP, p.292) and _wa_ (VF, below).

[POc &ast;_ua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-284-POc-ua-a)

In a number of languages POc _&ast;ua_ is reflected as a preposition or a relator (cf. [§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:2-8)).

[POc &ast;_ua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-284-POc-ua-b)

Proto South Vanuatu _&ast;un-_, which forms locative nouns from common nouns ([Lynch 2001c](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c):132), may also belong here.


<a id="p-285"></a>

Longgu _vu_ appears to be cognate with forms in the Malaita/Makira subgroup (SES) that reflect Proto Malaita/Makira _&ast;vua_ or _&ast;vuni_. [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1985b) ([1985b](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1985b)) attributes all these forms to POc _&ast;pani_ (V) ‘give’, (PREPV) ‘beneficiary case-marker’. The Malaita/Makira forms certainly have benefactive meanings, but Longgu _vu_ is clearly allative, and the best account of both its form and meaning is given by attributing it to _&ast;ua_ — although this means assuming that initial _&ast;v-_ has arisen by epenthesis. But what are we to do with the Malaita/Makira forms? The best explanation seems to be that there was a conflation of pre-Proto Malaita/Makira _&ast;vua_ ‘allative relator’ (cognate with Longgu _vu_ and reflecting POc _&ast;ua_) and _&ast;vani_ ‘beneficiary prepositional verb’ (reflecting POc _&ast;pani_), resulting in _&ast;vua_ with a benefactive function and _&ast;vuni_ with a form cobbled together from both items but in benefactive function.

This interpretation is supported by the Longgu dative verbal preposition _wini-_, which takes an object pronoun suffix when it governs a first or second person referent, e.g. _wini-o_ DATIVE-O:2SG ‘to you’, but assumes the allomorph _wa-_ with a possessor pronoun suffix when it governs a third person, e.g. _wa-na_ DATIVE-P:3SG ‘to it/him/her’.[^29] As [Hill](Source#cldf:Hill1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Hill1992):245) points out, _wa-_ overlaps semantically with _vu_ (< POc _&ast;ua_). It appears that _wini_ reflects POc _&ast;pani_ and _wa-_ POc _&ast;ua_, but the two form a single paradigm in Longgu. This inference would also explain the non-etymological initial _&ast;v-_ of _vu_: it is inherited from pre-Proto Malaita/Makira _&ast;vua_, where it resulted from ‘infection’ by _&ast;vani_.

The Bauan Fijian forms are tentatively included in the set above. The form _vuā_ again has epenthetic _v-_, but its meaning and the parallel with the prepositional use of _mai_ suggest that it reflects _&ast;ua_. More specifically, _vuā_ apparently reflects pre-Fijian _&ast;vua-i-a_ (go.towards-TR-O:3SG) and means ‘to/for/from/with him/her’. The form _vei_ is more problematic. It may reflect either _&ast;vua-i_ (go.towards-ART) or _&ast;pa-i_ (go.away-ART). Either way, _&ast;i_ is the personal article. Semantically, it is also possibe that _&ast;pani_ ‘give’ has played a role in the history of these forms, as they have a dative function.

Other reflexes of &ast;ua apparently occur as demonstratives in a number of languages.

[POc &ast;_ua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-285-POc-ua-a)

Forms reflecting POc _&ast;watu_ are listed below. It is tempting to reconstruct this as _&ast;uatu_ in view of its probable relationship to _&ast;ua_, discussed below. However, the reflexes listed below point to POc _&ast;watu_, even if this perhaps reflects pre-POc _&ast;uatu_.

Irregular loss of initial _&ast;w-_ is reflected in New Caledonian and Central Pacific (Fij and Pn) languages, which reflect _&ast;atu_ for expected _&ast;&ast;watu_. POc _&ast;w_ is lost regularly in all positions in Hoava and Roviana, word-initially in Gela and Bugotu, and sporadically in Mota and NE Ambae and other NCV languages.

<a id="p-287"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;ua_ and _&ast;watu_ have a distribution which roughly matches major subgroups: _&ast;ua_ is found throughout Western Oceanic, _&ast;watu_ elsewhere. But the distribution is imperfect. Possible reflexes of _&ast;ua_ occur in Southeast Solomonic and Fijian (and apparently as demonstratives in Micronesian). Reflexes of _&ast;watu_ occur in a few Western Oceanic languages. And reflexes of both forms appear in the Admiralties. Despite these imperfections, however, the distribution of the two forms is quite different from that of the other deictic directional verbs, where geography plays no significant role. It seems legitimate to suggest that both forms occurred in POc, and that as POc broke up and diversified, one form or the other tended to win out on an areal basis.

Why did POc have the two forms _&ast;ua_ and _&ast;watu_? Evidently, as hinted by Blust (ACD, under the entry for PAn _&ast;-Cu_ ‘near addressee’), _&ast;watu_ represents an innovation whereby the POc demonstrative morpheme _&ast;-tu_ ‘near addressee’ was added to _&ast;ua_, stretching it to the canonic CVCV shape of POc morphemes. An obvious alternative suggestion is that _&ast;ua_ represents the short form of _&ast;watu_ in the same way as _&ast;ma_ and _&ast;la_ represent the short forms of _&ast;mai_ (p.281) and _&ast;lako_ (see below). This is unlikely, however, as the external evidence indicates that the inherited POc form was _&ast;ua_, and the fairly neat geographic distribution of _&ast;ua_ and _&ast;watu_ is very different from the scattered, interlaced distributions of _&ast;mai_ and _&ast;ma_ and of _&ast;lako_ and _&ast;la_.

#### 3.4.5. ‘Go away to’


Just as POc _&ast;mai_ ‘come’ had a short form _&ast;ma_, so POc _&ast;lako_ ‘go’ had the short form _&ast;la_. Again, reflexes of both occur as verbs and as directional enclitics, and each probably had both functions in POc, viz. _&ast;mai_, _&ast;ma_ glossed as (V) ‘come’ and (DIR) ‘towards speaker’ and _&ast;lako_, _&ast;la_ glossed as (V) ‘go (to)’ and (DIR) ‘away from speaker’. In some languages, a reflex of _&ast;lako_ or _&ast;la_ occurs as the second element of one or more compounds, and these are again taken to be reflexes of an earlier final verb or directional enclitic.

[PMP &ast;_lako_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-287-POc-lako-a)


<a id="p-288"></a>

It is reasonable to expect that the processes that have created prepositions and relators from the deictic direction verbs _&ast;mai_/_&ast;ma_ ‘[come] towards speaker’ and _&ast;ua_ ‘[go] towards addressee’ may also have created them from _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ ‘go (to)’, (DIR) ‘away from speaker’. Although there are a good many prepositional reflexes, many of them are problematic because they have more than one possible source. In the set below, it is probable that some items reflect POc _&ast;lalo-_, _&ast;lo-_, _&ast;la-_ (N LOC) ‘inside’ rather than POc _&ast;lako_, _&ast;la_ ‘go (to)’, (DIR) ‘away from speaker’.

Formally, items reflecting _&ast;lo_ presumably reflect _&ast;lo-_, one of the short forms of _&ast;lalo-_. It is tempting to attribute all forms reflecting _&ast;la_ to the short form of _&ast;lako_, but there is evidence against this. In Lihir (MM), _la_ is a short form of _lilie-_ ‘inside’ (reflecting _&ast;lalo-_), as we find phrases like the one below where _la_ must be a (relational) noun:

[2-8-3-4-289-19](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-289-19)

Semantically, all the reflexes listed above are locative, which sits better with a derivation from _&ast;lalo-_ ‘inside’ than one from _&ast;lako_ ‘go (to)’, from which one would expect an allative. But it is possible that some reflexes represent a conflation of the two etyma.


<a id="s-3-4-6"></a>

#### 3.4.6. ‘Go away’


POc _&ast;pano_, reconstructed below, perhaps had two uses. Firstly, it was a deictic directional verb meaning ‘go away (from speaker), depart’. Evidence for this meaning is also widespread in non-Oceanic languages (Blust, ACD). Reflexes of both _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ and _&ast;pano_ occur as directional enclitics with the meaning ‘away from speaker’. However, there is evidence that as verbs they had different meanings. Most verbal reflexes of _&ast;lako_ ‘go (to)’ have a valency which implies or requires a destination (expressed, for example, as a prepositional phrase), whilst those of _&ast;pano_ are intransitive.


<a id="p-290"></a>

As noted in [§3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3#cldf:2-8), some reflexes of POc _&ast;pano_ indicate that it was also a geographic directional verb meaning ‘move in a transverse direction’, contrasting with ‘go up, go inland’ and ‘go down, go seawards’. However, it is not entirely clear whether this usage occurred in POc. On one hand, there is a non-Oceanic reflex with this meaning, namely Aralle-Tabulahan (South Sulawesi) _pano_ (DIR) ‘along the level’ ([McKenzie 1997](Source#cldf:Mckenzie1997)). On the other hand, within Oceanic the meaning ‘move in a transverse direction’ is reflected only in North–Central Vanuatu and New Caledonian languages. There are two interpretations of these data: either there were independent parallel innovations in South Sulawesi and Remote Oceanic, or this usage was inherited into POc but happens to have been lost in Western Oceanic and Southeast Solomonic.

[PMP &ast;_panaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-290-POc-pano-a)

The Harua form _mano_ appears to reflect the application of the PMP Actor focus morpheme _&ast;‹um›_ to the root _&ast;panaw_ ([vol.1,29](ContributionTable?anchor=p-29#cldf:1-2)), suggesting that an alternation between _&ast;pano_ and _&ast;mano_ may have survived in POc.


<a id="p-291"></a>

POc _&ast;pano_ evidently had a short form _&ast;pa_, giving a pair analogous to _&ast;mai_/_&ast;ma_ and _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ (pp.281, 287).

[POc &ast;_pa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-291-POc-pa-a)

The meanings of reflexes of _&ast;pa_ agree with those of _&ast;pano_, and the function of the Motu, Sinaugoro,[^32] Gela, and Mota reflexes of _&ast;pa_ (in three different subgroups) as a preverbal auxiliary is similar to that of the Sinaugoro reflexes of _&ast;ma_ and _&ast;la_ above. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) notes that Nguna _vā_ ‘go’ is also described as a short form of _vano_. [Paton](Source#cldf:Paton1973) ([1973](Source#cldf:Paton1973)) describes Lonwolwol _va_ as a short form of _van_ ‘go, pass’, and therefore as a reflex of POc _&ast;pano_, but Blust (ACD) argues that his inference is unjustified since original medial nasals are otherwise retained in Lonwolwol. If, however, _va_ reflects POc _&ast;pa_, the objection disappears.

This leaves a loose end. Blust (ACD) takes the cognate set above to reflect PCEMP _&ast;ba_ ‘go, go away, walk’. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)), on the other hand, infers that the set above and PCEMP _&ast;ba_ are etymologically separate. It is true that the forms attributed to POc _&ast;pa_ above could reflect PCEMP _&ast;ba_: there is no phonological objection to this. But there are just a few Oceanic forms which reflect a POc locomotion verb _&ast;ba_ ‘go’ (Tolai [MM] _ba_ ‘tread, go’, Talise [SES] _ba_ ‘go’), and it seems likely that this _&ast;ba_ reflects PCEMP _&ast;ba_, whilst POc _&ast;pa_ is the short form of _&ast;pano_.

There are a number of apparent prepositional reflexes of _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ ‘go away’, but most are very problematic, as there are two other possible sources of the items listed.


<a id="p-292"></a>

These are POc _&ast;pani_ ‘give’, (PREPV) ‘benefactive’ and PWOc _&ast;pʷa_ (PREP) ‘instrumental, comitative’.[^33] There is also evidence of conflation.

The clearest piece of evidence that _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ played a role in the history of some of the items in the set below is that Hoava _pa_ behaves as a relator, i.e. it occurs before a preposition.

[2-8-3-4-292-20](examplegroups.csv#cldf:2-8-3-4-292-20)

Relators reflect erstwhile deictic directional verbs ([Ross 2003](Source#cldf:Ross2003)), and so _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ is the most likely candidate for the ancestor of Hoava _pa_. Other probable straightforward reflexes of _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ are the Kiriwina, Roviana and Nguna forms, and perhaps the Label locative preposition _ha_, as it contrasts with instrumental _pa_ (from PWOc _&ast;pʷa_).

The NNG items below, all from the Vitiaz Strait area, probably reflect conflation of the POc benefactive prepositional verb _&ast;pani_ and a PWOc instrumental preposition _&ast;pʷa_ ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):106–108, 112–115).

Bound items below are shown with the suffix paradigm that they take, one of object (O:), disjunctive (D:) or possessor (P:). The gloss of each item is formulated as carefully as the data allow, but should not be treated too seriously, as there are likely to be gaps in the glosses.

Functionally and semantically the members of the small cognate set below resemble reflexes of POc _&ast;lako_, but phonologically they do not reflect it. The medial consonant is reconstructed on the basis of Yabem low tone, which reflects the loss of a Proto Huon Gulf voiced obstruent, probably either _&ast;v_ or _&ast;ɣ_, lenis reflexes of POc _&ast;p_ or _&ast;k_. Of these, both are lost intervocalically in Takia, but only _&ast;k_ is lost in the Admiralties languages.

#### 3.4.7. ‘Away from a specified point’


POc _&ast;tani_ was a prepositional verb, reconstructed by [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1973) ([1973](Source#cldf:Pawley1973)). It was not deictic, i.e. not oriented with regard to speaker or hearer, and so strictly does not belong here. It was transitive, and the object of the verb was the point of orientation from which movement takes place. I include it because its reflexes have become deictic directional adverbs in a few languages.

A note on sources

## Notes

[^1]: I am very grateful to John Lynch for his help and advice in interpreting data from New Caledonian languages, to Alexandre François for sharing with me his work on Oceanic marine directions, and to Andrew Pawley for his comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

[^2]: Note that two morphosyntactic categories were used to express the vertical dimension in POc: local nouns and directional verbs.

[^3]: The distribution of these forms is not clear. Perhaps _&ast;e_ was the POc phrase-initial form, _&ast;i_ the phrase-internal form. It is also possible that the POc form was simply _&ast;i_, and that this, like the preposition _&ast;i_ ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:2-8)), has independently become _e_ in a number of languages.

[^4]: Taiof _cina-nai_ reflects POc _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ + _&ast;ña_ ‘3SG possessor’ + Taiof _aye_ ‘3SG free pronoun’.

[^5]: [Crowley](Source#cldf:Crowley1985) ([1985](Source#cldf:Crowley1985)) suggests that human common nouns had no article. This was apparently true of kin terms, but perhaps not of non-kin human common nouns, as an article is reconstructable in this context in Proto Eastern Oceanic ([Pawley 1972](Source#cldf:Pawley1972)).

[^6]: Longgu _-i_ marks a referential noun as singular.

[^7]: The suffix _-ña_ agrees in person and number with _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘house’.

[^8]: Evidence for reconstructing the sequence _&ast;i ta-_ is found in Mussau (Adm) _e ta-gi_ ‘to me, for me’, Gela _i ta-gua_ ‘with me’ (both reflecting POc _&ast;i ta-gu_) and in a Longgu (SES) paradigm of prepositions and relators shown on p.5 ([Hill 1992](Source#cldf:Hill1992)). Paradigmaticity indicates that the cell now occupied by _ta-_ once contained _&ast;i ta-_. Proto South Vanuatu _&ast;ira-_ ([Lynch 2001c](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c)) appears from its possessive suffixation and its uses as general and possessive preposition also to reflect POc _&ast;i ta-_, but this entails assuming the form underwent an idiosyncratic innovation, as it reflects POc _&ast;ira-_.

[^9]: Abbreviations used in glosses are as follows: 1, 2, 3 first, second and third persons; ADN adnominal; ADV adverb; ART article; AUX auxiliary; COM common; CSTR construction marker; D: disjunctive pronoun; DEM demonstrative; DIR direction, directional; E exclusive; ENCL enclitic; HYP hypothetical; I inclusive; IMPF imperfective; IRR irrealis; LOC local, locative; N noun; O: object pronoun; PERS personal; PL plural; P: possessor pronoun; PLC placename; PREP preposition; PREPV prepositional verb; PRO pronoun; R relator; REAL realis; REL relative clause marker; SEQ sequential; SG singular; S: subject pronoun; V verb; VF final verb.

[^10]: Tabar and Lengo sentences are from my fieldnotes.

[^11]: Some of these titles, like ‘inside’, show categorial ambiguity between noun and preposition because the English preposition reflects the grammaticisation of a relational noun.

[^12]: Initial _e-_ reflects the POc local preposition _&ast;i_. Final _-e_ is also found on another Mussau relational noun, _pak-e_, reflecting POc _&ast;pak_ ‘underside’. Its origin is not known.

[^13]: Yabem _m̀_ (syllabic low-tone bilabial nasal) is the regular reflex of earlier _&ast;vu_ < POc _&ast;puqu-_.

[^14]: Blust also gives ‘plank’ as a gloss. See text.

[^15]: The PMP etymon is discussed at length by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a)) and in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995).

[^16]: This putative item resembles POc _&ast;ruku-_ ‘underneath’, but this is probably fortuitous.

[^17]: There are non-Oceanic items that look cognate, but they are descended from borrowings of Sanskrit _mukha_ ‘face’. The items are Isneg _múkāt_ ‘face’, Ilokano _mukat_ ‘eye mucus’, Tagalog _mukhaʔ_, Indonesian _muka_ ‘face’, Balinese _muə_ ‘face’. Sasak _mua_ ‘face’ ([Gonda 1973](Source#cldf:Gonda1973):104). I am grateful to Robert Blust for this information.

[^18]: Blust (ACD) does not provide a gloss for _&ast;ma-udehi_. The gloss here is based on that for _&ast;udehi_.

[^19]: Deictic direction verbs are glossed ‘come’ (move to(wards) speaker), ‘go:2’ (move to(wards) hearer) and ‘go:3’ (move to(wards) a third person or place).

[^20]: A possible non-Oceanic cognate is Kéo (CMP) _ndua_ ‘go down’. The fact that some items here are simply glossed ‘(sun) set’ may be an artifact of data collection. They may well denote downward movement more generally.

[^21]: The two Notsi ablative adverbs form a paradigm with the locative/allative adverbs _bi-lū_ ‘down below, downward’ and _ti-lū_ ‘to the west, westward’. It is unclear to me how to interpret the _-dū_/_-lū_ contrast historically, and this may indicate that _-dū_ does not reflect POc _&ast;jua_.

[^22]: There are also a fair number of languages that have reduced the three-member system to a two-member system of ‘come to[wards] speaker’ and ‘go away (from speaker)’. The latter is usually descended from one of ‘go:2’, ‘go:3’ or ‘go away (from speaker)’.

[^23]: For a more detailed examination of this issue, see [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley2003b) ([2003b](Source#cldf:Pawley2003b)).

[^24]: The interjection _aria_ is widespread in Melanesia, and it is impossible to track its history accurately.

[^25]: This is an enclitic to the preverbal tense/aspect/mood marker. It marks the location of the action relative to the speaker and addressee. To judge from its preverbal position, it reflects the use of a deictic direction verb with the sense ‘come and …’ in the initial slot of a sequential serial verb construction.

[^26]: In Taiof the first/second person object marker, except for first person inclusive plural, is _-ma_. I suspect this was originally the ‘towards speaker’ directional. (The third person/first person inclusive plural form is _-i[ñ]_.)

[^27]: These forms occurs as a fossil in _van-ai_ ‘move across towards deictic centre’ (cf _vano_ ‘move across’), _ha-mai_ ‘move upwards towards deictic centre’ (_hage_ ‘move upwards’) and _hi-mei_ ‘move downwards towards deictic centre’ (_hivo_ ‘move upwards’).

[^28]: Supporting data given by [Tsuchida](Source#cldf:Tsuchida1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Tsuchida1976):235) are Kanakanavu _m-u-á-kusa_ ‘go’, Tsou _uso_ ‘go forward’, Saaroa _m-aɬu-kua_ ‘go where?’, Puyuma _mu-kuwaʔ_ ‘go’, Thao _m-úʃaʔ_ ‘go’, Pazeh _mu-husaʔ_ ‘go’, Atayal, Seediq _(m)usaʔ_ ‘go’, Rukai _(m)wa_ ‘go’.

[^29]: The possessor pronoun suffix was apparently acquired by analogy with the preposition _ta-_.

[^30]: This is an enclitic to the preverbal tense/aspect/mood marker. It marks the location of the action relative to the speaker and addressee. To reflects the use of _&ast;la_ with the sense ‘go and …’ in the initial slot of a sequential serial verb construction.

[^31]: It is possible that Iaai _hããŋ_ does not belong here but is cognate with PPn _&ast;aŋe_ ‘along; away from speaker and addressee’

[^32]: Unlike Sinaugoro _-ma_ ‘towards speaker’ and _-a_ ‘away from speaker’, which still survive as preverbal auxiliaries, Sinaugoro _va_ occurs only in lexicalised compounds.

[^33]: As well as the data given here, the reconstruction of _&ast;pʷa_ is supported by three Meso-Melanesian reflexes from New Ireland which only have instrumental and comitative uses: Tigak _pe_, _pa-_P:, Kara _pa-_P: (both instrumental, comitative), and Label _pa_ (comitative). The PWOc instrumental preposition _&ast;pʷa_ was reconstructed for some interstage later than POc as _&ast;pa_ by [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):106).

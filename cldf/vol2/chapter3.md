## 1. Introduction


This chapter and the following one are an attempt to discover something of the way in which Proto Oceanic speakers experienced and conceptualised their environment. We begin by giving examples taken from the ethnographic literature of how several different Oceanic-speaking peoples describe parts of their environment. We then examine evidence, provided by cognate sets and lexical reconstructions, concerning details of the inanimate land environment known to speakers of Proto Oceanic and certain of its daughter languages. We deal first with the land and landforms, and include vegetation cover only when it is part of a topographical feature.[^1] Seascape is dealt with in the following chapter.

[Malinowski](Source#cldf:Malinowski1922) ([1922](Source#cldf:Malinowski1922), [1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935)) has provided us with a detailed account of the Kiriwina people of the Trobriand Islands, a coral atoll system consisting of one big island (Kiriwina), two of moderate size, and a number of smaller ones surrounding a shallow lagoon. Kiriwina is flat, with no hills or mountains. The Kiriwina word for ‘mountain’ is _koya_, usually in reference to distant mountains on D’Entrecasteaux Islands occasionally visible in the south. Malinowski’s description of the settled environment is centred on an origin myth ‘hole of emergence’ [_bwala_], which is the basis of their land tenure system. Terms or descriptions in square brackets have been added from elsewhere in the text.

> With such a hole of emergence there is always connected a village [_valu_], or part of a village, and a territory, or what we might call an assortment of lands, both of which belong to the people who came out of the hole. As a rule this comprises some waste land [_kaibutia_ ‘barren land, useless for gardening’], a tabooed grove or two [_boma_], a portion of the _rayboag_ [the narrow coral ridge] and perhaps one or two fields in the _dumya_ ([inland] swamps); in every case it includes a large portion of cultivable bush (_odila_), divided into a number of fields [_kubila_], which are subdivided into plots. Those villages which are near the open sea own a part of the eastern seashore (_momola_) with a fishing and bathing beach and a few sheds for their canoes. On the lagoon the beach is called _kavolawa_ and here canoes are kept. Thus a hole of emergence is always the centre of a contingent territory which encloses a village or part of it, and affords the following economic opportunities to its members: access to fertile, cultivable soil, invariably; at times access to navigation and fishing areas; a certain district for recreation and, of course, a system of roads communicating with other villages. (1935:343)


<a id="p-36"></a>

A second example is from Edvard Hviding’s _Guardians of Marovo Lagoon_, an account of the way of life of the Marovo speaking people from New Georgia in the western Solomons ([Hviding 1996](Source#cldf:Hviding1996)). The lagoon itself is vast, a largely enclosed area of shallow sea strewn with islands and reef patches and rimmed by barrier reef islands. It lies on the eastern edge of a high volcanic island covered in lush tropical rainforest and fringed with mangrove swamps. For their livelihood the people depend on a system of shifting agriculture and marine fishing. ‘Important dietary supplements are provided by hunting, focused on feral pigs, birds and marsupials in the rainforest, and by gathering shellfish from the reefs and mangroves, as well as nuts, fruits and leafy greens from garden fallows and forests’ (p.42). The main zones of local environmental classification are shown in [Figure 2](#fig-2-2). They represent the _puava_ or ancestral territories of a kinship group (_butubutu_) to which Marovo people belong. _Puava_ has both a restricted sense, ‘soil, ground’ and a general one, the latter encompassing the total ancestral estate, reaching ‘from the peaks and ridges of the mainland upper mountains to the open sea outside the barrier reef’ (p.137).

The next two examples are from Malaita in the Southeast Solomons. Walter Ivens writes about the salt-water people of Lau and Sa’a, two environments not unlike the Marovo one above, with both descriptions being limited to the land close to the coast that is used intensively. One is a description of the Lau people who live on artificially constructed islands in the Lau lagoon. Fishing forms the basis of their subsistence. Although the islands themselves have no cultivable land, the people have access to limited adjacent land on Malaita for their gardens. Ivens writes (1930:266):


<a id="p-37"></a>

> Land in the vicinity of the beach is called _hara_. Flat sandy land just above the beach is called _nuu_. Breadfruit and certain other fruit trees grow there. The lower foothills are known as _fafo asi_ (lit. ‘above the sea’), and it is there that people have their taro gardens. Garden ground, as distinct from uncleared forest, is called _gano_; _gano alu_ is old garden ground that is not yet ready for planting, ground … that has not yet been rested sufficiently. Virgin forest is _kʷaena_.

Ivens’ second example is that of Sa’a, and its close neighbour, Ulawa, in the south-east of Malaita. The two share an almost identical language. Ivens writes (1927 [reissued 1972]:357–358):

> The sandy soil just above the beach is called _uluone_ [_ulu_ ‘head’ + _one_ ‘sand’], and on this soil the coconuts grow best … At the back of this tract of sandy soil is the _pwainaa_, subject to flooding and with a black soil … The fruit trees abound in this tract. Ulawa calls the upper part of this by the name _akohu_; it is less wet in character. The land rises immediately behind the _pwainaa_ … to the next district, _pwaʔu_. The meaning of this word is ‘smoke’ … At Sa’a, the upper division of _pwaʔu_ is called _lapwa_, from the undergrowth there of the fern of the same name. The land up higher still is called in Sa’a _ano mola_ [‘earth’ + ‘only’, i.e. earth with no rocks or stones], and in Ulawa _kalona_ … Another term applied to the sandy soil of the old beaches is _ʔoʔu_. In some places the land immediately under the first ridge of upheaved coral rocks is called _ote_; the trees in the _ote_ grow to a very large size, especially the teak, _nau_, and the _awa_, Nephelium pinnatum. The _ote_ ground is generally wet owing to soakage from the hills.

Our last example is of the small high island of Tikopia, as described by Raymond Firth in his volume _We, the Tikopia_ (1957). Tikopia is one of the Polynesian outliers, lying northeast of the Banks and Torres Islands, Vanuatu. In form it is a small, compact oval roughly four kilometres by three, and at the time of Firth’s fieldwork in 1928–29 it supported a population of just under 1300. It is likely that every surface feature of any significance would be known in detail. Firth provides two maps, reproduced here as [Map 8](#map-2-8)(a), showing topographical features, and [Map 8](#map-2-8)(b), which shows settlement features such as villages, springs and tracks.

From [Map 8](#map-2-8)(a) we can see that the mountains in the north of the island are simply _Mauŋa_, ‘mountain’, with the bulk of the tallest, Reani, labelled _Mauŋa Lasi_ (‘great mountain’). The crest itself is termed _Te Uru o te Fenua_ (‘the head of the land’) (p.27). The large lake in the centre of the island, a former crater lake and not a lagoon, is simply _Te Roto_ (literally ‘middle, interior’), or more familiarly _Te Vai_ (‘fresh water’) (p.23). Firth explains that the water is fresh because the apparent channel linking the lake to the sea is normally silted up, but may be dug out at certain seasons of the year when the lake is full from rain and the tide is high, to allow excess lake waters to flow down to the sea (p.25). The sand bar separating the lake from the sea on its eastern side is _Te Koro_ (‘barrier of sand or stone against the sea’). Two rocky pinnacles which are all that remain of the former eastern wall of the crater, are _Foŋa te Koro_ (‘top of the Koro’) and _Foŋa Nuku_ (‘top of the settlement’). Breaks in the reef which enable canoes to pass to the open ocean are simply _Te Ava_ (‘channels in the reef’). A large rock off the west coast is _Fatu roa_ (‘tall rock’), while two small rocky outcrops in the east are _Rua motu_ (‘two islets’). Sometimes included in place names are modifying terms like _tua_ ‘back’, _tafa_ ‘side’, _foŋa_ ‘top, crown’ and _muri_ ‘behind’. There are a number of springs named in both maps. These are referred to as _Vai_ followed by a diferentiating name. The swampy area to the south is _Te Ropera_, a word whose etymology, Firth suggests (p.332) is _roto pela_ [or _pera_], literally ‘middle mud’. Along the northern coast are cliffs, _mato_, (p.27) and caves or rock shelters, _ana_ (p.23) (these last not shown on the map).


<a id="p-38"></a>

On [Map 8](#map-2-8)(b) are names which loosely denote localities or districts, treated by Firth as proper names. For _Ravenga_ and _Faea_, the two major divisions of the island, we can offer no explanation. But for three others, _Namo_, the point at which the lake exits to the sea, _Uta_ at the western edge of the lake, and _Tai_, the flat plain of alluvial soil in the south which is largely taken up by swamp, we can posit POc origins based on their physical nature (_&ast;namo_ ‘lagoon; enclosed water’, _&ast;qutan_ ‘bushland, hinterland’, _&ast;tasik_ ‘sea, salt water’).

In his discussion of land tenure (p.332), Firth refers to the _tofi_, areas of mixed woodland and clearing of varying size for which he adopts the translation ‘orchard’. Then there are the _vao_, open stretches of ground which are planted in taro, which he refers to as ‘gardens’. Paths, _ara_, run through orchards and gardens.

Although these examples include many terms for which we can find no cognates, the features they label have much in common. They represent the places where most of the daily activities of their inhabitants are centred, from the forested areas where they hunt, to garden land in its various stages, to coastal swamp and sand, to the lagoon and reef, to islands and the open sea beyond.

A number of the nouns reconstructed in this chapter and the next functioned as both common nouns and as local nouns, as their modern reflexes continue to do. For example, _&ast;qutan_ as a common noun denoted the bush or bushland, while its local-noun use in the prepositional phrase _&ast;i qutan_ could have either the expected sense ‘in the bush’ or the directional sense ‘(up) inland’. For further discussion and reconstruction of local-noun senses, see [Chapter 8, §2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:2-8).

The rest of this chapter is organised under the following headings: land mass, coastal features, inland topographical features, land defined by vegetation, inland water features, mineral substances, fire, and destructive natural events. Details of seascape will be dealt with in Chapter 4.


<a id="s-2"></a>

## 2. Land mass



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Land, mainland


Reflexes of both POc _&ast;panua_ ([vol.1,62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:1-3)) and _&ast;tanoq_[^2] are widely used to refer to the extent or physical state (rocky, flat, dry etc.) of the land, and may also be used to contrast land with sea. The two reconstructions, however, differed in their broader meanings. POc _&ast;panua_ had several senses, outlined below, while POc _&ast;tanoq_ referred particularly to ground or soil. Large islands, the major land masses of a region, are often denoted by reflexes of _&ast;panua_, and this term appears in proper names for major islands, e.g. _Hanua To’o_ ‘San Cristobal’ (lit. ‘solid land’), as used in Arosi, of the Southeast Solomons, _Vanua Levu_ and _Vanua Balavu_ (lit. ‘big land’ and ‘long land’) in Fijian. Note also the Tongan form _fonua lahi_ (lit. ‘big land’) for ‘mainland’. In ’Are’are, the land–sea contrast is expressed in _riu i hanua_ ‘travel overland’ and _riu i āsi_ ‘travel by sea’. In Arosi, the land is either _henua hū_ or _ano hū_ (_hū_ ‘dry’) while the sea _is asi_. In nearby Sa’a the contrast is between _ano hū_ ‘dry land’ and _esi_ ‘sea’.

[PMP &ast;_banua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-2-1-40-POc-panua-a)


<a id="p-41"></a>

POc _&ast;tanoq_ ‘earth, ground, soil; land’ has already been reconstructed in [vol.1,119](ContributionTable?anchor=p-119#cldf:1-5), as a term relevant to horticulture. As a common noun its denotations ranged from the soil beneath one’s feet to the total land mass on which one lived. Besides its use as a common noun, it was also used as a local noun with meanings like ‘down on the ground, down below’ ([Ch.8, §2.2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-5#cldf:2-8)).

[PMP &ast;_taneq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-2-1-41-POc-tanoq-a)

The term _&ast;tanoq_ disappears in Fiji and Polynesia, where the concept of ‘earth, soil’ is denoted by reflexes of PCP _&ast;gʷele_, PPn _&ast;kele_ (see [§7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6#cldf:2-3)).


<a id="p-42"></a>


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Island


Two POc terms are glossed ‘island’. These were probably reserved for small islands. Of our reconstructions, it seems that _&ast;nusa_ was a common noun in POc, but Southeast Solomonic, Fijian and Polynesian reflexes seem to reflect _&ast;qa-nusa_, with the local adverb formative _&ast;qa-_ ([Ch.8, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:2-8)). The expected meaning of _&ast;qa-nusa_ is something like ‘at our own island’, and this is in accord with the use of its reflexes in placenames. The Micronesian reflexes, however, suggest that the prefixed form has also come to be used as a common noun.

[PMP &ast;_nusa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-2-2-42-POc-nusa-a)

Anuta, the name of a very small Polynesian island near Tikopia, is probably also cognate.

The primary role of _&ast;motus_ in POc appears to have been as a stative verb, ‘be broken off, severed’ (see [vol.1,247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:1-9) for likely derivation from PMP _&ast;utus_ ‘break under tension’). _&ast;motus_ may have been applied only to islets, isolated rocks and detached reefs, and not to larger islands more suitable for habitation.

[POc &ast;_motus_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-2-2-42-POc-motus-a)


<a id="p-43"></a>

Cognates of PWOc _&ast;(s,t)imuR_ (below) may reflect POc _&ast;timu(R)_ ‘wind bringing light rain’ (from PMP _&ast;timuR_ ‘south or east wind’) (cf. [Ch. 5, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:2-5)). Waruno Mahdi suggests (pers. comm.) that there has been semantic drift from wind to cloud to cloud over island, a traditional navigator’s way of locating islands. Alternatively, there may be an unrelated word, at least in PWOc:

[PWOc &ast;_(s,t)imuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-2-2-43-PWOc-stimur-a)

Although the next reconstructed form is traceable back to PMP as a verb, its use as a noun is a later development, with its application to a chain of islands apparent only in the Central Pacific.

## 3. Coastal features


This section treats named features of the coastal landscape other than shore reefs and tides, which are dealt with in the next chapter.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Beach, shore


Two POc reconstructions can be made for ‘beach’. One, _&ast;qone_, seems primarily to have meant ‘sand’, but the sense ‘sandy beach’ is also quite widely reflected (see [§7.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-5#cldf:2-3)). The other reconstruction, _&ast;biker_, is less firmly based. However, it is possible that the terms from Huon Gulf languages listed below may also be reflexes. If they are, then the reconstruction should be _&ast;bʷiker_.

[POc &ast;_(b,bʷ)iker_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-1-44-POc-bbiker-a)


<a id="p-45"></a>

The reflexes of POc _&ast;nuku_ are semantically diverse, ranging from ‘sand’, ‘sandbar at river mouth’, ‘island’, and ‘settlement’ to ‘land, country’. However, the agreement between the Southeast Solomonic languages and Bauan Fijian indicates that POc _&ast;nuku_ referred to sandy ground. It may have been used figuratively for land or settlement, especially in place names, bearing in mind that settlements are often located on flat sandy ground just above the beach.

[POc &ast;_nuku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-1-45-POc-nuku-a)

Coastlines, particularly island coastlines, may be characterised as ‘windward coast’ or ‘leeward coast’ in latitudes where tradewinds blow for most of the year. Marovo (MM), for instance, has parallel terms for the ocean-facing side of a barrier island, _kale-lupa_ (_kale_ ‘side’, _lupa_ ‘the beaches, reefs and seascape on the outer or windward side of the barrier reef’) and the lagoon-facing side, _kale-kogu_ (_kogu_ ‘lagoon’). Roviana (MM) refers to the ocean side of an island as _vuragarena_, which [Waterhouse](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949)) contrasts with _tutupeka_. Kia (MM) adapts body part terms for ‘back’ and ‘belly’, _taguru-mo_ ‘windward side of island’ and _tia-mo_ ‘leeward side of island’. Sa’a (SES) has _asi matawa_ ‘weather shore’ and _asi mae_ ‘lee shore’.


<a id="p-46"></a>

In Chapter 4 we have reconstructed PEOc _&ast;tasik maquri(p)_ ‘open sea; ocean on the weather side; weather shore’ (literally ‘live sea’) and PEOc _&ast;tasi mate_ ‘sheltered sea, lee shore’ (literally ‘dead sea’), terms which, from their reflexes, may apply both to the sea or to the affected coastline.

The reconstruction below, PEOc _&ast;liku_, is glossed ‘windward side’, but it seems likely that its reflexes are members of a larger set reflecting PMP _&ast;likuD_, POc _&ast;liku(r)_ ‘person’s back’ whose reflexes are used in a number of languages with the senses ‘back of s.t.’, ‘outside’ ([Ch.8, §2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:2-8)). The use of reflexes of this term for ‘windward side’ reflects the fact that the outside of a barrier reef is its windward side.

[PROc &ast;_liku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-1-46-PROc-liku-a)

Similarly, terms located for the leeward or sheltered side include reflexes of an apparently more general term, PMP _&ast;duŋduŋ_, POc _&ast;ruru_.

[PMP &ast;_duŋduŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-1-46-POc-ruru-a)

References to ‘shore’ occur also in locative expressions (see Chapter 8). To a person at sea, reflexes of POc _&ast;qutan_ will refer to the shore, while to a person inland, reflexes of _&ast;laur_ can carry the same interpretation.


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Bay


The gloss of our next reconstruction, POc _&ast;tobʷa_ is soundly based for PEOc, but depends for promotion to POc on reinterpretation of the name given to the barrier reef islands which enclose Marovo Lagoon. POc _&ast;tobʷa_ is also the reconstructed form for ‘belly, stomach, bag’ and it is possible that ‘bay’ is a metaphorical extension of the term.

[POc &ast;_tobʷa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-2-46-POc-toba-a)


<a id="p-47"></a>

The next set has specific reference to ‘bay’ only in Polynesia. As a POc term, it is a verb used descriptively.

[POc &ast;_paŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-2-47-POc-paa-a)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. River mouth


Polynesian languages use a compound for the mouth of a river, with elements derived from POc forms _&ast;muri_ ‘behind’ + _&ast;waiR_ ‘river, fresh water’.

[PPn &ast;_muri-wai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-3-47-PPn-muriwai-a)

No POc reconstruction is available for ‘river mouth’. This concept was probably named by a compound connecting ‘river’ or ‘fresh water’ with a body part. The most widespread label is ‘leg’ or more likely, ‘foot of river’, and this may well reflect a POc collocation. We find:

[2-3-3-3-47-nng-maposbuang-belvaa](cf.csv#cldf:2-3-3-3-47-nng-maposbuang-belvaa)


<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Cape, prominent land



<a id="p-48"></a>

POc terms that can be glossed ‘cape, headland’ are all words for a body part or part of an object conceived of as similar in shape. The first is _&ast;(i,u)cuŋ_ ‘nose’. It seems likely that PCP _&ast;uju_, which refers to ‘projecting or exposed land’ also reflects POc _&ast;ucuŋ_ ‘nose’.

The suffixed _-a_ of PPn _&ast;utu-a_ below reflects the POc locative nominalising suffix _&ast;-an_ ([vol.1,33](ContributionTable?anchor=p-33#cldf:1-2)–34).

[PMP &ast;_ijuŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-4-48-POc-iucu-a)

The last four Pn reflexes restrict the sense to a part of reef exposed at low tide, but retain the sense of projection/prominence.

Reflexes of the next item, POc _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ with the gloss ‘cape’ are few and are not well distributed, but more careful inspection of the data reveals that these reflexes belong to the same cognate set as another word for ‘nose’. We give the reflexes in two sets: those with the gloss ‘cape’ or ‘headland’ first and then those for ‘nose’. Alone, the first set suggests a reconstruction _&ast;ŋora-ŋora_, but comparision with the terms glossed ‘nose’ reveals that final _-a_ is simply the reflex that occurs in certain Southeast Solomonic languages. POc _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ ‘nose, cape’ in its turn was originally probably a colloquial word for ‘nose’ derived from POc &ast;ŋorok ‘snore’.

[POc &ast;_ŋoro-ŋorok_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-4-48-POc-oroorok-a)


<a id="p-49"></a>

[POc &ast;_ŋoro-ŋorok_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-4-49-POc-oroorok-a)

The final reconstruction, PROc _&ast;mata_ ‘point of land, headland’ is evidently an extension of the more basic meanings attributed to POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)ata_, namely ‘point, blade, cutting-edge (of a weapon or instrument)’ ([vol.1,89](ContributionTable?anchor=p-89#cldf:1-4)).

[PROc &ast;_mata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-3-4-49-PROc-mata-a)


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. Inland topographical features



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Hill, mountain


Even quite small islands can be dominated by high peaks. While a number of peaks in New Britain and New Ireland reach 2000m, the much smaller islands of Manam and Karkar have peaks of 1800m, and Goodenough Island in the d’Entrecasteaux group has one of 2500m. Of the reconstructions below, POc _&ast;koro_[^4] and POc _&ast;solos_ have meanings centred on mountain or mountainous country. POc _&ast;puŋa-puŋa_ may have also denoted ‘mountain’ but its reflexes in Pn have come to refer to ‘upper surface’. Of the other reconstructions, _&ast;buku_ and _&ast;pwotu_ referred rather to a protuberance or a bulge-shaped object.


<a id="p-50"></a>

[POc &ast;_koro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-50-POc-koro-a)

[POc &ast;_solos_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-50-POc-solos-a)

<a id="p-51"></a>

[PMP &ast;_buku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-51-POc-buku-a)

Reflexes of _&ast;pʷotu_ refer consistently to ‘mountain’ only in MM languages, while some SES languages adopt the ‘knot, swelling’ meaning.

[POc &ast;_pʷotu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-51-POc-potu-a)

In Polynesia the typical term for mountain is a reflex of _&ast;maquŋa_.

[PPn &ast;_maquŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-51-PPn-maqua-a)


<a id="p-52"></a>

Note also the following PROc reconstruction:

[PROc &ast;_qulu ni panua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-52-PROc-qulunipanua-a)

A compound term for mountain ridge (‘back’ + ‘bone’) is reconstructable for PPn:

[PPn &ast;_tuqa-siwi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-1-52-PPn-tuqasiwi-a)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Valley


We have included two POc reconstructions glossed ‘valley’, although the second is reflected in only two languages.

[POc &ast;_mala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-2-52-POc-mala-a)

[POc &ast;_salil_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-2-52-POc-salil-a)


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Cliff


We have one POc reconstruction for ‘cliff’. Two further reconstructions are at PCP and PPn level. The two last may distinguish coastal and inland cliffs.


<a id="p-53"></a>

[POc &ast;_pʷaka(r,R)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-3-53-POc-pakarr-a)

[PPn &ast;_mato_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-3-53-PPn-mato-a)


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Cave


Although terms exist in many languages for cave, we have no evidence of cognacy outside Polynesia.

[PPn &ast;_qana_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-4-53-PPn-qana-a)


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Flat land



<a id="p-54"></a>

Almost every language for which we have extensive lexical data has a term meaning ‘flat land’, but cognates have been difficult to find. Our only reconstruction is based on cognates from Papuan Tip and Polynesia, with Polynesia using the same term in compound form for ‘lowland’. This is probably the same word as POc _&ast;raun_ ‘leaf’, which occurs in many languages as a kind of classifier for flat things.

[POc &ast;_rau(n)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-4-5-54-POc-raun-a)


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Land defined by vegetation


The following reconstructions include terms for particular kinds of land, identified primarily by vegetation. POc &ast;nuku ‘sandy ground’ may also be included here (see [§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:2-3) for cognate set)

### 5.1. Uncultivated land


The three following cognate sets are repeated from [vol.1,118](ContributionTable?anchor=p-118#cldf:1-5)–119.

[PAn &ast;_quCaN_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-1-54-POc-qutan-a)

The Mussau and Tolo reflexes mean ‘garden’: this change of meaning is probably due to the fact that, in Melanesia, gardens are often remote from the village and surrounded by bushland, so that to go to the garden is to go into the bush. POc &ast;qutan was also a local noun for the direction of the bush, namely ‘inland’ ([Ch.8, §2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:2-8)).


<a id="p-55"></a>

[PEOc &ast;_wao_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-1-55-PEOc-wao-a)

It is tempting to associate the set above with PMP _&ast;waRej_, POc _&ast;waRoc_ ‘vine, creeper, rope’, a reconstruction with many widespread reflexes. The implication here is that uncultivated rain forest was a place of tangled vines. However, Gela has two terms, _ao_ ‘forest’ (> _&ast;wao_) and _alo_ ‘creeper, string’ (> _&ast;waRoc_), indicating that there were two distinct terms at the time of POc or a little later, albeit with a possible common origin.

The next POc reconstruction contrasts with _&ast;quma_ ‘garden, cultivated land’ ([vol.1,117](ContributionTable?anchor=p-117#cldf:1-5))

[PMP &ast;_talun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-1-55-POc-talun-a)


<a id="p-56"></a>


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Swamp


A number of reconstructions are loosely glossed ‘swamp’. In wordlists these may be defined further as saltwater or freshwater swamps, or by their vegetation. Nipa palm and mangrove swamps are found in inter-tidal zones along the coast and in river estuaries, while lowland freshwater swamps, often dominated by sago, are found inland. However, few wordlists distinguish more than one kind of swamp, and we are unable to be more specific in our reconstructions.[^5] Two further reconstructions, POc _&ast;[dr,r]ano_ ‘lake, swamp’ and POc _&ast;[g,k]opu_ ‘pond, lagoon, swamp’ blur the distinction between water hole/lagoon and swamp.

[PAn &ast;_danaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-56-POc-drrano-a)

[PMP &ast;_paja_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-56-POc-paca-a)

The next term is reconstructable in two forms, as either _&ast;gopu_ or _&ast;kopu_. The MM terms and Lau reflect _&ast;k_, Motu and Arosi reflect _&ast;g_, while the remainder, from PT and SES, reflect either.


<a id="p-57"></a>

[POc &ast;_&#91;g,k&#93;opu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-57-POc-gkopu-a)

In the next two sets, emphasis is perhaps on the mud itself rather than on a muddy water feature.

[PMP &ast;_pitak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-57-POc-ppitak-a)

[POc &ast;_poŋa-poŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-57-POc-poapoa-a)

The final two reconstructed forms in this section probably referred to wet taro swamp gardens.

[PEOc &ast;_bʷela_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-5-2-57-PEOc-bela-a)

<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Inland water features



<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Fresh water


In POc a single word, _&ast;waiR_, evidently denoted both ‘fresh water’ and ‘river, stream’. A second term, _&ast;(dr,r)anum_, specifically denoted ‘fresh water’. Both forms continue PMP etyma reconstructed with the same meaning, and both are well represented across Oceanic subgroups.

[PMP &ast;_wahiR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-1-58-POc-wair-a)


<a id="p-59"></a>

The form _&ast;dranum_ below is reflected by most witnesses, but some languages (Motu, Nakanai, Namakir) reflect _&ast;ranum_, and the Admiralties languages may reflect either _&ast;dr_ or _&ast;r_.

[PAn &ast;_daNum_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-1-59-POc-drranum-a)


<a id="p-60"></a>

No POc term has been reconstructed for ‘river’ as distinct from the term for ‘fresh water’. Speakers of Oceanic languages would probably lack the map-based view of a river thought of primarily in terms of an entity with length. Rather, they seem to conceive of it simply as fresh water that flows. Tolai speakers refer to a river as _tava alir_, literally ‘fresh water flowing’, and Halia speakers use a semantically parallel compound, _ramun olo_. Dobu uses _ʔawa bwasi_, literally ‘channel of water’.

We have one lower-level reconstruction for a river branch.

[PEOc &ast;_maŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-1-60-PEOc-maa-a)


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Spring


For coastal dwellers, fresh water is often obtained from springs. PAn _&ast;Cebuj_ ‘spring’ is continued in POc by doublets, _&ast;topu(R)_ and _&ast;tupu(R)_. Oceanic reflexes refer mainly to springs on a beach or shoreline, or to brackish water. Doublets are found in some Southeast Solomonic languages.

[PAn &ast;_Cebuj_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-2-60-POc-topur-a)


<a id="p-61"></a>

Polynesian languages have a well-attested term for ‘spring’ which continues a PMP form meaning ‘source’. Curiously, no reflexes have been found in other Oceanic languages.

[PMP &ast;_punaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-2-61-POc-buna-a)

The next reconstruction, in its simple form _&ast;pura(q)_, was primarily a verb ‘bubble up’. Its reduplicated form may have served as a noun denoting a spring as it does in several Southeast Solomonic witnesses and in Bauan Fijian. Among several similar forms (see [Ch.4, §2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:2-4)), Blust (ACD) lists PMP _&ast;budaq_ ‘foam, bubbles, lather, scum, froth’, continued as POc _&ast;pura-puraq_ ‘foam, bubbles, bubble up’. The related forms include POc _&ast;puro_ ‘bubble up, (hot spring) boil’ (p.83).

[PMP &ast;_budaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-2-61-POc-puraq-a)


<a id="p-62"></a>

A number of languages use a compound, translatable literally as ‘eye of water’ or similar to refer to a spring. A POc reconstruction is possible given the existence of Indonesian _mata air_ ‘spring’, reflecting PMP _&ast;mata WahiR_ ‘spring of water’. Other compounds with similar meaning are found throughout the wider Oceanic region.

[PMP &ast;_mata WahiR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-2-62-POc-matawair-a)

Other compounds retaining reflexes of POc _&ast;mata_ ‘eye’ but varying in their term for ‘water’ include the following:

[2-3-6-2-62-nng-kaulong-ekimaran](cf.csv#cldf:2-3-6-2-62-nng-kaulong-ekimaran)


<a id="s-6-3"></a>

### 6.3. Waterfall


The following reconstruction, POc _&ast;sa[p,b]u(q)_, is used both as a verb ‘fall, trickle down, of water’ and a noun ‘waterfall’.

[PMP &ast;_sabuq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-3-62-POc-sapbuq-a)


<a id="p-63"></a>

POc _&ast;tape_ has been reconstructed in Chapter 4 as both a noun and verb meaning ‘flow’, with reference to ocean currents. However, it is also reconstructable, possibly reduplicated, with the meaning ‘waterfall’.

[POc &ast;_tape-tape_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-6-3-63-POc-tapetape-a)


<a id="s-7"></a>

## 7. Mineral substances (stone, obsidian, lime, pumice, sand, earth, salt)


The mineral substance most highly valued by POc speakers would have been hard, easily flakeable stone, ideally obsidian or flint, used to make razors, axes and knives. Obsidian was traded in the Bismarck Archipelago even in pre-Lapita times, but the range of the trade increased dramatically when Lapita settlements appeared in the late second millennium BC ([Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997), [Spriggs 1997a](Source#cldf:Spriggs1997a), [Summerhayes 2000a](Source#cldf:Summerhayes2000a)).


<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. Stone


The generic term for ‘stone’ or ‘rock’ was POc _&ast;patu_.

[PAn &ast;_batu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-1-63-POc-patu-a)


<a id="p-64"></a>

The form below is a reduplication of POc _&ast;maga_ ‘stone; slingshot’ ([vol.1,227](ContributionTable?anchor=p-227#cldf:1-8)). It probably referred to gravel or pebbles, as its reflexes do in Polynesian and Micronesian languages. Western Oceanic cognates show a semantic shift to ‘sand’.

[POc &ast;_maga-maga_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-1-64-POc-magamaga-a)


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. Flint, obsidian


Two reconstructions for obsidian were proposed in [vol.1(93](ContributionTable?anchor=p-93#cldf:1-4)), one at POc level and one at PWOc. They are:

[POc &ast;_na&#91;d,dr&#93;i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-2-64-POc-naddri-a)

[PWOc &ast;_qa&#91;r,R&#93;iŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-2-64-PWOc-qarri-a)


<a id="p-65"></a>


<a id="s-7-3"></a>

### 7.3. Coral, limestone


POc _&ast;laje_ was the general term for coral as the substance from which reefs are formed. It was also used to refer more specifically to living coral of the branching kind, in contrast with, for instance, POc _&ast;buŋa_ ‘smooth, round coral’. The cognate sets for _&ast;laje_ and _&ast;buŋa_ are included in [Chapter 4, §3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:2-4).

Dead coral was evidently valued as coral rubble (POc _&ast;giri-giri_), and as a source of the lime (POc _&ast;qapu(R)_), taken with betel nut.

[POc &ast;_giri-giri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-3-65-POc-girigiri-a)

The chewing of betel nut, combined with lime and pepper as a stimulant, is widespread in northwest Melanesia and the Solomons, but is not practised further east. Lime could be obtained by burning shells as well as coral.

[PAn &ast;_qapuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-3-65-POc-qapur-a)


<a id="p-66"></a>


<a id="s-7-4"></a>

### 7.4. Pumice


Pumice is a porous solidified lava that floats and is also useful as an abrasive. A compound term reflecting POc _&ast;patu_ + _maqañur_ (‘stone’ + ‘float’) is reconstructable for PEOc.

[PEOc &ast;_patu maqañur_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-4-66-PEOc-patumaqanur-a)

Other compound terms include Roviana (MM) _patu ale_ and Gela (SES) _vatu ali_, exhibiting reflexes of POc _&ast;qaliR_ ‘drift, float’ rather than POc _&ast;maqañur_ ‘floating, adrift’.

Proto Micronesian had its own term for pumice, probably preposed by _&ast;fatu_ ‘stone’.

[PMic &ast;_(fatu) wāni_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-4-66-PMic-fatuwani-a)

A distinctive term, PCP _&ast;vuqa(i)ŋa_, is reflected in Fijian and Polynesian. This term also referred to grindstones, reflecting the use of pumice as an abrasive.

[PCP &ast;_vuqa(i)ŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-4-66-PCP-vuqaia-a)


<a id="p-67"></a>


<a id="s-7-5"></a>

### 7.5. Sand


There is a well-attested POc term for ‘sand’ which continues a PAn etymon (see also POc _&ast;nuku_ ‘sandy ground’, p.45).

[PAn &ast;_qenay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-5-67-POc-qone-a)


<a id="p-68"></a>

A reduplicated form of the above can also be reconstructed. This may have denoted the property ‘sandy’ as well as ‘sand’.

[PMP &ast;_qenay qenay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-5-68-POc-qoneqone-a)


<a id="s-7-6"></a>

### 7.6. Earth, soil


Two POc terms meaning ‘soil’ are well-supported: _&ast;tanoq_ appears to have had three senses, (i) ‘earth, soil (as substance)’; (ii) ‘land, ground (as area or as opposed to sea)’ (this chapter, [§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:2-3) and [vol.1,119](ContributionTable?anchor=p-119#cldf:1-5)), and (iii) ‘down on the ground, down below (as location)’ ([Ch.8, §2.2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-5#cldf:2-8)). POc _&ast;pʷay(a)_ was probably limited to the first meaning.

Some soils contained pigments useful in both body and pot decoration. Although various wordlists include terms for red, white or yellow clay, we have not been able to reconstruct terms. Teeth-blackening was practised among Western Oceanic speakers (PWOc _&ast;tapal_ ‘substance used to blacken teeth’; [vol.1,101](ContributionTable?anchor=p-101#cldf:1-4)), but it is unclear from the literature whether the substance was mineral or vegetable matter .

[POc &ast;_pʷay(a)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-6-68-POc-paya-a)

In the cognate set above, final _-a_ is reflected only in PT languages, where it is often added after a POc final consonant. It is thus unclear whether _&ast;y_ was final in this POc item. The Titan final _-ñ_ and Sa’a final _-nā_ are also not understood.


<a id="p-69"></a>

There is also a POc form, _&ast;pʷiRa_, whose reflexes are, geographically, apparently in complementary distribution with the above set.

[POc &ast;_pʷwiRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-6-69-POc-pwira-a)

Central Pacific shows an innovation in replacing _&ast;tano(q)_ with _&ast;gʷele_.

[PCP &ast;_gʷele_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-6-69-PCP-gele-a)

Another cognate set may share ancestry with PCP _&ast;gʷele_. It includes Dami (NNG) _gele_ ‘swamp, soft ground’, certain Papuan Tip terms for ‘beach, sand’ (Wagawaga _gele-gele_ ‘sand’, Suau (Daui) _gele-gele_ ‘sand’, Nimoa _kele-kele_ ‘sand’, Keapara (Hula) _kele_ ‘beach’) and, less plausibly, Choiseul Island (MM) terms for a headland (Vaghua _kele-kele_, Varisi, Sisiqa, Babatana _ke-kele_). In this case PCP _&ast;gʷ-_ would be an irregular reflex (for expected _&ast;g-_) of POc _&ast;g-_.


<a id="s-7-7"></a>

### 7.7. Clay



<a id="p-70"></a>

Clay was used in pot manufacture, which was practised by POc speakers (see [vol.1,67](ContributionTable?anchor=p-67#cldf:1-4)–71). Although non-Oceanic cognates of POc _&ast;raRo(q)_ refer to ground or earth, e.g. Formosan Bunun _dalaq_ ‘ground (earth, land, place, soil)’; WMP Ilocano _daga_ ‘earth, land, soil’, and CMP Buru _rahe_ ‘ground’, we can infer that in POc, _&ast;raRo(q)_ referred specifically to ‘clay’. In NNG and Papuan Tip witnesses, reflexes refer to clay. Meso-Melanesian reflexes refer to clay cooking pots, but not, apparently, to the clay itself. New Caledonian reflexes refer to both clay and pots.

[PAn &ast;_daReq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-7-70-POc-raroq-a)


<a id="s-7-8"></a>

### 7.8. Salt


POc _&ast;maqasin_ seems to have been both a stative verb meaning ‘be salty’ ([vol.1,159](ContributionTable?anchor=p-159#cldf:1-6)) and a noun meaning ‘salt’. Its PMP antecedent _&ast;ma-qasin_, however, was purely a stative verb meaning ‘be salty’, derived from the noun _&ast;qasin_ ‘salty taste, salt’ (ACD). Like a number of other PMP stative verbs derived with _&ast;ma-_ from nouns, the prefix of _&ast;maqasin_ became fossilised in POc ([Evans & Ross 2001](Source#cldf:EvansandRoss2001)).

[PMP &ast;_ma-qasin_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-8-70-POc-maqasin-a)


<a id="p-71"></a>

PAn _&ast;qasiRa_ ‘salt’ has Oceanic reflexes. Despite the formal resemblance to PAn _&ast;qasiN_ / PMP _&ast;qasin_ ‘salt’, the supporting data in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) show clearly that these are distinct etyma. Blust (ACD) interprets the SES reflexes as reflexes of _&ast;tasik_ ‘sea’ (see [Ch.4, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:2-4)) with an added suffix _-la_, but it seems far more likely that they reflect POc _&ast;qasiRa_ ‘salt’.

[PAn &ast;_qasiRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-7-8-71-POc-qasira-a)


<a id="s-8"></a>

## 8. Fire


Oceanic languages generally have a sizeable vocabulary relating to fire. The present discussion is concerned chiefly with the chemistry of fire, i.e. with terms for the processes and products of burning. Cognate sets and reconstructed terms to do with human uses of fire were dealt with in volume 1 and most of these items will not be discussed here. The reconstructions presented in [vol.1(143](ContributionTable?anchor=p-143#cldf:1-6)–157, 293–295) include Poc _&ast;api_ ‘fire’, _&ast;rapu(R)_ ‘hearth, fireplace’, _&ast;suka_, _&ast;suka-i_ ‘make fire with fire-plough’, _&ast;tutu(ŋ)_, _&ast;tuŋi-_ ‘set fire to, light (a fire)’, _&ast;tunu_ ‘roast on embers or in fire’, _&ast;sunu_ ‘singe’, _&ast;nasu(q)_ ‘boil’, _&ast;pa[ka]-qasu_ ‘cure by smoking’, _&ast;tapa_ ‘dry food by heat to preserve it, smoke food’, _&ast;raraŋ_, _&ast;raŋ-i_ ‘heat s.t. or warm oneself by fire’, _&ast;sokot-i_ ‘burn grass, rubbish +’, _&ast;sulu_ ‘dry coconut leaf torch’, _&ast;qumun_ ‘oven made with hot stones’ and PEOc _&ast;papia_ ‘firewood’.

Oceanic languages, by and large, make similar lexical distinctions to everyday English when talking about chemistry of fire, but the matches are not exact. Many Oceanic primary terms (single morpheme lexemes) are polysemous or have a rather broad range of reference, e.g. in a given language the same term may denote both ‘ashes’ and ‘fireplace’, or ‘ash’ and ‘soot’, or ‘live coals’ and ‘embers’. English too, is vague or general in many of its primary terms, and relies on compounds and phrasal expressions to make finer distinctions, for example embers has a broad range of reference, as shown by such conventional descriptive expressions as live coals, glowing embers, dying embers, dull black embers, hot ash, white ash.

The kinds of lexical distinctions commonly made in Oceanic languages in this semantic domain can be exemplified by comparing Mota, of the Banks Is., Vanuatu ([Codrington and Palmer 1896](Source#cldf:CodringtonandPalmer1896)) and Kiriwina of the Trobriand Is., Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea (Lawton pers. comm.).

Mota has the general term _av_ ‘fire’ and at least nine terms for kinds of burning and emissions fom fire: _gao_ ‘burn (intr.)’, _gao-serlawalawa_ ‘burn with flame’, _pepe-roworowo_ ‘(of sparks, flames) fly up, flare, flash’, _malawo-av_ ‘fire flaming high’, _gara-mwea-av_ (N) ‘flame’, _lawa_ (V) ‘to blaze, flame’, _lolowo_ ‘to flare, flame’, _taŋaŋoi_ ‘(fire) almost gone out’, _asu_ (N) ‘smoke’, (V) ‘emit smoke, go up as smoke’. Mota also distinguishes the following stages in the reduction of wood by burning: _gar-taŋasul_ ‘firestick, burning log or stick’, _gao-searag_ ‘(of fuel) burn from middle to outside’, _gao-taweraga_ ‘burn down into embers’, _mata-were-av_ ‘live embers’, _tawene_ ‘a live coal, single live ember’, _taweris_ ‘dull black embers’, _gar-taweris_ ‘black embers, charcoal’, _taŋarnai_ ‘fine ashes’, _tuwus_ ‘the accumulation of ashes in a fireplace’, _tarowo_ ‘ashes, white ashes of burnt out wood’. It can be seen that about half of these 21 Mota terms are compounds. Some dictionaries of Oceanic languages are weak in coverage of compounds and for this reason their listings of fire terms are probably deficient.


<a id="p-72"></a>

In Kiriwina, in addition to the three general terms _kova_ (i) ‘fire’, (ii) ‘firestick’, _kaimova_ ‘(fire) be alive’, and _kaimata_ ‘(fire) be dead’, there are at least eight terms for burning and emissions from fire: _-gabu_ ‘burn (intr.)’, _lulu_ ‘blaze’, _mayela kova_ ‘tongues of fire’, _kata_ ‘burn without flame’, _kubowa_ ‘visible heat above a fire’, _visiga_ ‘glow from (unseen) fire’, _mseu_ (N) ‘smoke’, and _womi_ ‘(of smoke) drift, fill house’, and at least half a dozen terms for stages in the reduction of wood: _pwakova_ ‘hot coals’, _kovagwaia_ ‘smouldering ember or spark’, _pwanosi_ ‘cold ashes, residue of white ash and charcoal left after a fire’, _tubwaga_ ‘white ash from dead fire’, _kainunukwa_ ‘partially burnt stick’, and _vakatutu_ ‘burn up completely’.


<a id="s-8-1"></a>

### 8.1. Fire


The PAn name for fire, _&ast;Sapuy_, is among the more stable terms in the lexicon.

[PAn &ast;_Sapuy_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-1-72-POc-api-a)

In some Oceanic languages reflexes of POc _&ast;api_ are also used as a verb meaning ‘be on fire, burn’. However, this does not appear to have been the case in POc. There are stronger candidates for the verbal meaning (see [§8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-3#cldf:2-3) below).


<a id="s-8-2"></a>

### 8.2. Stages of reduction of wood by burning


Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;luten_ ‘firewood’ based on WMP: LongWat _luten_ ‘fire’, Kayan _luten_ ‘firebrand, partly burnt stick’, Bisaya Bukit _luton_ ‘burning brand’, CMP: Tetum _haʔi lutan_ ‘burning brand’, SHWNG: Sawai _luten_ ‘fire’, Oceanic: Mota _lito_ ‘firewood’. Blust (ACD) glosses the variants PMP _&ast;aluten_ and _&ast;aliten_ as (i) ‘firebrand’, (ii) ‘burning wood in a fire’, (iii) ‘charred wood’, but does not cite (iv) ‘firewood’. The Oceanic evidence offers support for senses (i) and (less strongly) (iv).

[PMP &ast;_luten_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-72-POc-aliton-a)


<a id="p-73"></a>

It appears that most Oceanic languages use a single term to refer to both ‘hot coals’ and ‘embers’. At any rate most dictionaries of Oceanic languages do not record such a distinction. POc _&ast;koran_ appears to have been used both as a noun denoting ‘fragments of burning wood’ and as a verb meaning something like ‘burn brightly’.

[POc &ast;_koran_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-73-POc-koran-a)

PMP _&ast;baRah_ ‘live coal’ may be reconstructed from, e.g. Tagalog _baga_, Malay _bara_, Ngadju-Dayak _barah_ ‘live coal’. This is possibly continued in Ramoaaina _para_ ‘bake on fire’, Motu _hara-ia_ ‘light a fire; broil’, _hara_ ‘platform of sticks on which meat is grilled’ but the meaning differences leave a question. There is already a distinct, well-established POc reconstruction for ‘cook over an open fire, roast over embers’, namely _&ast;tunu_ ([vol.1,293](ContributionTable?anchor=p-293#cldf:1-9)–294).


<a id="p-74"></a>

The following cognate set is tentatively attributed to a POc etymon glossed ‘low-burning remnants of a fire’. The Meso-Melanesian reflexes suggest ‘ash’ or ‘charcoal’. However, the meaning ‘ash’ can be eliminated because there are much stronger candidates for this. The partial agreement between Tolai, Wayan Fijian and Gela points to low-burning residue of some sort.

[POc &ast;_kapuru_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-74-POc-kapuru-a)

Charcoal is likely to have been distinctively named in Proto Oceanic. Carbonised wood was widely used in Pacific Island communities for drawing marks or, pounded and mixed with oil and water, for smearing on the skin. PMP _&ast;uRiŋ_ ‘charcoal, wood that is charred (but no longer burning fiercely)’ has been reconstructed by Dempwolff and others, based on e.g. Tagalog _uliŋ_, Bontok _uriŋ_, Ngadju-Dayak _b/uriŋ_, etc. but Oceanic cognates have not been noted. There is a well supported reconstruction for Remote Oceanic, _&ast;malala_, but this lacks clear cognates in Western Oceanic.

[PROc &ast;_malala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-74-PROc-malala-a)

POc used at least two terms to denote ashes. These had distinct but overlapping meanings. It appears that _&ast;rapu(R)_ referred specifically to ‘ashes of a fire’; the same term was also used for ‘hearth, fireplace’. A second term, _&ast;qapu_ or _&ast;kapu_, denoted ‘ash, dust, powder’ and its core meaning was probably ‘a mass of fine particles of matter’. The second term may also have been applied to volcanic ash and cinders. Several Oceanic languages reflect both _&ast;rapu(R)_ and a reduplicated form _&ast;rapu-rapu(R)_; but the dictionaries generally specify no difference in meaning between reflexes of the two.


<a id="p-75"></a>

[PMP &ast;_dapuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-75-POc-rapur-a)

Blust (ACD) attributes, to varying Austronesian interstages, a number of fairly similar forms whose gloss includes one or more of the following: ‘ash’, ‘dust’, ‘cinders’, ‘powder’. These forms include PAn _&ast;qabu_ ‘ash, cinders, powder’, PMP _&ast;abus_ ‘ashes’, _&ast;qabuk_ ‘dust’, and PWMP _&ast;abuR_, _&ast;apuk_, _&ast;qabug_ ‘dust’. PAn _&ast;qabu_, by far the most widely attested of these forms, is continued with regular reflexes in a number of Oceanic languages.

[PAn &ast;_qabu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-75-POc-qapu-a)


<a id="p-76"></a>

However, many Western Oceanic languages have forms that point to a form _&ast;kapu_ meaning ‘ash, dust’, with initial _&ast;k_ rather than _&ast;q_.

[PWOc &ast;_kapu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-2-76-PWOc-kapu-a)

It is noteworthy that in this set the NNG reflexes show initial _&ast;g-_, whilst PT and MM languages all show an unexpected fortis reflex of _&ast;k_ rather than the usual lenis reflex. One possible explanation for this is that, at some stage, perhaps in PWOc, reflexes of POc _&ast;qapu_ were contaminated by association with reflexes of POc _&ast;(g,k)abu_ ‘burn, firewood’ (see [§8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-3#cldf:2-3) below).

In some Oceanic languages reflexes of POc _&ast;qapu_ ‘ashes, dust’ fell together formally with reflexes of _&ast;qapu(R)_ ‘lime’ (see [§7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-3#cldf:2-3) above). Because lime is a powdery substance (made by roasting calcerous rock, such as coral or limestone, and used in some Oceanic societies for ritual and decorative purposes and for consumption with betel nut) this meaning may have been regarded as related to ‘dust’ and ‘ashes’.

### 8.3. Burning, being on fire


A number of terms for the general process of burning or being on fire can be reconstructed.

<a id="s-8-4"></a>

### 8.4. Emissions from burning materials: smoke, vapour, flames, light


POc, like some of its daughter languages, seems to have distinct terms for smoke as a thing (_&ast;qasu_) and the process of emitting smoke or vapour (_&ast;kupu(k)_).

[PMP &ast;_qasu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-78-POc-qasu-a)

In the following cognate set, Polynesian languages show unexpected _o_ for _&ast;u_ in the first syllable.

[POc &ast;_kupu(k)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-78-POc-kupuk-a)


<a id="p-79"></a>

PCP _&ast;kobulu_, possibly meaning ‘thick smoke or cloud’ is indicated by reflexes in Fijian and Maori. The existence of a probable cognate in Javanese _kəbul_ ‘smoke’ allows the tentative reconstruction of PMP _&ast;kəbul_, POc _&ast;kobul(u)_ ‘smoke’.

[PCP &ast;_kobulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-79-PCP-kobulu-a)

Widely scattered languages use a reflex of POc _&ast;maya_ ‘tongue’ (either alone, or in a compound meaning ‘tongue of fire’) to refer to flames. Given that ‘flame’ is a natural metaphorical extension of ‘tongue’ it is difficult to know whether _&ast;maya_ had this polysemy in POc or whether daughter languages have from time to time independently made the same extension.

[POc &ast;_maya (ni) (api)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-79-POc-mayaniapi-a)

[POc &ast;_puruŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-79-POc-puru-a)

Certain Papuan languages of the central and western Solomons show resemblant forms that are presumably borrowed from an Oceanic source.

|                                               |
|:----------------------------------------------|
| Papuan: Lavukaleve  huluhuluru        ‘flame’ |
| Papuan: Baniata     vuvuru            ‘flame’ |


<a id="p-80"></a>

There are several cognate sets pointing to PEOc or PROc forms denoting burning with a particular kind of light.

[PEOc &ast;_maka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-80-PEOc-maka-a)

[PROc &ast;_makalo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-80-PROc-makalo-a)

[PROc &ast;_kalo-kalo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-8-4-80-PROc-kalokalo-a)


<a id="p-81"></a>

Although contemporary languages generally have names for ‘soot’, ‘spark’ (V, N), and ‘burst into flame’ we have been unable to reconstruct POc terms for these concepts. In contemporary languages the term for ‘soot’ is sometimes a subsense of a term that also means ‘black’, or ‘dirty’ or ‘ash’ and sometimes a compound meaning ‘X of smoke’.

## 9. Destructive natural events


Because of their location on an unstable part of the earth’s crust, many parts of the Oceanic region experience earth movements and volcanic activity, sometimes on a catastrophic scale. Minor earth tremors are commonplace. Earth tremors in turn can give rise to such events as tidal waves and landslides, the latter sometimes triggered as well by frequent heavy rain. In addition to these, fluctuations in climate sometimes result in flooding or drought. In some Oceanic societies such destructive natural events were attributed to supernatural forces, as were inexplicable events like whirlwinds and whirlpools ([Osmond 2000](Source#cldf:Osmond2000)). [Map 9](#map-2-9) shows the location of earthquake areas and active volcanoes in the region.


<a id="s-9-1"></a>

### 9.1. Volcanic activity


Parts of New Guinea and Island Melanesia have a long history of volcanic activity. Within recorded history the area of New Britain round Rabaul, for instance, has been the scene of violent eruptions in 1850, 1878, 1937 and 1994, causing loss of life and enormous environmental damage. Although we have collected a range of terms for volcanoes and volcanic features, soundly based POc reconstructions for ‘volcano’ and features of volcanic activity such as lava and volcanic ash, have eluded us. It may well be that Melanesians had no separate concept for ‘volcano’, regarding it simply as a mountain that produces fire. In Manam, Takia and Nehan, the word for ‘fire’ is used also to refer to a volcano. Terms reconstructed in the section on fire above, such as POc _&ast;qapu_ ‘ash, dust, powder’ and POc _&ast;kupu(k)_ ‘emit smoke or steam’, could readily have been applied to volcanic features. A single lower-level reconstruction for ‘volcano’ comes from North Central Vanuatu, with a possible cognate from North New Guinea which suggests a rather tentative POc reconstruction.

<a id="p-83"></a>

The next reconstruction belongs to a set of formally similar items with meanings relating to bubbling, frothing and foaming (see _&ast;pura(q)_ on p.60). The semantic change evident between the Tolai and Mota glosses may perhaps be explained as transfer of meaning from ‘place/activity of emission’ to ‘matter emitted’.

[POc &ast;_puro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-1-83-POc-puro-a)

It is notable that in both cognate sets above, there is a tendency for the glosses to vary from one volcanic feature to another.


<a id="s-9-2"></a>

### 9.2. Earthquake


While the following two cognate sets are presumably related, we cannot unite them into a single set.

[POc &ast;_drike-drike_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-2-83-POc-drikedrike-a)

[POc &ast;_Rike_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-2-83-POc-rike-a)

In several of the following cognate sets, the term for earthquake is closely related to the verb meaning ‘to shake’. Some form of onomatopoeic wordplay may explain the similarity of form between the various sets. For instance, Onin and Sekar, CEMP languages spoken in West New Guinea, both record _nuni_ ‘earthquake’ while Yotafa on the north coast lists _nioni_ ‘earthquake’ ([Smits & Voorhoeve 1992](Source#cldf:SmitsandVoorhoeve1992):34).


<a id="p-84"></a>

[PMP &ast;_ninih_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-2-84-POc-ninir-a)

In a number of northwest and southeast Solomons languages, the term for earthquake is nunu. PMP _&ast;uyuŋ_ ‘shake; earthquake’ would give POc _&ast;iu(ŋ)_. The actor pivot PMP form _&ast;ŋ-uyuŋ_ would give POc _&ast;ŋ-iu(ŋ)_. This may be ancestral to the form _niu_ or _ñu_ ‘to shake, hence ‘an earthquake’, found in two MM languages, Hoava and Roviana, as well as to _nunu_ by regular depalatalisation.

<a id="p-85"></a>


<a id="s-9-3"></a>

### 9.3. Landslide


POc _&ast;solo_ was probably a verb, but its reflexes refer, inter alia, to landslides in several daughter languages. They are also found in Puluwatese (Mic), linked to star names, to refer to stars sinking towards the horizon (see [Ch. 6, §5.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4-2#cldf:2-6)).

[POc &ast;_solo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-3-85-POc-solo-a)

[PEOc &ast;_to(b,p)a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-3-85-PEOc-tobpa-a)


<a id="s-9-4"></a>

### 9.4. Tidal wave


No POc term denoting tidal wave has been reconstructed. In contemporary languages, terms for tidal wave are compounds, with the first element often a reflex of _&ast;tasik_ ‘sea’ ([Ch.4, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:2-4)) or _&ast;[u]Ruap_ ‘high tide’ ([§2.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-6#cldf:2-3)). These terms do not usually distinguish tsunamis, caused by undersea earth movements, from floods caused by a combination of high tide and strong wind. In any case, catastrophic tidal waves probably occur only once or twice a century, and affect only localised places. Although a number of terms for ‘tidal wave’ have been collected, and are listed below, cognates exist only within low level subgroups.

<a id="p-86"></a>


<a id="s-9-5"></a>

### 9.5. Flood, submerging tide


A PMP term for ‘flood’ (V and N) is continued in two known Oceanic witnesses. In Sa’a its reflex is a noun referring to a high spring tide. In Tongan it is a verb denoting the state or process of a river being in flood.

[PMP &ast;_bahaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-5-86-POc-paaq-a)

As a compound with the term for fresh water, POc _&ast;waiR pa(a)q_ ‘river floodwaters’, is traceable back to PMP, although the Tongan form is our only Oceanic reflex.

[PMP &ast;_wahir bahaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-5-86-POc-wairpaaq-a)

Flooding for coastal dwellers on small Oceanic islands is likely to be the result of an unusually high tide (POc _&ast;[u]Ruap_ ‘high tide; to flow in of tide’, see [Ch.4, §2.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-6#cldf:2-4)), rather than heavy rain. King tides or spring tides are phenomena which occur at regular intervals, so are unlikely to be of more than nuisance value except when exacerbated by high winds. Terms for tidal flooding may be compounds including reflexes of _&ast;[u]Ruap_, or a related form (_&ast;[ma-]uRua(p)_ ‘flood, be flooded’) (Sa’a _lua hā_ ‘high spring tide’, Mota _rue lava_ ‘large tide’, Bauan Fijian _ua luvu_ ‘submerging tide’). Other POc terms include reflexes of _&ast;lolo_ (V) ‘flood’, and _&ast;lomak_ (N,V) ‘flood, of sea’.

<a id="s-9-6"></a>

### 9.6. Storm, hurricane


Terms for destructive winds and storms are treated in Chapter 5. They include POc _&ast;paRiu_ ‘cyclone’ (from PAn _&ast;baRiuS_ ‘typhoon’), POc _&ast;mal(i,e)u_ ‘wind’ which gives rise to PMic _&ast;malu-malu_ ‘storm, typhoon’ and POc _&ast;apaRat_ ‘wet season when northwesterlies blow and sea is rough’ from which come PCP _&ast;avā_ ‘storm’, PPn _&ast;afā_ ‘storm, hurricane’.


<a id="s-9-7"></a>

### 9.7. Whirlpools, waterspouts, whirlwinds


Whirlpools and waterspouts and some other phenomena such as rainbows and echoes, are regarded in many Austronesian-speaking communities as supernatural occurrences, and are sometimes treated as a natural category, ‘taboo thing’ or similar. Accordingly we sometimes find ‘rainbow’ and ‘whirlwind’ within the same cognate set, or even, as in Mortlockese (Mic) _awúniyar_ ‘whirlwind, tornado, rainbow’, referred to by the same word.


<a id="p-88"></a>

The meanings of the prefix _&ast;qā-_, and the alternative form _&ast;pua-_ (blowing?) in the following set are uncertain.

[PROc &ast;_siosio_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-7-88-PROc-siosio-a)

The next item may be associated in some way with POc _&ast;piro_ ‘twist together’ ([vol.1,287](ContributionTable?anchor=p-287#cldf:1-9)).

[POc &ast;_piru-piru_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:2-3-9-7-88-POc-pirupiru-a)

## 10. Conclusion


Proto Oceanic terms are readily reconstructable for a number of landscape features, including land, island, beach, sandy ground, cape, bay, river, mountain, inland mountain country, valley, flat land, bushland, cultivated land, fallow land, lake, swampy ground, rock, and sand. Other reconstructable terms refer to fresh water sources and to the productive or unproductive nature of the land, both matters of crucial importance to human settlement. There are POc reconstructions for mineral substances, including obsidian and other stone, sand and gravel, coral and lime, pumice, earth, salt and clay. Although obsidian is found only in a few widely scattered locations, and clay suitable for potmaking is also limited in its range, both were sought-after items, and archaeological evidence indicates that POc speakers would have been familiar with either the raw material or its manufactured form through well-established trade networks.


<a id="p-89"></a>

But there are salient parts of Oceanic land environments for which we cannot reconstruct a POc term (and often no PWOc or PEOc term either). Reconstructions for features associated with volcanic action, such as hot springs and ash are tentative, based on apparent reflexes which vary quite widely in meaning. There are reconstructions for ‘earthquake’ and ‘flood’, but not for ‘tidal wave’. What does this tell us? Probably not that POc lacked these terms, but that they have been lost, or are not widely enough reflected for us to be able to identify them as POc. It may be that POc had compound terms for certain of these concepts, and it seems that compounds are less stable than simple lexemes.


## Notes

[^1]: Thanks are due to Ann Chowning, Ralph Lawton, John Lynch, Françoise Ozanne-Rivierre and Ian Scales who have all made useful suggestions and contributed additional data to this chapter.

[^2]: The form POc _&ast;tano(q)_ given in [vol.1,119](ContributionTable?anchor=p-119#cldf:1-5) has now been revised to _&ast;tanoq_. Evidence supporting final _&ast;-q_ lies in the retention of a final vowel in Kwamera (John Lynch, pers. comm.) and Iaai (Françoise Ozanne-Rivierre, pers. comm.) .

[^3]: In [vol.1,189](ContributionTable?anchor=p-189#cldf:1-7) the form POc _&ast;(i,u)cuŋ_ with gloss ‘projecting headboard of prow’ is reconstructed. This is almost certainly the same etymon as that reconstructed here.

[^4]: It is tempting to decide that this is the same term as POc _&ast;koro_ ‘(i) any fenced-in area’, (ii) settlement fortified by a palisade or ditch’ ([Pawley 2005](Source#cldf:Pawley2005)), on the basis that fortifications were typically situated on high ground. But there is strong evidence that there were two distinct terms at least as far back as POc.

[^5]: Languages where kinds of swamp are lexically distinguished include Kiriwina _dumia_ ‘inland swamp’, _pasa_, _vamova_ ‘mangrove swamp’ and Kwaio _kunu_, _kū-kunu_ ‘saltwater mud’, _kunu-kunu_ ‘freshwater mud, swamp’. Also Ulawa _lo-lolo_ ‘swamp in which sago palms grow’ and closely related language Sa’a which has _lo-loŋo_ ‘mangrove swamp’.

## 1. Introduction


Much of this chapter is reproduced from [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994)), reordered and slightly revised in the light of more stringent subgrouping assumptions.[^1] To that work have been added a number of terms related to fire and its accompaniments. Organization of the chapter is (1) fire and the fireplace; (2) cooking methods; (3) preservation and (4) food processing.

## 2. Fire and the fireplace


There is a well-attested term for fire that can be traced back to PAn:

[PAn &ast;_Sapuy_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-None-142-POc-api-a)

### 2.1. Fire plough


Fire was produced throughout the Oceanic world by friction. Often this was achieved by rubbing a piece of wood rapidly to and fro along a long groove or furrow cut into a second piece of wood. We have a term specifically for the action of lighting a fire with fire-plough. Note that the Central Pacific terms have unexplained vowel fronting.

<a id="fig-1-19"> </a>

[__Figure 19:__ POc _&ast;suka_, _&ast;suka-i_ 'make fire with fire-plough'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-19)



[POc &ast;_suka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-1-144-POc-suka-a)

A second term is POc _&ast;usu(q,p)_, from PMP _&ast;usuq_ whose primary meaning is probably 'rub abrasively', but which in a number of Oceanic languages is recorded as meaning 'rub to make fire'.

[PMP &ast;_usuq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-1-144-POc-usuqp-a)


<a id="p-145"></a>

Biggs (1993) has reconstructed PPn _&ast;kau-natu_, for the implement used. Although this compound is derived from POc elements (POc _&ast;kaiu_ 'tree, wood, stick' and POc _&ast;natu_ 'child'), we have no proof that the compound itself is POc. We can be confident, however, that the term is older than PPn, given that POc _&ast;kaiu_ was replaced by PPn _&ast;raqakau_ 'wood, tree', and POc _&ast;natu_ by PPn _&ast;tama_ 'child '.

A separate term for the upper frictioning stick can be reconstructed, but only for the Central Eastern subgroup of Polynesia:

[PCEPn &ast;_kau-lima_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-1-145-PCEPn-kaulima-a)

A Papuan Tip language, Minaveha, likewise uses a compound term for the upper frictioning stick which includes the term for 'hand', _nima-kabi_ (_nima_ 'hand' + _kabi_ '?'). In at least two places, Sissano (NNG) and Nakanai (MM), the upper fire stick is referred to by the term for penis (_etin_ in Sissano, _huti_ in Nakanai), both reflexes of POc _&ast;quti(n)_.

Across the Oceanic region it is possible to find some variation in fire-making methods, although we have no reconstructions for methods other than by fire-plough. Bing on the PNG north coast and Mapos Buang in the Huon Gulf area (both NNG) offer evidence for a method in which rattan or vine is sawn rapidly around a piece of wood:

[1-6-2-1-145-nng-maposbuang-vakrur](cf.csv#cldf:1-6-2-1-145-nng-maposbuang-vakrur)

Another north coast language, Gedaged, has a term, _wol_, referring to a bow string. Fire is produced by pulling a bow string rapidly back and forth over a piece of wood. The action implied may be the same as in Carolinian _bʷuru-bʷur_ 'make a fire by generating friction with a traditional drill' (from POc _&ast;buru_ 'bore a hole, drill' ; see [Ch. 9, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:1-9)).


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Firewood


In addition to the general term POc _&ast;kaiu_ 'wood, stick ', we can reconstruct a PEOc term _&ast;papia_, specifically for firewood. Note that an identical term is reconstructable for PEOc (cognates in SES and Fiji) with the meaning 'cook in native oven' ([§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:1-6)).

<a id="p-146"></a>


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Firebrand, torch


Blust has reconstructed a PMP term for wood alight but not yet consumed:

[PMP &ast;_aluten_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-3-146-POc-aliton-a)

<a id="fig-1-20"> </a>

[__Figure 20:__ POc _&ast;sulu_ 'dry coconut leaf torch'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-20)



A burning brand, typically made from coconut fronds, served as a torch.

[POc &ast;_sulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-3-146-POc-sulu-a)


<a id="s-2-4"></a>

### 2.4. Fireplace, hearth



<a id="p-147"></a>

Green and Pawley ([Ch. 3, §3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:1-3)) note a general term for fireplace or hearth, PMP _&ast;dapuR_, POc _&ast;rapu(R)_, with a frequent secondary meaning, particularly in Oceania, of 'ashes'. Compounding may be used to distinguish the fireplace as 'place of ashes'.

[PMP &ast;_dapuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-4-147-POc-rapur-a)

There is a second term, PAn _&ast;qabu_, POc _&ast;qapu_, with similar reference. Blust (ACD) comments: "_&ast;qabu_ is among the most widespread and stable morphemes in the Austronesian family. It referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashes in the fireplace (hence its recurrent replacement of PMP _&ast;dapuR_ in the meaning 'hearth')."

[PAn &ast;_qabu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-4-147-POc-qapu-a)


<a id="s-2-5"></a>

### 2.5. Trivet


We would expect to be able to reconstruct a term for a trivet, an arrangement of three stones on which the cooking pot is placed, but no clear reflex of PMP _&ast;dalikan_, 'trivet' ([Blust 1986](Source#cldf:Blust1986)) has been found, in spite of the presence of terms for trivet in north-west Melanesia and Fiji. For example:

[1-6-2-5-147-adm-mussau-atukotolu](cf.csv#cldf:1-6-2-5-147-adm-mussau-atukotolu)


<a id="p-148"></a>


<a id="s-2-6"></a>

### 2.6. Stone oven


A far more soundly based reconstruction is POc _&ast;qumun_ 'oven made with hot stones, cook in a stone or earth oven', which has reflexes in every major Oceanic subgroup, together with some external cognates.[^2] However, archaeological evidence points to such ovens having much greater antiquity in Near Oceania and Australia than in Southeast Asia ([Allen, Gosden & White 1989](Source#cldf:AllenGosdenWhite1989): 550-551; [Horton 1994](Source#cldf:Horton1994):380-381). The external cognates are therefore regarded as possible borrowings, and a higher-level reconstruction is not proposed.

[POc &ast;_qumun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-6-148-POc-qumun-a)

[Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 55) argues that the gloss 'earth oven' is too restrictive, as raised ovens (covered with leaves rather than earth) as well as pit ovens are common in Oceania.


<a id="s-2-7"></a>

### 2.7. Covering and uncovering an oven


The usual implement for handling hot stones and food in the oven was tongs, probably a bent or folded piece of cane or midrib of a coconut frond. Note that some terms have been derived from the transitive verb form POc _&ast;kapit-i-_ 'grasp (with tongs)'.

[PMP &ast;_qapit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-7-148-POc-kapit-a)


<a id="p-149"></a>

<a id="fig-1-21"> </a>

[__Figure 21:__ POc _&ast;kapit_ 'tongs' (from Nevermann_1933: 102)](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-21)



Lichtenberk adds a number of other terms which, as well as being used in relation to oven cooking, probably also have more general reference:

[POc &ast;_taqo(n)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-7-149-POc-taqon-a)


<a id="p-150"></a>

[PMP &ast;_bu(ŋ)kas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-7-150-POc-pukes-a)

[PMP &ast;_uruŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-2-7-150-POc-uru-a)

Only certain kinds of stones are suitable for use in stone ovens. Although some terms for these have been located, e.g. Sudest (PT) _ɣərumu_ 'cooking stones used for mumu', Sursurunga (MM, New Ireland) _kor_ 'kind of black stone used for mumuing', no cognates are identifiable.


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Cooking methods


Lichtenberk quotes from [Oliver](Source#cldf:Oliver1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Oliver1989):49) who has this to say about traditional cooking in Oceania: "Most cooking was by broiling, by boiling (where there were clay pots, which was not everywhere), and by baking (which was done in earth-pit ovens containing heated stones.)" Lichtenberk continues (p.270): "In some places, food is boiled not over fire but by means of hot stones dropped into a wooden bowl that contains the food and some liquid. Food can also be steamed. In baking and roasting, the food is often, though not necessarily, wrapped, usually in leaves, sometimes in bark."


<a id="p-151"></a>

He has listed terms for a range of cooking methods, with a word of warning as to the reliability of precision in English glosses ('roast', 'grill', 'broil', 'cook in fire' etc.). He writes (p.273), "Even though more than one term for roasting may be reconstructable for POc, the differences in the glosses for the witnesses most likely reflect differences in the English backgrounds of the authors rather than differences in cooking methods."


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Cooking in stone oven


[PEOc &ast;_papi-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-1-151-PEOc-papi-a)

Lichtenberk also gives a reconstruction, _&ast;biti_ 'cook with hot stones (either by baking in stone oven, or by boiling by dropping hot stones into liquid)' (p.271), which he suggests may be POc, although he points out that all cognates are from either Northwest or Southeast Solomonic languages, and thus likely candidates for borrowing. We have opted here to label his reconstruction PSS.


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Roasting, burning, branding


[PAn &ast;_CuNuh_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-2-151-POc-tunu-a)


<a id="p-152"></a>

[POc &ast;_mʷaRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-2-152-POc-mari-a)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Piercing, pricking


When food was roasted, instead of simply being placed in the fire, it may have been skewered. The terms referring to skewering and skewers were also used to refer to testing food by pricking to see whether it was done. (See PMP _&ast;cukcuk_, _suksuk_ 'skewer', and POc _&ast;(su)su(k)_ 'anything used to pierce, prick, a skewer'; _&ast;(su)suk-i-_ 'pierce, prick'; [Ch. 4, §3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:1-4) and [Ch. 9, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:1-9)).


<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Boiling, steaming


Two verbs are reconstructable for POc with the meaning 'boil'. The problem is that the sources of data do not usually distinguish between boiling and steaming, both of which are practised in Oceania, 'boil' being the usual gloss. The difference between boiling and steaming lies in the amount of liquid used. For boiling, the food is (more or less) entirely covered with the liquid; for steaming, only a small amount of liquid is used. If POc did have a lexical distinction between the two processes, there is some evidence, albeit weak, that the verb for 'boil' was _&ast;nasu_ and that the one for 'steam' was _&ast;napu_, It is also conceivable that of the two terms, _&ast;nasu_ was unmarked and could be used to refer to both types of process.

[PAn &ast;_nasuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-4-152-POc-nasuq-a)


<a id="p-153"></a>

[POc &ast;_napu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-4-153-POc-napu-a)

It is possible that the forms attributed to PPT _&ast;na(q)u(q)_ 'clay dish' in [Chapter 4, §2.1.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1-5#cldf:1-4), are also reflexes of _&ast;napu_: see the discussion there.


<a id="s-3-5"></a>

### 3.5. Warming


Lichtenberk contributes a POc term which he glosses as 'warm oneself by fire; warm up, reheat (esp. food)'. Ann Chowning has added cognates from Kove, Molima and Nakanai which, like the Pukapuka term, refer to heating of leaves in preparation for mat making (see [Chapter 4, §3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:1-4)).The POc gloss has been generalised accordingly.

[PAn &ast;_da(n)daŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-5-153-POc-rara-a)


<a id="p-154"></a>


<a id="s-3-6"></a>

### 3.6. Singeing


A term can be reconstructed for the action of singeing food in preparation for cooking:

[POc &ast;_sunu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-6-154-POc-sunu-a)


<a id="s-3-7"></a>

### 3.7. Wrapping prior to oven-cooking


Two similar terms for wrapping food for cooking (baking or roasting), POc _&ast;kapu(t)_, _&ast;kaput-i-_ and POc _&ast;kopu_, have been reconstructed. [Mills](Source#cldf:Mills1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Mills1981): 73) has proposed PMP _&ast;kaput_ 'close, cover', while [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Blust1986):45) gives a gloss of 'tie or clasp together' for an identical PMP reconstruction. Oceanic reflexes indicate two distinct terms, although there may have been some blending of meaning in daughter languages. Lichtenberk suggests that the two POc terms may have referred to different ways of wrapping food; [Firth](Source#cldf:Firth1957) ([1957](Source#cldf:Firth1957)), for instance, gives four terms for different ways of wrapping food in Tikopia. From the glosses below, it seems possible that _&ast;kapu(t)_, _&ast;kaput-i-_ referred to covering (as an earth oven is covered), whilst _&ast;kopu_ referred to the wrapping of the food in bundles. For both terms, reflexes indicate wider reference than to food alone. In Polynesia they have come to refer more specifically to clothing or blankets.

[PMP &ast;_kaput_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-7-154-POc-kaput-a)


<a id="p-155"></a>

[POc &ast;_kopu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-7-155-POc-kopu-a)


<a id="s-3-8"></a>

### 3.8. Uncooked food


Lichtenberk also considers terms for uncooked food. He proposes a general POc term _&ast;(a)mataq_ for raw food (possibly excluding certain foodstuffs) which also refers to unripe foodstuff, such as fruit. Its reflexes in fact seem to reflect two forms, _&ast;mataq_ and _&ast;qa-mataq_, the latter presumably derived from the former, but the function of _&ast;qa-_ is unclear.

[PAn &ast;_ma-qataq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-8-155-POc-mataq-a)


<a id="p-156"></a>

[PAn &ast;_qamataq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-8-156-POc-qamataq-a)

PAn/PMP _&ast;maqataq_ evidently consisted of _&ast;ma-_ 'anticausative' ([Ch. 2, §3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:1-2)) + _qataq_ 'eat something raw'. The POc reflex _&ast;mataq_ shows irregular loss of medial _&ast;-q-_. The unaffixed base also survived in POc, and is reflected, with meanings similar to _&ast;mataq_, in some Oceanic languages.

[PAn &ast;_qataq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-8-156-POc-qataq-a)

Alongside _&ast;qataq_, PAn also had a term _&ast;qetaq_, which retained its verbal use in POc, referring specifically to raw meat, fish and shellfish, and to the eating of such foods:

[PAn &ast;_qetaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-8-156-POc-kqoda-a)


<a id="p-157"></a>


<a id="s-3-9"></a>

### 3.9. Food cooked or ripe


Similarly, the term for 'cooked' also meant 'ripe'; both glosses could be subsumed as 'ready to be eaten'.

[PMP &ast;_(ma-)qesak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-9-157-POc-maosak-a)

Another term with meaning similar to _&ast;maosak_ stresses the good quality of the food:

[POc &ast;_&#91;ma&#93;noka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-3-9-157-POc-manoka-a)


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. Preserving


Lichtenberk (p.277) records two main ways of preserving food in Oceania. One is drying, either in the sun or above fire (the latter may involve smoking the food); the other is fermentation.


<a id="p-158"></a>


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Drying, smoking


[PAn &ast;_Capa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-4-1-158-POc-tapa-a)

In addition, Blust offers the following:

[PMP &ast;_pa&#91;ka&#93;-qasu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-4-1-158-POc-pakaqasu-a)

Malcolm Ross (pers.comm.) reconstructs:

[PNGOc &ast;_pa(r,R)a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-4-1-158-PNGOc-parra-a)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Fermentation


Fermentation of food is geographically much more restricted. Small islands, particularly atolls, are susceptible to food shortages as a result of drought or prolonged stormy weather which makes fishing impossible, and have greater need for food reserves. Food fermentation is practised primarily in those areas where sago is not available as a staple, the latter being easily stored for lengthy periods of time. Assuming that sago was available as a foodstuff in POc times (see [Dutton 1994](Source#cldf:Dutton1994)), Lichtenberk argues (p.278) that the nearly complementary distribution of sago as a staple and fermented foodstuff suggests that the presence of fermentation in Micronesia and Polynesia is due to independent developments. Also relevant, however, is the fact that fermented breadfruit is regarded as one of the few foods suitable for carrying on longer sea voyages, and thus a prime suspect, along with its term, for borrowing. [Yen](Source#cldf:Yen1975) ([1975](Source#cldf:Yen1975)) writes that in Melanesia fermentation appears to be practised only in Santa Cruz and ascribes its presence there to Polynesian influence. However, David Walsh has pointed out (pers.comm. with Lichtenberk) that fermentation is practised also in some areas in Vanuatu. (See the Namakir form _mada_ below.) Ross (Food plants, vol. 3) points out that there is a curious cross-over between the reflexes of PEOc _&ast;mara_ 'preserved breadfruit' and POc _&ast;madraR_ 'grow ripe, overripe', _&ast;madraR-i-_ 'grow ripe, overripe from (s.t.) (?)'. In scattered languages in Vanuatu, Fiji and Micronesia, a reflex of _&ast;madraR_/_&ast;madraR-i-_ has taken over the 'preserved breadfruit' sense which we would instead expect to find associated with a reflex _&ast;mara_. Since closely related languages both in Vanuatu and in Micronesia disagree as to which term they reflect, Ross infers that the closeness of both form and meaning has led to confusion between the two terms, leading to more than one independent occurrence of crossover. POc _&ast;madraR_ seems to have been applied specifically to breadfruit and bananas, both of which become soft and mushy when overripe. Breadfruit and bananas are also the two foodstuffs which today are most commonly preserved by fermentation ([Yen 1975](Source#cldf:Yen1975)). Chowning lists a Nakanai cognate which indicates that the original POc term may have meant simply 'be spoiled (of food or drink)', with its meaning narrowing in Eastern Oceanic.


<a id="p-159"></a>

[POc &ast;_mara_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-4-2-159-POc-mara-a)

[POc &ast;_madraR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-4-2-159-POc-madrar-a)

Other terms which in parts of Polynesia refer to fermented breadfruit are derived from POc _&ast;maqasin_.

## 5. Food processing



<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Pounding


We have terms for the action of pounding or crushing, but have been unable to reconstruct any term for the implement or implements involved apart from PWOc _&ast;walu_ 'sago beater' and POc _&ast;ike_ '(bark-cloth) beater' (for the latter, see Ch. 4, §S . l).

[PWOc &ast;_walu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-1-160-PWOc-walu-a)

Sago is pounded with an implement consisting of a head like a small adze, mounted on a long handle (Ann Chowning pers.comm.). Smaller wooden pestles are used for mashing foodstuffs like taro, banana and breadfruit, and for crushing nuts, particularly galip (_Canarium_) and betel (Areca) nuts. Sometimes stones are used, or wooden pestles with stone heads. Lithgow lists Muyuw (PT) _kilakil_ 'stone-headed sago pounder', and Chowning (pers.comm.) records a Nakanai (MM) term _mulumu_ 'pestle of wood or bone used for crushing almonds or areca nuts', from the verb _mumu_ 'crush in a mortar'. Lichtenberk write (p.277) that:

> Pounded foods are widespread in Oceania ([Yen 1975](Source#cldf:Yen1975)). In Pidgin and in English they are referred to as 'puddings' (although not all puddings require pounding). The usual main ingredient is tubers (taro, yam), cooked and pounded, mashed into a paste together with other ingredients such as coconut cream or nuts, and then usually recooked.

A large wooden bowl (POc _&ast;tabiRa_, PCP _&ast;kumete_, see [Ch. 4, §2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:1-4)) was traditionally used as a mortar. Sago was pounded in a trough, stronger and heavier than a bowl, and designed so that water could run off from one end. Only isolated terms have been located (Muyuw _kas_ 'trough for sago-making'; Loniu _kupʷi_ 'trough in which sago is pounded').

<a id="fig-1-22"> </a>

As Blust (ACD) notes, terms dealing with the action of pounding frequently contain the root _&ast;-tuk_. A number of reconstructions have been made which evidently refer to hitting, pounding, beating, breaking open, and so on, not just of foodstuffs, but with general application. Cognate sets for the following reconstructions are included in [Chapter 9, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:1-9): POc _&ast;tutuk_ 'pound, mash by pounding, hammer, crack by hammering' (from PAn _&ast;tuqtuq_); POc _&ast;tuki-_ 'pound'; POc _&ast;putu(k)_ 'knock, pound, beat' (ACD) (from PMP _&ast;buTuk_); and POc _&ast;qatuŋ-i_ 'strike from above, pound'.


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Grating, scraping


Foodstuffs such as tubers and coconut meat are often grated before further processing. Tubers also need to be scraped to remove dirt. Both processes can be carried out with a shell such as a cockle, and the scraper/grater may be referred to by its shell name. Scrapers and graters are not always separately identified. The same implement may serve both functions, just as the same verb may refer to both actions.

A number of formally similar terms have been reconstructed for the action of scratching, scraping and grating. Although the reference is often primarily to preparation of foodstuffs, such terms are often used to refer to any similar action such as scratching the skin or scraping the bottom of a canoe.

[POc &ast;_rasi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-2-165-POc-rasi-a)

Yet another reconstruction is POc _&ast;asa(q)_ 'grate, sharpen by grating or rubbing' from PAn _&ast;Sasaq_ 'whet, sharpen' (see [Ch. 4, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:1-4).S).

Lichtenberk comments (pp. 280-281) on the recurring sound symbolism evident in these items, a feature which Blust has identified with PAn forms meaning 'rub, scrape, scratch'. Terms with similar sound symbolism readily undergo conflation. Lichtenberk also refers to the possibility that in POc or pre-POc times there was some kind of derivational relation among at least some of the forms, noting that unlike the other forms, _&ast;ko(r,R)as_ took as its direct object a noun phrase referring to the stuff scraped off rather than the object being scraped (e.g. the coconut meat rather than the coconut). (See also [Ch. 9, §2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:1-9).)

### 5.3. Peeling


Lichtenberk lists a number of terms for the action of peeling. The first is a transitive verb formed from the base _&ast;kulit_ 'skin'. See also POc _&ast;supi_ 'sharpen, shave, pare' ([Ch. 9, §3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:1-9)) some of whose reflexes also mean 'peel'.

### 5.5. Husking


The following term may have referred both to the husking of coconuts and to the implement used. This was a sharpened stick, usually set finnly in the ground. The same term is sometimes used to refer to a digging stick.

[POc &ast;_kojom-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-5-167-POc-kojom-a)

POc _&ast;soka_, _soka-i-_ (V) 'pierce; stab' (see [Ch. 9, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:1-9)) (Lichtenberk has _&ast;joka_) and POc _&ast;potak_ 'crack or split open (nuts, coconuts) are also used of husking coconuts:

### 5.6. Straining


The most common method of straining, necessary for processing such foodstuffs as sago and coconut cream, and also used in the production of kava, is by using the fibrous spathe of a coconut frond.

[PMP &ast;_Runut_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-6-168-POc-runut-a)

[Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994)) reconstructed PEOc _&ast;unu(p)_ 'strainer, probably the fibrous spathe of a coconut frond', but it is reasonably certain that the reflexes attributed thereto should be combined with those above and attributed to _&ast;Runut_/_&ast;nuRut_ ([Ross 1996d](Source#cldf:Ross1996d)). Lichtenberk reconstructed final _&ast;-p_ on the basis of Mota (NCV) _unuv_ '(a fluid) sink in, be absorbed', but we take this not to be cognate. As [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990)) points out, Sa'a (SES) shows irregular loss of initial _&ast;R-_, but Rennellese (pn) _gunu_, borrowed from a SES language, reflects Proto SES _&ast;lunu_ (< POc _&ast;Runut_). Sa'a also shows loss of _&ast;R_ in a few other items, so its loss here is not completely surprising.

### 5.8. Wringing, squeezing


Lichtenberk includes several terms for squeezing or wringing:

[PAn &ast;_peRes_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-8-169-POc-poros-a)

[PMP &ast;_pitpit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-8-169-POc-ppippit-a)


<a id="p-170"></a>

[PMP &ast;_pespes_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-8-170-POc-posi-a)

[PMP &ast;_le(c,s)it_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-8-170-POc-losit-a)

Another reconstruction, POc _&ast;piri_ 'twist, wrap around', whose reflexes refer typically to the manufacture of rope or twine (see [Ch. 4, §3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:1-4)), has reflexes in some languages which refer to extracting coconut milk by squeezing it through coconut fibre (MM: Kia _piriki_ 'wring, squeeze coconut milk', NCV: Tamambo _viri_ 'twist, plait, braid; coconut milk'. See also SES: Arosi _biri-yi_ 'squeeze coconut milk through fibre').

Lichtenberk writes (p.283):

> It is not possible to detennine fully what the distinctions were among the various terms for extracting liquid, but a number of contrasts can be postulated. Items _&ast;pipik_, _&ast;pisak_, _&ast;poji_, _&ast;losi_ took as their direct object a noun phrase referring to the object out of which liquid is extracted, whereas _&ast;poRos_ and _&ast;pirik_ took as their direct object a noun phrase referring to the liquid extracted. _&ast;pipik_ and _&ast;pisak_ referred to squeezing by pressing, while _&ast;poji_ and _&ast;losi_ referred to squeezing by wringing. The item _&ast;pirik_ referred specifically to a wringing action, while _&ast;poRos_ may have been an unmarked term whose meaning subsumed both pressing and wringing. (As Ann Chowning has pointed out [pers.comm.] there are two basic ways used to extract coconut cream: wringing coconut gratings through coconut 'cloth', or squeezing them in one's hands.)

### 5.9. Mixing


Finally, Lichtenberk lists terms for mixing or stirring:

[POc &ast;_mo(n,ñ)o_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-9-171-POc-monno-a)

[POc &ast;_(n,ñ)(a,o)tu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-9-171-POc-nnaotu-a)

[PMP &ast;_palu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-9-171-POc-balur-a)

Blust records another:

[PMP &ast;_quli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-6-5-9-171-POc-quli-a)


## Notes

Some data and comments have been added from Malcolm Ross's verb analysis in Chapter 9.

[^2]: WMP: Chamorro _chum_ 'hole in the ground for baking'; CMP: Fordata _umun_ 'pit in which tubers are baked'; Kei _umun_ 'pit in which food is cooked'.

[^4]: [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990):65) also cites PCP _&ast;ŋiwai_ on the basis of an Eastern Fijian term 'browned by exposure to sun',

[^5]:   See [Chapter 9, §2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:1-9)and accompanying footnote 2. Ross proposes PAn root _&ast;-ras_ 'grate, scrape, scar', POc _&ast;kora(s)_, _&ast;koras-i-_ 'scrape out (coconut meat +); dregs of strained coconut scrapings'.

## 1. Introduction


The artefacts considered here are mainly household items, used in the gathering and storage of food, in the construction and maintenance of dwellings and gardens, and those used for personal adornment. Some of the items—earthenware pots, stone adzes and axes, bone needles, bone and shell ornaments, and stone bark-cloth beaters—have provided archaeologists with data that permit dating. Those made of perishable materials—such as leaf baskets, string bags, mats and bamboo knives—seldom leave any trace in the archaeological record. For these we are dependent on linguistic reconstruction interpreted in the light of current ethnographic practice.[^1]

Artefacts are organised under the following headings: (1) containers; (2) mats and cordage; (3) tools; (4) items of body decoration and clothing, and (5) instruments of communication and music. Terms for relevant processes are included. Thus, within the section on mats and cordage we have included terms for weaving, making thread, sewing, and for needle and twine. Often the term for a tool is derived from the verb denoting the activity of using it.

## 2. Containers

### 2.1. Pottery containers


Pottery is one of the more distinctive features of the Lapita culture, here held to coincide with and thus be an integral marker of the early dispersal of Proto Oceanic.[^2] Pottery manufacture in Oceania is geographically discontinuous. By no means all Oceanic speakers make pottery. Obviously, pottery can only be made where suitable clay is available, but its availability is no guarantee that pottery will be manufactured. Nor is its absence from the immediate locality a guarantee that pottery will not be made: the Gumawana speakers of the Amphlett group transport their clay some distance by sea from Fergusson Island. As a result of this discontinuity, pots were traditionally important trade items. A linguistic spin-off of this trade is that words for pots are not infrequently loan words, especially in the languages of the people who are not potters.


<a id="p-68"></a>

[Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996c) ([1996c](Source#cldf:Ross1996c):69) writes that most Oceanic languages have quite a simple pot terminology with three or four main terms.

> There is generally a term for cooking pot, which often also doubles as the term for pottery in general … Secondly, there is a term for water pot or water jar. Thirdly, there is a term for a bowl or dish with a variety of functions, and finally a term for a frying dish or frying pan (in some societies the object itself is actually the large sherd of a broken pot).

There is fair agreement across Oceanic languages about the structure of the terminology—Ross provides evidence from NNG, PT, Admiralties and Fijian languages which all have terms (not necessarily cognate) for pot (generic), cooking pot, water jar, bowl/dish and frying pan (see [Figure 4](#fig-1-4))—and we have PMP reconstructions in support of corresponding POc terms. However, our cognate sets are disappointingly small. Of our reconstructions, the cooking pot/generic term is the most soundly based.

#### 2.1.1. Cooking pot


[PMP &ast;_kuDen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-68-POc-kuron-a)


<a id="p-69"></a>


<a id="s-2-1-2"></a>

#### 2.1.2. Water jar


The best candidate for 'water jar' is POc _&ast;kalala(ŋ)_, reconstructed on the basis of Proto WMP _&ast;kalalaŋ_ 'narrow-necked water jar' (Tagalog _kalalaŋ_ 'narrow-necked water jug'; [Blust 1980b](Source#cldf:Blust1980b)). However, only one Oceanic reflex, in the PT language Iduna, has been found: _kalala_ 'cooking pot made in Wedau'. Even this reflex is problematic, since POc _&ast;l_ is reflected as Iduna _n_ in directly inherited items, and we must therefore assume that the item has been borrowed, as its gloss would imply.

Another possible, PNGOc, term for water jar is _&ast;bʷad(r)i_, for which the evidence is given below. All reflexes except one are from the north coast of New Guinea, and mean 'pot (generic), cooking pot', where they have ousted reflexes of POc _&ast;kuron_ in this role, but there is evidence that this is the result of post-Proto Oceanic genericisation. The characteristic Oceanic cooking pot and water jar are quite similar in form, differing only in the narrowness of the neck of the water jar, so that genericisation of the water jar term is quite likely. The facts that the one non-north coast term, from Misima, means 'water pot' and that there are indications (in Mindiri and Bilibil) that reflexes of _&ast;bʷad(r)i_ also mean 'water pot' suggest that this was its original meaning.

[PNGOc &ast;_bʷad(r)i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-69-PNGOc-badri-a)

The Motu and Lala items are either borrowed or simply bear a chance resemblance to this set.


<a id="p-70"></a>


<a id="s-2-1-3"></a>

#### 2.1.3. Frying pan


The best candidate for 'frying pan', POc _&ast;palaŋa_, has been noted by Blust (ACD). Again, Oceanic reflexes are not plentiful, but here there can hardly be any doubt that they reflect the PMP term.

[PMP &ast;_balaŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-70-POc-palaa-a)


<a id="s-2-1-4"></a>

#### 2.1.4. Large cooking pot


One other Proto Oceanic term for a type of pot is reconstructable, namely _&ast;bʷaŋa_. This seems to have referred to a large pot, perhaps a communal cooking pot:

[PMP &ast;_báŋaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-70-POc-baa-a)


<a id="s-2-1-5"></a>

#### 2.1.5. Dish


We have been unable to reconstruct a POc term for a bowl or dish. Indeed, the only term we have found reflected over quite a large area is PPT _&ast;na(q)u(q)_. The meanings of its reflexes indicate that it meant 'dish'. In a number of PT languages it has come to mean 'cooking pot', but this is not surprising if it is recognised that in south-east (but not central) Papua, the typical Oceanic cooking pot with its restricted spherical form has been frequently replaced by pots with an unrestricted, dish-like form. In Gumawana, an important pot-making centre in the Amphletts, _no_, reflecting _&ast;na(q)u(q)_, has been genericised to mean 'pot' and is the first element in a number of pot types listed in Olsen's dictionary: _nobadala_, _nogaiga_, _nokaokao_, _nokunu_, _nopaeva_, _nosipoma_. All of these are apparently dish-like in form. Some reflexes of _&ast;naquq_ are listed below. The crucial reflexes for determining the meaning of _&ast;na(q)u(q)_ are those from central Papua-Hula, Motu and Kuni—where Oceanic restricted pot forms remain the norm, and _naɣu_/_nau_ clearly refers only to dishes.

[PPT &ast;_na(q)u(q)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-70-PPT-naquq-a)

Only the Hula form reflects a possible medial _&ast;-q-_. Since Hula sometimes adds a nonetymological _-y-_ between vowels, _&ast;-q-_ cannot be reconstructed with certainty. Final _&ast;-q_ is reflected in Iduna and Sudest, but not in Gumawana, Molima or Are, where a reflex would also be expected. These uncertainties raise the possibility that this term is cognate with the forms attributed to POc _&ast;napu_ 'steam (?), boil (7)' ([Ch. 6, §3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:1-6)).


<a id="p-71"></a>


<a id="s-2-1-6"></a>

#### 2.1.6. Lid


Both cooking pots and narrow-necked water jars may have utilised lids. In addition to those terms glossed 'plug, stopper', which are included with coconut or bamboo water carriers, we have terms referring rather to 'lid' or 'cover':

[PMP &ast;_tub-tub_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-71-POc-tutup-a)

[PMP &ast;_tub-an_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-1-71-POc-tupan-a)

Note that _&ast;tup-a((n,ŋ))_ is a nominalised form derived from _&ast;[tu]tup_, _&ast;tupi_ (see discussion of nominalisations in [Chapter 2, §3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:1-2)).


<a id="s-2-1-7"></a>

#### 2.1.7. Tools in pot manufacture


Oceanic pots were typically made using the paddle-and-anvil technique, whereby a smooth stone (the 'anvil') is held against the inside of the pot while the outside is beaten with a flat piece of wood (the 'paddle'). Almost every Oceanic pot-making group for which we have data refers to the anvil simply as the 'stone', for which the POc word was _&ast;patu_ (Andra _pat_, Mindiri _pot_, Uruava _patu_, Bauan Fijian _vatu_ are all reflexes used both in the general sense of 'stone' and in the specialised sense of 'anvil'). [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996c) ([1996c](Source#cldf:Ross1996c)) has reconstructed _&ast;tapi_ 'paddle for beating clay into shape' with the proviso that the apparent reflexes may be independently derived instrumental nominalisations of the PMP verb _&ast;tapik_ 'slap, pat lightly' ([Blust 1988](Source#cldf:Blust1988)).


<a id="p-72"></a>


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Wooden or coconut-shell containers



<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. Wooden bowl


The most important non-ceramic vessel in immediate pre-contact times was the wooden bowl. In parts of Papua New Guinea, finely-wrought bowls were an important trade item. (Among the most famous are bowls from the Tami Islands off the Huon Peninsula and the Trobriand Islands). The generic term for a wooden bowl was probably POc _&ast;tabiRa_:

[POc &ast;_tabiRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-72-POc-tabira-a)

<a id="fig-1-5"> </a>

[__Figure 5:__ POc _&ast;tabiRa_ 'wooden bowl'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-5)



This last set could be taken to reflect a POc _&ast;&ast;tabili_, but their formal and semantic similarity to reflexes of _&ast;tabiRa_ suggests that this inference is not justified. Rather, they are probably descended from an etymon which originated somewhere in the Solomons in the borrowing of a reflex of _&ast;tabiRa_ denoting a trade item, apparently a wooden dish used for mashing and/or crushing.


<a id="p-73"></a>

A term with more restricted distribution and apparently denoting a subtype of _&ast;tabiRa_ is PNGOc _&ast;gabom_ 'wooden dish':

[PNGOc &ast;_gabom_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-73-PNGOc-gabom-a)

PSS _&ast;popo_ 'wooden bowl' is reconstructable (Gela _popo_ 'a bowl', 'Are'are _hoho_ 'a wooden bowl for pounding food', Lau _fofo_ 'a round wooden dish') but no cognates are known outside the Southeast Solomons.

[PCP &ast;_kumete_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-73-PCP-kumete-a)


<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. Cup, liquid container


One of the most widely-used containers was the coconut-shell cup, for which we have several reconstructions. The term for a gourd also refers to a water bottle in some languages.

[POc &ast;_(b,bʷ)ilo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-73-POc-bbilo-a)

[POc &ast;_lasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-73-POc-lasa-a)


<a id="p-74"></a>

[PEMP &ast;_ubi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-74-POc-ubi-a)

<a id="fig-1-6"> </a>

[__Figure 6:__ POc _&ast;(b,bʷ)ilo_ 'coconut shell used as liquid container', POc _&ast;lasa_, POc _&ast;ubi_/_&ast;ibu_ 'coconut half shell-cup' __Figure 7__: POc _&ast;kulopi_ 'cup, ladle' (from Nevermann_1934: 179)](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-6)



[PMP &ast;_ka(ŋ)bu(q)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-74-POc-kabu-a)


<a id="p-75"></a>

The gloss proposed for the following reconstruction is highly tentative:

[POc &ast;_kulopi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-75-POc-kulopi-a)

An additional reconstruction, POc _&ast;asu_ (V) 'scoop or ladle out' ; (N) 'ladle, bailer', from PMP _&ast;aŋsu_ 'scoop or bail out' is included in [Chapter 7, §7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4#cldf:1-7).

The following set, from [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996a) ([1996a](Source#cldf:Ross1996a)), is listed because explanation is needed for the fact that it is apparently reflected only in Yapese and NNG languages: is it a retention or a borrowing? (Takia _-ae-_, Bilibil, Megiar _-ai-_ reflect _&ast;-a-_ which has undergone umlaut because of a lost final _&ast;-i_.)

[POc &ast;_d(r)ag(i)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-75-POc-dragi-a)


<a id="s-2-2-3"></a>

#### 2.2.3. Water bottle


Water may be carried and stored in bamboo or coconut-shell bottles stoppered with leaves. Blust has reconstructed a term for a coconut-shell bottle:

[PSHWNG &ast;_waip_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-75-PSHWNG-waip-a)

but adds a warning note that the Oceanic forms cited may reflect POc _&ast;waiR_ 'fresh water'. If so, all that can be inferred is a second gloss for this reconstructed form (ACD).

[PROc &ast;_tapaya_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-75-PROc-tapaya-a)


<a id="p-76"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-4"></a>

#### 2.2.4. Stopper


A number of terms are reconstructable for the plug, probably of rolled leaves, used to stop up the mouth of a water bottle:

[POc &ast;_joŋ-a(n,ŋ)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-76-POc-joan-a)

This is a nominalisation of the verb below (cf. [Ch. 2, §3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:1-2)):

[PAn &ast;_seŋseŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-76-POc-jojo-a)

Two other etyma are reconstructable in the domain 'lid, cover, stopper', but it is impossible to determine their exact meanings:

[POc &ast;_buruŋ(a)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-76-POc-burua-a)

[PEOc &ast;_bʷalu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-76-PEOc-balu-a)


<a id="s-2-2-5"></a>

#### 2.2.5. Lime pot


There is one other kind of container associated with Melanesians other than the inhabitants of Vanuatu and Fiji, and that is the lime pot of betel-nut users. The lime container is usually a gourd, coconut shell or small tightly-woven basket. A lime spatula of bone or wood, sometimes highly decorated, rests in the gourd and is used to convey lime to the mouth. We have a reconstruction for the spatula, POc _&ast;d(r)amu_, but no specific term for the lime pot. In a number of word lists the term for lime (often from POc _&ast;qapu(R)_) also can refer to the pot. We have reconstructed a PROc term for a gourd, _&ast;tapaya_ 'gourd, water bottle', but there are no cognates from SES, which is the only area of eastern Oceanic where betel is chewed, and we lack any Western Oceanic reconstruction.


<a id="p-77"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-6"></a>

#### 2.2.6. Lime spatula


[POc &ast;_d(r)amut_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-2-77-POc-dramut-a)

The final _-i_ of Mussau _ra-ramuti_ suggests that this reflects a transitive verb _&ast;d(r)amut-i-_, perhaps 'add lime to a chew of betel nut'.

<a id="fig-1-8"> </a>

[__Figure 8:__ POc _&ast;d(r)amut_ 'lime spatula'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-8)




<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Woven containers


Usable baskets or trays can be improvised in a few minutes from the wealth of leaves and fibres generally within easy reach. Baskets used today vary greatly in size, shape and function. They range from the large trays used at feasts to tiny purses carried within string bags. Individual communities have evolved their own shapes, styles and traditions of use. Some styles may be so individual or striking that they come to be representative of a particular region or community. Baskets may be with or without handles; carried over the shoulder, from the head or hand or under the arm; used by men only or women only; strictly utilitarian or finely decorated, multi-purpose or highly specific in their use. Different styles may be distinguished by name.

Perhaps surprisingly, in view of the widespread use of bags and baskets and the large number of terms collected, it has proved difficult to locate clear cognate sets with broad distribution. Any proliferation of types and styles would require new terms or reinterpretation of old terms. The likelihood of borrowing is also high.

[PMP &ast;_ka(n)tuŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-3-77-POc-katum-a)

Arosi _-s-_ from _&ast;-t-_ is conditioned by a following _&ast;-u_, supporting its reconstruction rather than that of _&ast;-o_. Carolinian _xɔ̄t_ and some other Micronesian cognates are problematic, since their _-t_ reflects POc _&ast;s_ or _&ast;j_ rather than _&ast;t_.


<a id="p-78"></a>

[POc &ast;_laka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-3-78-POc-laka-a)

[POc &ast;_ta(b,bʷ)e_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-3-78-POc-tabbe-a)

[PWOc &ast;_kase_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-3-78-PWOc-kase-a)

[PROc &ast;_kete_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-2-3-78-PROc-kete-a)

This form is unlikely to be of POc ancestry, as medial _&ast;-e-_ is rare in POc. It may well have an association with one of the two _&ast;k_-initial forms above.


<a id="p-79"></a>

<a id="fig-1-9"> </a>

[__Figure 9:__ Reconstructions (non-specific) include: POc _&ast;katu(m,ŋ)_ 'basket', POc _&ast;laka_ 'basket ', POc _&ast;tab(w)e_ 'basket, probably small', POc _&ast;taŋa_ 'basket or bag, small, used for personal effects' (after Koch_1986: 104 and n.d.:59)](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-9)



Biggs (1993) lists two further terms for PPn, _&ast;taapola_ 'basket plaited from a single coconut frond' (from POc _&ast;bola_ 'coconut leaves woven together for any purpose'. See under [§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:1-4) Mats); and _&ast;qora_ 'fishing basket'.

Bags, typically of twine made from fibres rolled together on the thigh and then knotted into a mesh, are more likely to be used for carrying than for storage. They are a prominent item among western Oceanic peoples, the women carrying them slung from a band round the head, and the men generally over one shoulder. On the New Guinea mainland, they are the means by which a woman carries a baby. The widespread modern term for these bags is _bilum_, a Tok Pis in term apparently from Tolai, but without cognates outside MM. The present distribution pattern of use would seem to reflect a possible Papuan origin for the net bag. In east New Britain (Tolai and Baining at least) heavy loads are carried in a coconut leaf basket suspended from the forehead by a tumpline (Ann Chowning, pers.comm.). The following reconstruction may have been a general term for a small plaited or woven container which has come to refer to a net bag in parts of western Oceania.

## 3. Mats and cordage



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Mats


Woven mats are made from the leaves of a range of palms, and frequently the same term is used for both tree and the article typically made from it. Thus we have POc _&ast;kiRe_ 'coastal pandanus: mat made from its leaves', and PWOc _&ast;moke_ 'pandanus species, used to make capes and mats' (see Plants, vol. 3). Mats on which food is placed will usually be made from coconut leaf. Where strength and endurance are important, as in canoe sails, pandanus is the preferred leaf, and the items are sewn rather than woven. Sleeping mats and house walls may be of either leaf. On the use of reflexes of &ast;qebal for sails, see [Chapter 7, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:1-7).

[POc &ast;_qebal_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-1-80-POc-qebal-a)

<a id="p-81"></a>

[PROc &ast;_bola_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-1-81-PROc-bola-a)

It is possible that the two NCV reflexes in the above set are borrowings from Polynesia (Ross Clark pers.comm.). If so, this reduces the reconstruction from PROc to PCP.

[PEOc &ast;_ibe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-1-81-PEOc-ibe-a)

Two further terms have been reconstructed for PPn only: _&ast;fala_ 'plaited pandanus mat', and _&ast;fāliki_ 'cover floor with mats or grass; floor covering', both from Biggs (1993).


<a id="s-3-1-1"></a>

#### 3.1.1. Weaving, plaiting


The distinction between weaving and plaiting is not clear even in English, although as a broad principle, weaving produces a fabric and plaiting a braid. Sometimes plaiting is used in descriptive accounts as a general term for all forms of mat and basket making. There are some processes in mat making where the edges of the mat are finished with a kind of braiding. Any distinction between the terms in word lists is consequently not considered significant, unless clarified by context. Where plaiting is used in reconstructions here, it is to be taken as an inclusive term for all kinds of mat and basket manufacture (but excluding loom weaving).

Biggs (1993) adds one lower-level reconstruction: PPn _&ast;laŋa_ 'plait (mat, basket) .


<a id="p-83"></a>

Ann Chowning (pers.comm.) has offered an additional sense to POc _&ast;raraŋ_, _&ast;raraŋ-i-_ (from PAn _&ast;da(n)daŋ_), which Lichtenberk glosses as 'warm oneself by fire'; 'warm up, reheat (esp. food)' (see [Chapter 6, §3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5#cldf:1-6), for the full cognate set). She contributes cognates from Molima, Kove and Nakanai which all refer to the preparation of pandanus leaves for mat making by softening them over a fire, and accord closely with the gloss of the single Polynesian cognate.

[POc &ast;_raraŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-1-83-POc-rara-a)


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Cord, twine


The simplest material for tying would have been lengths of vine or rattan, or strips of suitable bark, such as hibiscus. (POc _&ast;waRoc_ 'vine, creeper, rope, string'; POc _&ast;quwe_ 'rattan' (see Plants, vol. 3)). A strong light twine could be made by rolling fibres together on the thigh. The strongest cords and ropes are made by twisting or plaiting various kinds of fibres or rolled thread, principally coconut fibre or hibiscus bark.

[POc &ast;_loqi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-2-83-POc-loqi-a)

An unrelated PPn term has been reconstructed for the same process, _&ast;amo_ 'prepare fibres for string making (by rubbing between hands or on thigh); prepared fibre' ([Biggs & Clark 1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)).

The product of tying a piece of cordage is, of course, a knot. POc seems to have had no term dedicated to a knot as understood in English, but had the more generalised term &ast;buku, which referred to a node, protuberance, joint or knot (this word was also used with the meaning 'tie a knot'; see [Chapter 9, § 10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10#cldf:1-9)):

<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Sewing


POc _&ast;saqi(t)_ was the term used specifically for sewing activities. The terms _&ast;(su)suk-i_ 'pierce, sew (mats)' and _&ast;(su)suRi_ 'bone (needle); sew' were also used for sewing, but this was not their primary meaning.

<a id="p-87"></a>

In the following set there may be some blending of meaning between two formally close terms, POc _&ast;s(u,i)ri_ 'pierce, poke' ([Ch. 9, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:1-9)) and POc _&ast;suRi_ 'bone', because needles were at times made from bones (of bird or flying fox or occasionally pig).

[POc &ast;_(su)suRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-3-2-87-POc-susuri-a)

The following term for needle, POc _&ast;saRum_, evidently had specific reference to a tattooing needle, in addition to a more general meaning.

### 4.1. Cutting implements



<a id="s-4-1-1"></a>

#### 4.1.1. Axe, adze


[Oliver](Source#cldf:Oliver1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Oliver1989):88) identifies axe heads as having cutting ends bevelled on both sides, adzes as having cutting ends bevelled on one side only, and axe-adzes which are bevelled so as to be used either way. They are, of course, hafted differently on to their handle, the axe head lying along the same plane while the adze head is set at right angles to the handle. Axes would have been used primarily in tree-felling; adzes for such activities as the hollowing out and shaping of canoes, or the extraction of pith from sago palms. Either implement could have been utilised in the shaping of timber for the construction of houses, fenceposts etc. Although the preferred material for an adze blade was presumably basalt, archaeological sites in Island Oceania contain numbers of axes and particularly adzes, made of shell, mostly of _Tridacna_, the giant clam ([Oliver 1989](Source#cldf:Oliver1989): 89). On coral atolls, shell often has by necessity to substitute for stone.

Note the change in meaning in the three examples given at the end of the following cognate set. All three languages are Samoic Outliers.

[POc &ast;_(m,mʷ)ata-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-89-POc-mmata-a)

The following are possibly related to the set above but all reflect an extra _&ast;i_ (Loniu and Tawala reflect a possible POc _&ast;mʷati_, the NNG items a putative _&ast;(m,mʷ)aita_). It is possible that this _&ast;i_ reflects the incorporation into _&ast;(m,mʷ)ata_ of the generic possessive preposition _&ast;qi_, which would frequently have occurred immediately after it (e.g. POc _&ast;&ast;(m,mʷ)ata-qi kiRam_ 'axe blade') and is reflected in Mota matai above.

The existence of axe and adze heads with characteristic shaping to accommodate a handle, together with reconstruction of a term clearly designating 'handle of adze or axe' indicates that POc speakers were familiar with a stone head hafted to a wooden handle. This would have been by means of gum adhesives and cordage, much as described by latter day ethnographers (e.g. [Oliver 1974](Source#cldf:Oliver1974): 135-137 for Tahiti).

[PMP &ast;_paRada_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-90-POc-pparara-a)

With regard to the reconstruction of _&ast;(p,pʷ)_, see [Chapter 2, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:1-2). Western Oceanic and SES languages show assimilation of POc _&ast;r_ to _&ast;R_, but we assume that assimilation had not occurred in POc, since, as Blust points out, Puluwat _r_ reflects POc _&ast;r_, whilst Woleaian _ṣ_ inexplicably reflects POc _&ast;dr_. One of the Arosi reflexes and the Raga, Puluwat and Woleaian reflexes show haplology.

#### 4.1.2. Knives


Knives were typically made from bamboo. Shells also provided good cutting edges. Probably the very best cutting edge would have been a flake of obsidian, used as a razor or for whatever forms of surgery might have been performed on the human body, and the term for this was apparently _&ast;koto_ (see below). However, dedicated terms for 'knife', as opposed to the substances they were made from, are hardly reconstructable in POc. The only one we can be sure of is:

[PMP &ast;_pisaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-91-POc-piso-a)

Although PCP _&ast;sele_ 'knife; cut with a knife' seems to have cognates elsewhere, it is highly likely that the Lukep, Lihir and Nengone terms were introduced by Fijian or Polynesian missionaries to apply to western metal knives:

[PEOc &ast;_sele_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-91-PEOc-sele-a)


<a id="p-92"></a>

Although the following Admiralties set bears a superficial similarity to the CP set above, the forms are too different to suggest cognation. PEAd _&ast;care_ points back to an otherwise unattested POc _&ast;&ast;ja(r,c)e_.

[PEAd &ast;_care_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-92-PEAd-care-a)

Biggs (1993) includes one further reconstruction for 'bamboo knife', PPn _&ast;kofe_.


<a id="s-4-1-3"></a>

#### 4.1.3. Flint, obsidian


Obsidian, glass-hard volcanic stone found on Lou Island (Admiralties), on Fergusson Island in the D'Entrecasteaux group, at Talasea (Willaumez Peninsula of New Britain) and Banks Island, Vanuatu, and, from its traces in excavated Lapita sites, a much sought-after trade item among early Oceanic speakers, serves as a fine cutting edge. POc _&ast;nad(r)i_ is reconstructable, although in places it refers only to hard stone (with a cutting edge?). _&ast;qa(r,R)iŋ_ is reconstructable only for PWOc. Reflexes of POc &ast;koto refer to a variety of uses of the material and suggest that its primary meaning was 'obsidian cutting edge':

<a id="fig-1-11"> </a>

[__Figure 11:__ POc _&ast;nad(r)i_ 'flint, obsidian, stone with a cutting edge'; POc _&ast;koto_ 'obsidian knife or blade'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-11)

[POc &ast;_koto_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-93-POc-koto-a)

A group of eastern Polynesian languages have a term for obsidian probably derived from POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)ata_ 'cutting edge' ([§4.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-1#cldf:1-4)).

<a id="s-4-1-4"></a>

#### 4.1.4. Awl


Multi-purpose piercing tools may have been carried, fashioned from bone, perhaps a pig's femur. These were useful for piercing shells, splitting fibres for weaving, splitting areca nuts, separating coconut meat from its shell and such daily activities. They were probably also used to pierce earlobes and the nasal septum. [Green](Source#cldf:Green1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Green1979):39) lists a worked pig-tusk piercing tool from the Main Reef Islands, circa 1100 B.C. Reconstructions appear primarily verbal, with a term for the instrument sometimes derivable from the verb. They include  POc _&ast;puru(k)_, _&ast;puruk-i-_ 'pierce, bore (hole)', POc _&ast;buru_ 'bore a hole, drill'; PWOc _&ast;bʷaR(i,e)_ 'bore (hole)'; and PEOc _&ast;paRo_ 'drill through, pierce, perforate' (see [Chapter 9, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:1-9), for the cognate sets).


<a id="p-94"></a>


<a id="s-4-1-5"></a>

#### 4.1.5. Sharpening and grinding


There is evidence that all three of the basic methods for shaping stone—flaking (also called chipping), pecking and grinding—were practised in POc times ([Oliver 1989](Source#cldf:Oliver1989): 144). We have several reconstructions for actions which include sharpening or grinding, but they may also refer to grating (foodstuffs), and at times to rasping and filing (wood and shell). Pumice, widely available in volcanic regions, was typically used for sharpening stone. Although we can reconstruct terms for the activity, the only reconstruction we have for the implement is the PCP term for a whetstone.

[PCP &ast;_vuqa(i)ŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-94-PCP-vuqaia-a)

From its form it is clear that PCP _&ast;vuqa(i)ŋa_ is a nominalisation. The corresponding verb occurs in Polynesian languages with somewhat altered meaning (Samoan _foa_ 'break rock or shell', Hawaiian _hoa_ 'strike with stick or club'). Together with the WOc cognates, Iduna (PT) _fua-_ 'crush', Motu (PT) _huari_ 'smash, as pottery' and Tolai _puar_ 'break (cup, glass +)' they point to POc _&ast;pu(q)a(R)_, _&ast;pu(q)aR-i-_ 'break, as s.t. hard, smash'.

[PAn &ast;_Sasaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-94-POc-asaq-a)


<a id="p-95"></a>

[PMP &ast;_kirkir_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-95-POc-kiri-a)

[POc &ast;_giri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-4-1-95-POc-giri-a)

Both _&ast;kiri_ and _&ast;giri_ are reconstructable, the latter perhaps a verb from _&ast;N-kiri_; the Polynesian reflexes are attributable to either.

The same terms may have also been used to describe the actions of smoothing and polishing. The Polynesians, in particular, were concerned to produce a fine finish to their artefacts by rubbing. Beaglehole wrote of the Tahitians, "All their [wood] work however acquires a certain neatness in the finishing for they polish every thing, even the side of a canoe or a Post of a house, with Coral sand rubbed on in the outer husk of a Cocoa nut and rays skin, which makes them very smooth and neat." (quoted in [Oliver 1974](Source#cldf:Oliver1974): 134). The general term for this may have been POc _&ast;quju(r)_ 'rub, make smooth by rubbing' (see [Ch. 9, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:1-9)). In at least one language (Woleaian in Micronesia) the term for a file is the same term as that for stingray (_faiya_ > PAn _&ast;paRis_ 'stingray'), the skin of which serves as a fine abrasive.

## 5. Bark-cloth, clothing, body decoration



<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Bark-cloth (_tapa_)


The material used to make bark-cloth or tapa in the Pacific area is obtained mainly from various species of trees belonging to the genera _Broussonetia_, _Artocarpus_, and _Ficus_, all of which belong to the family Moraceae. Wherever _tapa_ was made, the _Broussonetia papyrifera_ or paper mulberry tree was used for the highest quality cloth. It is not native to the Pacific, but to eastern Asia, whence migrants carried it to Indonesia and the Pacific. The only other significant source is the _Pipturus_ species, used for _tapa_ particularly in Hawaii ([Kooijman 1972](Source#cldf:Kooijman1972): 1).


<a id="p-96"></a>

Bark-cloth is a significant item in Indonesia and in the eastern Oceanic region, particularly Polynesia, but also Santa Cruz, New Caledonia and Fiji. However, it does not feature strongly in the western Oceanic region. [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1918) ([1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918): 186) wrote that although bark-cloth (_tapa_) was made in Melanesia, it never figured as an article of clothing, and its main use was to form a kind of shawl in which the baby was slung when carried from the shoulder. Ivens was probably speaking from a Solomons perspective. [Kooijman](Source#cldf:Kooijman1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Kooijman1972):446) quotes reports by Chalmers and Gill (1885) which mention bark-cloth from Collingwood Bay and the Gulf of Papua (both PT); while in the Northern Province of south-east Papua, for instance, bark-cloth is a prestigious valuable. In parts of New Britain it was used to bind the heads of young babies to achieve the desired elongated skull shape (Ann Chowning, pers.comm.). Kooijman (pp.446-453) points out that the descriptions of the manufacture of New Guinea bark-cloth and the study of the museum material indicate that, as a rule, this _tapa_ is relatively thick and stiff and made from _Ficus_ and Artocarpus varieties, rather than from Broussonetia. He believes that the latter was probably not used for _tapa_ cloth in New Guinea. He records little mention of bark-cloth use in Micronesia, other than the wearing of _tapa_ ponchos in Ponape. [Yen](Source#cldf:Yen1973) ([1973](Source#cldf:Yen1973):83), in his examination of the origins of Oceanic agriculture, describes the cultivation of paper mulberry, as a pruned shrub for the production of bark for cloth, as ceasing west of the Melanesia/Polynesia border area.

<a id="fig-1-12"> </a>

[__Figure 12:__ POc _&ast;ike_ 'tapa beater'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-12)



Although terms can be located in WOc, none are cognate, and no POc term is reconstructable, apart from terms for the sources of raw material, POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)ase_ 'wild mulberry, paper mulberry, '_Broussonetia papyrifera_' POc _&ast;kuluR_ 'breadfruit, _Artocarpus_' (from PAn _&ast;kuluR_) and POc _&ast;nunu(k)_ (from PMP _&ast;nunuk_ 'banyan, _Ficus_ spp.') (see Plants, vol. 3).

The term _tapa_, now virtually the generic term for bark-cloth, can be reconstructed for PCP.

[PCP &ast;_taba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-1-96-PCP-taba-a)

Note that although the general term for bark-cloth in Tonga is _ŋatu_ and in Samoa is _siapo_, the term _tapa_ does exist in both places. In Tonga today it refers more generally to 'edge, rim, border, boundary', and in Samoa it refers to the uncoloured border of the coloured bark-cloth sheet or _siapo_. Biggs (1993) lists these as apparently unrelated homonyms. Alternatively, if we assume the original PPn meaning of _&ast;tapa_ to be 'bark-cloth which was not printed or stained', its more restricted meaning in Samoa is understandable.


<a id="p-97"></a>

A second term in Polynesia, referring both to plant and product, is widespread:

[PPn &ast;_siapo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-1-97-PPn-siapo-a)

A number of reconstructions have been made at PCP or PPn level, but the similarity of gloss indicates the likelihood of more subtleties of meaning than we have been able to identify here. They include: PCP _&ast;ŋatu_ 'old or worn bark-cloth', PCP _&ast;leu-leu_ '(old) tapa cloth', and PPn _&ast;ŋafi-ŋafi_ 'old mat or bark-cloth' ([Biggs & Clark 1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)).

The only term reconstructable for the Southeast Solomons is apparently limited to the island of Malaita.

[1-4-5-1-97-ses-lau-maku](cf.csv#cldf:1-4-5-1-97-ses-lau-maku)

We have a reconstruction for the mallet used in beating _tapa_ which goes back as far as PMP:

[PMP &ast;_ike_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-1-97-POc-ike-a)


<a id="p-98"></a>

Biggs (1993) has PPn reconstructions for the action of beating _tapa_ (_&ast;tutu_), and the board or anvil on which this was done (_&ast;tutua_). Both terms are derived from PAn _&ast;tuqtuq_ 'hammer, pound, crush ', POc _&ast;tutuk_ (see [Ch. 9, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:1-9)). It is of interest that the Toradja of central Sulawesi also have a term _totua_ for the wooden board on which the bark-cloth is beaten ([Kennedy 1934](Source#cldf:Kennedy1934)).


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Clothing


Over the region as a whole there is enormous variation in the degree and nature of body covering in these areas. [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 46) points out that "although ornaments were worn everywhere, clothes were not; for example, in parts of the Bismarck Archipelago both sexes wore nothing. In others, as Nakanai and part of Kove, only women wore clothing." Where clothing was worn, bark-cloth was undoubtedly the most substantial wearable material. Leaves, and to a lesser extent, grass, were used to fashion skirts, aprons and G-strings.


<a id="s-5-2-1"></a>

#### 5.2.1. Loincloth


The following reconstruction of POc _&ast;malo_ is soundly based, although there is doubt as to whether the term can be traced back to an earlier stage. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Blust1970): 133) proposes PMP _&ast;maru_ 'loincloth', but notes the difficulty of reconciling the PMP form with the POc, with the latter having unexplained _&ast;o_ for expected _&ast;u_ and _&ast;l_ for expected _&ast;r_. There can be little doubt that the POc term referred to bark-cloth and a garment made from that material.

[POc &ast;_malo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-2-98-POc-malo-a)


<a id="p-99"></a>

Another apparent POc reconstruction for a loincloth, _&ast;sulu_, with cognates in Kilivila (PT) and New Ireland as well as in the central Pacific, is relegated to PCP or PPn on the grounds that the term and garment were brought to New Guinea by Fijian and Polynesian missionaries in the nineteenth century.

The term _&ast;tipi_ 'man's loincloth' perhaps had the generic sense 'man's clothing', as its reflexes have been reinterpreted quite broadly with changes in sartorial customs.

[POc &ast;_tipi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-2-99-POc-tipi-a)


<a id="s-5-2-2"></a>

#### 5.2.2. Grass or leaf skirt


Perhaps surprisingly, there is no widely reflected item for 'grass-skirt' or, more accurately, 'leaf skirt'. The set below has cognates in two primary subgroups, but, since the Admiralties and the north coast of New Guinea were connected by trading links, it may be due to borrowing.

[POc &ast;_nai(V)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-2-99-POc-naiv-a)

Along much of that coast, reflexes of POc _&ast;jiRi_ 'cordyline' are used for 'grass-skirt':

[POc &ast;_jiRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-2-99-POc-jiri-a)


<a id="p-100"></a>

Biggs (1993) has reconstructed PPn _&ast;titi_ 'skirt or kilt worn in the dance', a term which may have the same source.

A term found only on the island of New Guinea is:

[PNGOc &ast;_ram(i,e)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-2-100-PNGOc-ramie-a)

POc _&ast;kaput_ and POc _&ast;kopu_ have been mentioned in relation to the wrapping of food before oven cooking (see [Ch. 6, §3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7#cldf:1-6)), although both are believed to have more general reference (_&ast;kaput_ 'wrap up, cover', _&ast;kopu_ 'bundle up together'). It would seem that in Polynesia their reflexes have also come to apply to the covering of the body, PPn _&ast;kafu_ 'spread over, cover the body (with a blanket)' PPn _&ast;kofu_ 'wrap up; clothing'.


<a id="s-5-3"></a>

### 5.3. Paint, smear, anoint


The practice of rubbing oil or grease on the body is known throughout the region, coconut and candlenut oil being favoured, rather than the pig fat used in the Highlands. The practice of painting red, yellow, black or white designs on the face and body with clay, lime etc. is found mainly in Melanesia. POc _&ast;lumu(k)_ most probably refers to oil. POc _&ast;pani_ would seem to cover both oiling and painting. Reflexes of POc _&ast;lumut_ 'seaweed' and _&ast;lumu(k)_ 'oil' coincide in several SES languages, so the 'Are'are term appears to be a blend of the two meanings, the idea of anointing with oil presumably introduced with Christianity.

[PMP &ast;_lumuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-3-100-POc-lumuk-a)

In Fiji and Polynesia, reflexes of a different term, PCP _&ast;sinu_ 'oil' are used.


<a id="p-101"></a>

[POc &ast;_pani_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-3-101-POc-pani-a)

Chowning (p.48) mentions another form of body ornamentation, the blackening of teeth, evidently widespread in Melanesia as far east as the Solomons. [Seligman](Source#cldf:Seligman1910) ([1910](Source#cldf:Seligman1910):492) describes the custom among the people of Tubetube (PT), in which fragments of a black bituminous semi-fossilised wood called _tari_ are mixed into a paste with the chopped and roasted leaves of the badira tree, and held against the teeth overnight. He gives the purpose of teeth blackening as 'a means of personal adornment and to attract the opposite sex'. A reconstructed form, _&ast;tapal_, can be made for PWOc (the Sa'a term, _taha_ rather than the expected _aha_, has to be considered a borrowing). [Mikloucho-Maclay](Source#cldf:MiklouchoMaclay1975) ([1975](Source#cldf:MiklouchoMaclay1975):89) recorded in 1871 that "The natives [of Astrolabe Bay] not only blacken their faces, but also the mouth (tongue, teeth, gums, lips) with a substance which they chew." He gives the name _taval_ for this substance. Although we cannot attribute _taval_ to a particular language (Mikloucho-Maclay lived in a village of Papuan speakers), it is evidence that reflexes of _&ast;tapal_ occur in the NNG area.

[PWOc &ast;_tapal_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-3-101-PWOc-tapal-a)

A second reconstruction is PSS _&ast;ogo_ 'tooth-blackening powder' (Lau _ago_, Kwaio _ogo_). [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) (reissued 1972):83) described the custom as practised by 'young men or girls, who wish to give themselves airs', although later, (1930: 121) he wrote that "it was said to preserve the teeth and prevent sore gums".


<a id="s-5-4"></a>

### 5.4. Tattooing


[Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 48) points out that tattooing in New Guinea has only limited distribution, tending to be confined to people with relatively light skin. "Where it was practised, methods ranged from the cutting of fine lines with obsidian, after which pigment was rubbed in, to the use of special implements. Darker-skinned people practised ornamental cicatrisation." Although no POc reconstruction has been made for the activity, reflexes of POc _&ast;saRum_ (see [§3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:1-4)) indicate that a tattooing needle of bat's bone was known in both eastern and western Oceanic as well as the Admiralties. In the east Oceanic region tattooing is widespread. It was practised most extensively and reached its highest artistic development in Polynesia. A needle of bat or bird bone was tapped repetitively with a mallet, and a dye, probably of vegetable origin, rubbed into the punctured area. (Maoris used a dye made from the oily smoke of burning nut kernels. In Bellona the sap of the _ŋieemuŋii_ tree—_Canarium harveyi_—was collected, allowed to set, burnt and the carbon collected and scraped into a black powder ([Tickle 1977](Source#cldf:Tickle1977): 11)). A group of Samoic Outliers (Anuta, Luangiua, Takuu, Tikopia) use reflexes of PPn _&ast;matau_ 'axe' to refer to their tattooing chisel.


<a id="p-102"></a>

The term tattoo is Polynesian in origin:

[PPn &ast;_tatau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-4-102-PPn-tatau-a)

A different term for tattooing is reflected in some Southeast Solomonic and Micronesian languages.

[PEOc &ast;_make_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-4-102-PEOc-make-a)


<a id="s-5-4-1"></a>

#### 5.4.1. Design


[Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996c) ([1996c](Source#cldf:Ross1996c)) has reconstructed a verb, _&ast;noŋo_ 'decorate', used with reference to putting patterns onto pots and other articles, and for tattooing, but his supporting data are limited to three reflexes, and the reconstruction must be deemed tentative.

[POc &ast;_noŋo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-4-102-POc-noo-a)

The kinds of designs used in tattooing, as on pottery and carved objects, and to a more limited extent on baskets and mats, are a substantial study in themselves. Ross has identified one pattern which reflects a familiar pattern in nature, the fishbone, and is found across a range of crafts.

### 5.5. Ornaments


[Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 47) describes the situation in the New Guinea area:

> Perhaps the most common everyday ornaments were necklaces of shell or animal teeth, bracelets and armbands of a variety of materials, most often worn above the elbow, and ear ornaments. Noses were usually pierced, but it is not clear how often nose ornaments were worn. The other very common ornaments were leg bands, worn below the knee, and anklets; belts and girdles; and hair ornaments, including ornamental combs. Aromatic herbs were commonly stuck onto armbands and into the hair; feathers too, unmodified or made into simple ornaments, were often stuck into the hair.

[Spriggs](Source#cldf:Spriggs1997a) ([1997a](Source#cldf:Spriggs1997a): 88) lists the distinctive range of shell ornaments recovered from Lapita sites such as Eloaua in the Admiralties, Balof (New Ireland) and Arawe Islands south-west of New Britain. They include Conus shell rectangular units, beads, rings and disks, _Tridacna_ rings, Spondylus beads and long units and _Trochus_ armrings. Reconstructions have been possible for armlets, pearlshell ornaments, ear decorations and for the act of stringing together a necklace.

<a id="p-104"></a>

Although these examples are in theory sufficient to justify attributing to POc _&ast;[la]lak[o]_ the meaning 'bracelet' in addition to its shell meaning (see Shellfish, vol. 3), we cannot know if both meanings were genuine inheritances in the daughter languages, or were simply associations independently made.

A similar reconstruction, referring both to a particular shell and to an ornament typically made from it, is POc _&ast;japi_.

[POc &ast;_japi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-5-5-104-POc-japi-a)

Shell items were evidently used not only for decoration but also strung together as a form of wealth. [Seligman](Source#cldf:Seligman1910) ([1910](Source#cldf:Seligman1910):514) writes of the Southern Massim:[^9]

> [_Sapisapi_] is a widely distributed name for the small red or purple discs made from the lip of a bivalve shell which I believe is _Chama pacifica_. There are various qualities of _sapisapi_, and these discs are worn singly as earrings (on a ring of turtle shell), or made up into such standard ornaments as _bagi_ or the necklaces called _samakupa_ at Tubetube. _Bagi_ are always imported and never made locally either at Tubetube or Milne Bay, in both of which localities they constitute the most valuable portable property a man can acquire.

We have not reconstructed a word for 'necklace', but we can reconstruct the verb used to describe stringing things together to make one.

[__Figure 14:__ POc _&ast;saRu_ 'comb'](MediaTable#cldf:fig-1-14)



POc inherited _&ast;saRu_ 'comb' from PMP. However, Remote Oceanic reflexes reflect _&ast;seru_, and this discrepancy suggests that a borrowing must have occurred at some stage during the Oceanic dispersal.

## 6. Instruments of communication and music


These fall into two main categories, a) wind instruments, and b) drums. Apart from the conch shell trumpet, the wind instruments recorded in the ethnographic literature are usually of bamboo, although [Blackwood](Source#cldf:Blackwood1935) ([1935](Source#cldf:Blackwood1935): 413) describes a didgeridoo-type instrument, the _mabu_, used on Buka, which is made from the trunk of a small tree. Bamboo instruments are often simply referred to by the term for bamboo. The drums are typically wooden; but occasionally lighter drums are made from larger varieties of bamboo. Where a skin head is required, as in the hourglass drums, the skin of the monitor lizard is used where available. In Polynesia (Rarotonga), sharkskin has been recorded as a drum skin.

Other musical instruments mentioned in the ethnographic literature include Jew's-harps, dancing sticks, a stringed bow and rattles made from seed pods or strings of shells.

In Polynesia the triton shell trumpet is generally known as _puu_, an onomatopaeic word which in many languages is associated with concepts of blowing.


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Bamboo flute


Reflexes of POc _&ast;upi_/_&ast;ipu_ 'blow' or compounds containing it, commonly refer to either the playing of wind instruments or the wind instruments themselves. It is of interest that terms for panpipes from the sets below are limited to the Southeast Solomons. We have no POc reconstruction specifically for panpipes.

### 6.3. Hourglass or kundu drum



<a id="p-109"></a>

This relatively small drum, easily carried, is of wood, with the end covered in (lizard) skin. [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 59) has noted that on the north coast of New Guinea and in some parts of west New Britain the name for the instrument is suspiciously close to the word for 'monitor lizard' (Sengseng _pahiyo_ 'drum', _apahiya_ 'lizard'). Drumming is produced with the hand, and typically accompanies dances. [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) (reissued 1972): 169) reports that "a true drum of wood with skin stretched over it, such as is used in New Guinea and Torres Straits, is not found on Mala [Malaita] and Ulawa".

[POc &ast;_kude_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:1-4-6-3-109-POc-kude-a)

The alternation in gloss between the two kinds of drum is probably due to the term for one kind being used also as a generic. [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991): 60) reports that in Kove _kure_ can be used for either instrument, although there is a separate term for slitgong.


<a id="s-6-4"></a>

### 6.4. Slitgong


Slitgongs are carved from logs hollowed through a longitudinal slit, and beaten on one side of the lip, usually with a single heavy stick. They are often played in unison, with different logs producing different notes. The sound can carry over considerable distances and can be used to convey simple messages, summon villagers, announce a feast or the death of someone of rank and so on ([Blackwood 1935](Source#cldf:Blackwood1935): 409). They are large and heavy, often ornately carved, and will normally survive for many years. They are almost always used horizontally. In the entire Oceanic region, upright gongs, standing on their own, are found only in central Vanuatu ([Crowe 1996](Source#cldf:Crowe1996): 147). In southern Malaita (SES), somewhat smaller wooden gongs are placed on stands and played in sets of three, loosely described as soprano, tenor and bass. These are beaten with short sections of sago bark branches, pithy and soft ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) (reissued 1972): 169).

Although words for musical instruments are candidates for borrowing, the fact that POc final _&ast;-t_ is regularly reflected or deleted throughout the cognate set below is a strong indication that these terms are not borrowed.

## 8. Conclusions


Our reconstructions are for items which draw on a range of raw materials. They include:

- vegetable products (a variety of timbers, bamboo, coconut shell, leaves, vine, cane and bark)
- stone (of variable quality, the most useful being obsidian, flint and basalt)
- coral and shell (_Tridacna_, _Trochus_, _Conus_, clam, pearlshell and others; turtle shell)
- animal products (bone, skin)
- earth products (pigments, earth, clay).

While most of these would be readily available throughout the western Oceanic region, two in particular—obsidian and clay of good, workable quality—are limited in their distribution. Although obsidian and clay pots were widely traded, cognate sets supporting reconstructions are relatively few. The potting term evidence, however, for all its limitations, shows considerable continuity of terms from PMP to POc The paucity of Oceanic terms may be due in part to the scattered nature of pot-making settlements, together with the widespread replacement in recent times of pots by tinware, but is also no doubt due to the long-term disappearance of the skill in the eastern Oceanic region. Although traces of Lapita pots have been uncovered as far east as Fiji-Tonga-Samoa, the manufacture and use of pottery was evidently abandoned in Polynesia early in the first millenium AD ([Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997):68). Fiji is the most easterly place where pottery manufacture survives in the Pacific. In the Solomons, archaeologists have found few traces of pottery other than some scattered remains on Buka Island ([Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997):53), and, more recently, in Marovo Lagoon, western Solomons (Peter Shepherd, pers.comm.).

Nor has reconstructing a term for obsidian been straightforward. As a glance at the glosses will show, there is considerable variation in meaning from place to place, with the obsidian term being used at times for other sharp stones, for a razor, for the head of a spear or an arrow, and as a cutting verb.


<a id="p-114"></a>

As one moves east, from N.W. Melanesia and the Solomons out into the Pacific, the range of plant and animal life becomes less, with coral atolls having the most restricted environments. Shell increases in importance, while hard stone capable of taking an edge becomes rare. Terms to do with mats and weaving and bark-cloth manufacture increase in number and show increased specialization. Tattooing becomes more widespread. These are most likely indicators of developing elaborations after the break-up of POc.

Household artefacts varied greatly in the degree to which they were manufactured. A few—coconut-shell containers and shell scrapers—would have been functional more or less in their natural state. Most items were manufactured to some degree, either with use of tools or through skilful manipulation of the raw material. Axe and adze heads had to be shaped and fitted with a handle; wooden bowls required tools that cut and shaped and gouged, smaller versions of the tools used in canoe manufacture. Mats and baskets ranged from the very simple to the intricately shaped and patterned, serving not only as domestic items but also as house walls and canoe sails. Cordage produced not only bags but also a range of fishing nets.

Pottery would seem to be the household artefact requiring the most complex stages of manufacture. There would have been little need of tools beyond paddle (POc _&ast;tapi_) and anvil (POc _&ast;patu_ 'stone'). However, stages would include preparation of the clay involving tempering with sand, moulding, decorating, drying, firing, and, for some, sealing with a vegetable caulking agent.[^11] One would assume that this kind of knowledge would be accumulated over a long period of trial and error, and probably passed down as an integrated procedure. We know that in more recent times the skill of making pots was a jealously guarded trade secret, not one that could simply be copied by examining the final product.

One further point that can be made about POc artefacts is that at least some of them demonstrated a desire by their makers to produce something that was more than simply functional. Although this point is illustrated most vividly by archaeological findings dating back to POc times, particularly the early Lapita pots, the mere existence of such decorative items as earrings, arm rings and combs points to a desire for some sort of ornamentation, some kind of artistic expression.

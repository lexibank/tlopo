## 1. Introduction[^1]


Reconstruction of POc terms for diseases carries with it a substantial problem. To the extent that descriptions of current languages include disease terms at all, they reflect not only the diseases of the present or near present (such as measles, syphilis, poliomyelitis), but also the medical knowledge of their compilers. It follows that for this particular semantic field, linguistics can convey only a broad idea of the health of POc speakers, albeit one that accords loosely with descriptions given by the first westerners to visit the region.

Although Portuguese and Spanish explorers had sailed along, and sometimes briefly visited the north coast of New Guinea from as early as the 16th century, our first reliable information as to the health of the indigenous inhabitants of mainland New Guinea dates from over three hundred years later when Miklukho-Maclay, in 1871, apparently the first white person seen by the natives of Astrolabe Bay on the north New Guinea coast, noted in his diary: ‘Of these eight Papuans of my first meeting, four appeared sick. Two had legs disfigured by elephantiasis, and one was an interesting case of psoriasis, which had spread over his entire body. The back and neck of the fourth was studded with boils, which formed large, hard protuberances and on his face were several scars, probably of previous such boils’ (1975:19). Later he mentioned that a native from Bilibil complained very much of a pain in the back and shoulders (probably rheumatism) (p.83). He also noted that ‘Digu’s face [one of the first local people to befriend him] bore traces of smallpox. He explained to me that the illness came from the north-west and that many died from it. When it happened and whether it happened more than once, I was not able to find out.’ (p.91).

Other information on the health of early Oceanic populations may be derived from skeletal remains. Our best evidence at present comes from the remains of 36 individuals, 29 of them adult, found at Teouma, Vanuatu, dated to ca. 3100–3000 BP ([Buckley et al. 2008](Source#cldf:Buckleyetal2008)), i.e. very soon after the initial dispersal of Proto Oceanic speakers. Examination of these skeletons indicates that in addition to dental caries, three quarters of the sample suffered from degenerative joint disease (p.97). ‘Because populations were probably small, chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and yaws are unlikely to have been present’ (p.91). Nonetheless, the authors add that ‘the types of rib lesions observed in the Teouma samples are frequently observed in pulmonary tuberculosis sufferers … but can also be caused by other respiratory conditions such as pneumonia and bronchitis’ (p.109). In a separate article Hallie [Buckley](Source#cldf:Buckley2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:Buckley2007):747) argues that erosive arthritis noted in six of these individuals may be evidence of gout.

## 2. Concept of illness


As described in a number of early Melanesian ethnographies ([Romilly 1889](Source#cldf:Romilly1889), [Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891), [Seligman 1910](Source#cldf:Seligman1910), [Fortune 1932](Source#cldf:Fortune1932), [Powdermaker 1933](Source#cldf:Powdermaker1933), [Wedgwood 1934-35](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435)), illness and death were formerly (and in places still are) seen as the result of sorcery, performed because of some perceived transgression by the sufferer. However, there is considerable variation in the degree to which sorcery is implicated in any given condition, in the ways in which it is practised, and the methods by which it may be counteracted.

Ian [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Hogbin1978):47) describes beliefs held in Wogeo, one of the Schouten Islands off the north New Guinea coast. According to his informants, nothing in Wogeo happens by chance: sorcery is believed to be implicated even in minor illnesses. He writes:

> Everybody can list a score or more of common ailments such as headache, toothache, boils, indigestion, nausea, diarrhoea, fainting attacks, sore throat, bronchitis, strained muscles, and fever. …To the Wogeo the cause lies in a mild form of sorcery, differing from that leading to death, and relief demands the performance of beneficient magic to counteract the evil. … Each of the diseases has an associated ritual system, with spells to induce the complaint and spells to cure it.

Hogbin adds that even succumbing to snakebite or a serious accident is attributed to sorcery (1978:51), although he exempts the deaths of infants and those already senile (p.54). However, in earlier writing he attributes the deaths of small infants to spirits stealing their souls, while deaths of adults after protracted illness are put down to breaches of religious taboos (1934:328).

To the Manam Islander as described by Camilla [Wedgwood](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435) ([1934-35](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435):64-65),

> Minor illnesses which are more or less endemic and from which the patient easily recovers, such as colds, coughs and mild attacks of fever, are often lightly dismissed as natural, _imore baia_ (“he is just ill”) they will say, or their attitude might be more accurately represented by saying that, because such ailments are common, of brief duration and show none of the signs which are regarded as serious, the natives do not trouble about their cause. But if a person is seriously ill or is suffering from some abnormality such as lunacy, physical deformity or bad sores which will not respond to treatment, such a departure from the normal condition of good health is believed to be due to a supernatural agency.

Ann [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Chowning1989):222) describes the situation among the Kove, in west New Britain. Here, serious diseases in older children and adults, as well as their deaths from a variety of immediate causes such as accidents, tended to be attributed to sorcery. An exception was death or injury in warfare. The death or sudden illness of young children was usually attributed to attack by spirits, either a ghost of dead kin angry with the child’s parents or a spirit of non- human origin whose territory had been intruded upon by the parents. A similar belief among the Longgu speakers in the southeast Solomons has been noted by [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a) ([1964a](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a):58), who writes that ‘when a youngster under the age of about five succumbs the parents are prepared to accept a verdict of “just the sickness of a child”, resulting from a ghost’s having played with him or her. But all other deaths (including those from what we would call bad luck) are attributed to black magic’.

Hortense [Powdermaker](Source#cldf:Powdermaker1933) ([1933](Source#cldf:Powdermaker1933):293) writes that in Lesu, on the east coast of New Ireland, death, unless it has some obvious cause, such as falling from a tree or drowning, or unless it happens in old age, is thought to be due to black magic. Illness may be due to magic or more natural causes.


<a id="p-336"></a>

A major problem experienced by early ethnographers in obtaining information on all matters connected with sorcery and magic was the natural reticence of the locals when it came to discussing secret and mysterious processes with strangers. Missionaries in particular could be expected to discourage any such beliefs as incompatible with Christianity. In British New Guinea from the 1880’s on, there was also a very real fear of the results of government interference, for sorcery became an indictable offence ([Seligman 1910](Source#cldf:Seligman1910):278). Similar reticence has been noted elsewhere. It may take years for an outsider living within a community to be allowed to know of such matters. Raymond Firth who spent a year in Tikopia in 1928-9, learnt much later that the chiefs had given orders that he was to be told nothing about their gods and ritual practices (1957:8).

Spells whose purpose is to cause illness or death, and conversely, to aid in recovery, are typically guarded jealously, sometimes handed down from generation to generation, at other times able to be bought ([Wedgwood 1934-35](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435):292). Terms for these may themselves carry power and will be used with great caution. Consequently, our knowledge of such practices as they apply to the cause of disease and its treatment and eventual outcome is patchy, to say the least, and an area in which comparative linguistics can play very little part. As I have found, the only terms to do with disease and healing likely to be recorded by wordlist compilers are those referring to natural processes or actions. Almost all reconstructions are restricted to the physical manifestations of disease and healing.

The following sections present reconstructions of POc terms for diseases and healing. Higher level reconstructions are included if known, most from Blust’s Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (ACD).

## 3. Illnesses and afflictions



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. General terms


Of the three general terms reconstructed, POc _&ast;masaki(t)_ (V) ‘be in pain, sick’; (N) ‘sickness’ is the most inclusive in meaning, applicable both to illnesses and other afflictions. In southeast Solomonic languages its reflexes have come to have specific reference to feverish illness, particularly malaria.

[PMP &ast;_masakit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-1-336-POc-masakit-a)


<a id="p-337"></a>

The following set is an apparent PWOc variant of POc _&ast;masa(k,q)i(t)_ with the vowel sequence moving from _a-a-i_ to _a-i-i_, and _-s-_ replaced with _-j-_. Both contain the stative prefix _&ast;ma-_. Lukep, W Kara and Nalik terms below could reflect either POc root _&ast;jiki_ or _&ast;siki_, while the Bali (without prefix) and Bola terms reflect only _&ast;jiqi_.

[PWOc &ast;_&#91;ma&#93;ji(k,q)i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-1-337-PWOc-majikqi-a)


<a id="p-338"></a>

A different term with two variants refers more specifically to aching or throbbing pain. Both _&ast;pitik_ and _&ast;(p,pʷ)idik_ are reconstructable.

[PMP &ast;_pi(n)tik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-1-338-POc-pitik-a)

The reconstruction below is evidently a variation of _&ast;pitik_. It is noteworthy that Gela and To’aba’ita retain reflexes of both forms, albeit with no apparent difference in meaning.

[POc &ast;_(p,pʷ)idik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-1-338-POc-ppidik-a)

Reflexes of PAn _&ast;maCay_, PMP _&ast;matay_ ‘die, dead’ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-5).2) carry a number of extended meanings. POc _&ast;mate_, sometimes reduplicated, evidently included among its meanings ‘be weak or ill’, ‘be motionless, be unconscious’, ‘be paralysed’. As a result, if the meaning ‘dead’ is intended, some qualification is usually required, e.g. Sa’a _mae ʔoto_ ‘quite dead’, Manam _imate tina_ ‘dead + intensifier’.


<a id="p-339"></a>

The antonym of both POc _&ast;[ma]sakit_ and stative POc _&ast;mate_ was evidently POc _&ast;maqurip_ ‘be in good health, be alive’ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-5).1).


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Painful skin conditions


Listed next are a number of terms that refer to skin conditions—first the painful infections that include tropical ulcers, abscesses and boils. The large number of reconstructions no doubt reflects the commonplace nature of these conditions, and indicates that a more specialised POc vocabulary existed for them. However, dictionary definitions do not provide enough information for us to distinguish between, for instance, terms for boil or infected scratch or wound or tropical ulcer, or perhaps terms that might indicate the severity of the infection. All reconstructions are nouns bar POc _&ast;makini(t)_ ‘to be stung, have a stinging pain’, which may have been the verb used to describe an insect sting


<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Boil, ulcer, wound


POc _&ast;manuka_ below reflects PAn _&ast;ma-Luka_/PMP _&ast;ma-nuka_, meaning ‘wounded’. In POc it has become a general term for a sore. However, unprefixed PAn _&ast;Luka_/PMP _&ast;luka_ became the POc term for yaws ([§5.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-4#cldf:5-5)).

[PAn &ast;_ma-Luka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-339-POc-manuka-a)


<a id="p-340"></a>

[POc &ast;_loto_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-340-POc-loto-a)

POc _&ast;paR(a,o)(q)_ ‘boil’ is attested in EOc languages and by non-Oceanic cognates, but appears to have been lost in WOc.

[PAn &ast;_baReq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-340-POc-paraoq-a)

[PMP &ast;_mata ni baReq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-340-POc-mataniparaoq-a)

[POc &ast;_pʷasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-340-POc-pasa-a)


<a id="p-341"></a>

[PNCV &ast;_vosa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-341-PNCV-vosa-a)

[PMP &ast;_bisul_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-341-POc-bisul-a)

The following reconstruction appears to be the same term as POc _&ast;buku_, glossed in [vol.1(85](ContributionTable?anchor=p-85#cldf:1-4)) as ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood, string or rope’, in [vol.2(51](ContributionTable?anchor=p-51#cldf:2-3)) as ‘hill’, and in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-5).1.2 as ‘mound, knob, joint’, where it was noted that the term focussed on the shape of the referent rather than on what it was. In the present instance it denotes a swollen lump on the skin, and a number of reflexes are also used as a verb ‘swell’. However, the alternation between _b-_ and _p-_ across reflexes remains unexplained.

[POc &ast;_buku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-341-POc-buku-a)


<a id="p-342"></a>

POc _&ast;boto[-]_ probably denoted swellings in general, but its meaning has evidently narrowed to ‘sore, boil’ in NNG languages, to elephantiasis in Arosi, and to chicken pox rash in Mokilese.

[POc &ast;_boto&#91;-&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-342-POc-boto-a)


<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Pus


POc _&ast;nanaq_ ‘pus’ is notable for the fact that it is retained in languages right across the Pacific, except in Polynesia.

[PAn &ast;_nanaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-342-POc-nanaq-a)


<a id="p-343"></a>


<a id="s-3-2-3"></a>

#### 3.2.3. Stinging


POc _&ast;makini(t)_ ‘to be stung, have a stinging pain’ is the stative form of POc _&ast;kinit_, _&ast;kinit-i-_ ‘to pinch, nip’ ([vol.1:280](ContributionTable?anchor=p-280#cldf:1-9)).

[POc &ast;_makini(t)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-343-POc-makinit-a)


<a id="s-3-2-4"></a>

#### 3.2.4. Itching


Two formally similar but unrelated reconstructions found elsewhere, POc _&ast;kaRat-i_ ‘to bite’ ([§4.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-5#cldf:5-5).1) and POc _&ast;karak_ ‘ringworm, itch’ ([§5.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-3#cldf:5-5).2 below) each have scattered reflexes meaning ‘itch’. Their cognate sets listed below have been limited here to those reflexes with ‘itch’ meanings. It is possible that the loss of POc final consonants in many languages and the close association between (insect) ‘bite’ and ‘itch’ resulted in some conflation of reflexes so that the Kaiwa, Numbami and the EOc reflexes of POc _&ast;kaRat_ added to their meaning the ‘itch’ sense of _&ast;karak_.


<a id="p-344"></a>

[PAn &ast;_kaRat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-344-POc-karat-a)

[POc &ast;_karak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-344-POc-karak-a)

A number of languages across cognate sets also use their term for ‘itchy’ to mean ‘sexually excited’ (Gedaged, Buang, Yabem and Bukawa in NNG, Tolai in MM, Rennellese and Hawaiian in Pn; [§4.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-2#cldf:5-5).2).

[PAn &ast;_gaCel_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-344-POc-makato-a)


<a id="p-345"></a>

[PPn &ast;_maŋe(s,h)o_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-345-PPn-maesho-a)

Although PMic _&ast;kāSu_ is glossed ‘to scratch’ by [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)), most reflexes support ‘to itch’.

[PMic &ast;_kāSu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-345-PMic-kasu-a)


<a id="s-3-2-5"></a>

#### 3.2.5. Wart, cyst


Certain PMP trisyllabic roots with _&ast;-e-_ (&ast;[ə]) as the nucleus of their second syllable, like PMP _&ast;buteliR_ ‘wart’ below, had in POc lost PMP _&ast;-e-_ along with the second consonant of the resulting consonant cluster ([§1.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-4#cldf:5-5).2), giving in this instance POc _&ast;putiR_.

[PMP &ast;_buteliR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-2-345-POc-putir-a)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Skin infections


Next are skin infections like scabies or the two most common forms of tinea, ringworm (_Tinea imbricata_) and the skin infection that causes white patches to appear on the skin (Tinea versicolor).


<a id="p-346"></a>


<a id="s-3-3-1"></a>

#### 3.3.1. Scabies


Scabies is a highly contagious parasitic skin disease caused by the itch-mite, Sarcoptes scabei, and it is no coincidence that terms for the disease are similar to terms for ‘scratch’ or ‘scrape’, as noted below.

[PAn &ast;_kuris_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-346-POc-kurikuri-a)

[PMP &ast;_karut_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-346-POc-karukaru-a)

Dictionary-makers of Papua New Guinea languages tend to attribute reflexes of POc _&ast;kʷasi-kʷasi_ below to borrowing from Tok Pisin _kaskas_ ‘scabies’. Some reflexes may indeed have a Tok Pisin origin, but the presence of Polynesian reflexes indicate (a) that POc _&ast;kʷasi-kʷasi_ should be reconstructed, and (b) that an Oceanic language is the source of Tok Pisin _kaskas_. The Polynesian reflexes indicate that PPn _&ast;kasi_ denoted scrofula, eruptions around the neck caused by a bacterial infection of local lymph nodes, but this shift in denotation is not a surprising one, as scabies also causes skin eruptions.

[POc &ast;_kʷasi-kʷasi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-346-POc-kasikasi-a)


<a id="p-347"></a>


<a id="s-3-3-2"></a>

#### 3.3.2. Ringworm, _Tinea imbricata_


The English term ‘ringworm’ is a misnomer, as the skin infections it labels are caused by fungi. One of these is _Tinea imbricata_, found mainly in and around the Pacific, and caused by the fungus _Trichophyton concentricum_. It appears as an eruption of concentric rings of overlapping scales which often covers much of the sufferer’s body. The main POc term for _Tinea imbricata_ was _&ast;puni_, which reflects a sound change discussed in [§1.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-4#cldf:5-5).2.

[PAn &ast;_buqeni_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-347-POc-puni-a)

As noted in [§5.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-2#cldf:5-5).4, POc _&ast;karak_ perhaps also primarily denoted ‘ringworm’ and had itching as a secondary sense.

[POc &ast;_karak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-347-POc-karak-a)


<a id="p-348"></a>

Proto Malaita-Makira (SES) _&ast;garat-a_ ‘ringworm’ looks superficially like an irregular development from POc _&ast;karak_ above, but this is probably a chance resemblance. The form _&ast;garat-a_ is a nominalisation with _&ast;-a_ (< POc _&ast;-aŋ_) of a root reflected without nominalisation in To’aba’ita _ma-gara_ (VI) ‘be covered with sores or a skin condition such as scabies’. Its POc antecedent would be †_&ast;garas_, for which we have no other evidence.

[Proto Malaita-Makira &ast;_garat-a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-348-ProtoMalaitaMakira-garata-a)


<a id="s-3-3-3"></a>

#### 3.3.3. _Tinea versicolor_ alias _pityriasis versicolor_ or _tinea flava_


_Tinea versicolor_ is known as ‘white spot’ across much of Melanesia. Caused by the yeast _Malassezia globosa_, the infection leads to skin eruptions. These result in pigmentary changes in people with dark skin tones that leave lighter patches of skin. The POc term for white spot, supported by non-Oceanic cognates as far away as the Philippines, was _&ast;pano_, but reflected in just a few Oceanic languages. Recorded under ‘cf. also’ below are Papuan Tip terms that appear to reflect †_&ast;pana(k,q)_ or †_&ast;pana(r,R)_. They remain unexplained.

[PMP &ast;_panaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-3-348-POc-pano-a)

The set below supports only a PROc reconstruction. The Longgu term, disqualified as a reflex by its initial _t-_, was probably borrowed from a reflex in another (unidentified) Guadalcanal language. If so, the reconstruction would be raised to PEOc. The cognacy of the Tawala term below is suspect on both semantic and formal grounds (Tawala _d-_ < POc _&ast;d_, _&ast;dr_ or _&ast;j_).


<a id="p-349"></a>

<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Yaws (Framboesia)


Yaws is considered to be among the earliest diseases known to man,[^6] and must have been present among Austronesian speakers prior to their movement into the Pacific. The disease occurs in tropical regions and begins as an inflammatory lesion through which bacteria enter the body as a result of direct contact with an already infected person. The disease manifests itself in the form of raspberry-like nodules on the skin which may become deep open sores, and in severe cases, result in facial scars and bone deformity. It is common among children who typically develop sores around the mouth and anus, but confers a degree of immunity so that secondary, more crippling stages that can result in bone lesions are more likely in those whose first exposure is as adults ([McNeill 1976](Source#cldf:McNeill1976):177, 218). Once widespread in New Guinea, yaws is now almost totally eradicated, and terms for the condition have largely fallen into disuse within the last fifty or so years.

Languages in the region would no doubt have had a number of terms for the different stages of yaws and for the disease as it affects different parts of the body. (Babatana terms include _tapae sua_ ‘secondary yaws - ulcers’ (_tapa_ ‘ulcer’, _sua_ ‘child’), _boka_ ‘yaws affecting mouth and chin’, _ŋore_ ‘yaws affecting the nose’, _maqoqele_ ‘yaws affecting bone’ and so on.) A number of terms have been located for the raspberry-like nodules once commonly found in children (PCP _&ast;tona_ ‘skin blemishes caused by yaws’), while some cognates included under reconstructions for painful skin conditions above, such as in POc _&ast;manuka_, ‘ulcer, sore, wound’ ([§5.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-2#cldf:5-5).1), may refer to these sores. Indeed, the unprefixed form of this term, PAn _&ast;Luka_/PMP _&ast;luka_, gave rise to POc _&ast;luka_, the term for yaws. Oceanic reflexes are restricted to the Southeast Solomonic subgroup, but the existence of non-Oceanic cognates (Banggai (wMP) _nuka_, Selaru (CMP) _nua_ [ACD]) with this sense supports the POc reconstruction. The loss of the first _&ast;-k-_ of PSES _&ast;luka-luka_ reflects a regular reduplication process (Andrew Pawley, pers. comm.).


<a id="p-350"></a>

[PAn &ast;_Luka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-4-350-POc-luka-a)

There is evidently a belief among some Central Pacific communities that the marks left by octopus sucker on the skin are similar to skin blemishes caused by yaws ([Geraghty 1986](Source#cldf:Geraghty1986)).

[PCP &ast;_jona_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-4-350-PCP-jona-a)


<a id="s-3-5"></a>

### 3.5. Fever, malaria


Was malaria endemic among the speakers of Proto Oceanic? Linguistics does not provide an answer to this question. Reconstructions carry glosses no more precise than ‘be hot’, ‘be cold’, ‘tremble’, ‘shiver’ and so on, conditions which have a range of causes but are symptoms of malaria. Nor is the malaria-carrying mosquito found in Micronesia, New Caledonia, Fiji or Polynesia. Proto Malaita-Makira _&ast;mataki_ ‘malaria, to have malaria’ is reconstructable, but this is a reflex of POc _&ast;masakit_ ‘be sick’ ([§5.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-1#cldf:5-5)), the specific reference to malaria apparently limited to the southeast Solomons. There are today two main strains of malaria in New Guinea, transmitted by _Plasmodium vivax_ and _P. falciparum_ by way of certain species of the Anopheles mosquito. _P. vivax_ can lodge in the liver, causing a relapse up to two years after the initial infection, and can be easily transported with its human hosts. It is considered to be of Southeast Asian rainforest origin, and, where it is long-established in a stable population, can result in a degree of tolerance in its victims ([Groube 1993](Source#cldf:Groube1993):168, 171). Groube, a prehistorian, writes (p.169) that ‘it would be incredible, considering the proximity of Southeast Asia (the possible homeland of _P. vivax_), if this parasite was not introduced [to New Guinea] before the end of the Pleistocene.’ _P. falciparum_, on the other hand, is of African origin. The resultant illness, although non-relapsing, is more virulent than that transmitted by _P. vivax_. As the parasite cannot survive within its host beyond the duration of its initial infection, it requires large host populations moving rapidly for successful migration. It is considered a latecomer to Melanesia, its arrival ‘unlikely to have been much before a thousand years ago’ (p.168), i.e. more than two thousand years after the initial dispersal of Proto Oceanic speakers.


<a id="p-351"></a>

Almost all verbs in the data with the meaning ‘be ill with malaria’ are from SES or NCV languages. They are either from POc _&ast;malaso_ ‘be cold’ (Gela _malaho_ ‘cold, chill; to be cold, chilly; malaria, to be ill with malaria’, Lo-Toga _mela_ ‘cold, fever, malaria’) or POc _&ast;riri_/_&ast;rere_ ‘tremble, shiver’, variants of POc _&ast;ma-ridriŋ_ ‘(s.o.) cold’. For supporting evidence see [§4.7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-7-6#cldf:5-5) and [§4.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8-1#cldf:5-5).

### 3.6. Rheumatism, arthritis


A single POc reconstruction is proposed for ‘inflammation of joints’, _&ast;ŋu-ŋu(l)_. Although Oceanic cognates are all Polynesian, the existence of a PMP reconstruction _&ast;ŋu-ŋul_ ‘arthritic or rheumatic pain’ indicates that there was a POc reflex. Instances of gout, a disease evidently suffered by Austronesian populations from Taiwan to Polynesia ([Buckley 2007](Source#cldf:Buckley2007)) are in places identified by this term.

[PMP &ast;_ŋulŋul_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-6-351-POc-uul-a)


<a id="s-3-7"></a>

### 3.7. Asthma, breathlessness


Asthma was probably not recognised as a sickness by pre-modern Oceanic speakers, who referred to it by terms for breathlessness. Two POc terms are reconstructed, _&ast;oŋa(p)_ and _&ast;ŋaRa_ (for discussion see [§4.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-2#cldf:5-5)). A PPn term, _&ast;sela_, is also reconstructable.


<a id="p-352"></a>

[PMP &ast;_eŋap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-7-352-POc-oap-a)

<a id="p-353"></a>


<a id="s-3-8"></a>

### 3.8. Coughing


The English term is vague, referring to anything from throat-clearing to severe paroxysms. Perhaps the POc terms were more specific. Two POc terms, _&ast;koso_ (VI), _koso-ŋa_ (N) and _&ast;puku(R)_/PROc _&ast;puRuk_, both glossed ‘cough’, have been reconstructed: for cognate sets see [§4.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-7#cldf:5-5).


<a id="s-3-9"></a>

### 3.9. Diarrhoea


Oceanic languages often describe diarrhoea in descriptive or euphemistic terms (cf. English ‘trots’, ‘runs’), like these three PT languages: Bunama _gamʷa-pili_ [stomach-run], Dobu _diya-salisali_ [intestine-rot/melt], Iamalele _kamo taitai-na_ [stomach landslide-its]. Similarly Sye (SV) _ne-vcah norari_ [the-faeces flow].

Nonetheless, two monomorphemic POc reconstructions have been made, _&ast;surup_ and, less secure, _&ast;sana_. Reflexes of the first are well distributed.

[POc &ast;_surup_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-9-353-POc-surup-a)

The POc status of _&ast;sana_ depends on Kilivila _-sola_ being a reflex, as no other non-Polynesian reflexes have been found.

[POc &ast;_sana_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-9-353-POc-sana-a)


<a id="p-354"></a>

Terms for dysentery are typically compounds that include a term for ‘blood’: Gedaged _tae daɬ_ [excrement blood]; Roviana _pea ehara_ [defecate blood]; Gela _suru gabu_, Tongan _hana toto_, Samoan _sana toto_ [diarrhoea blood].


<a id="s-3-10"></a>

### 3.10. Vomiting


Two POc reconstructions for the verb ‘vomit’, _&ast;mʷutaq_ and _&ast;luaq_, are well-supported, each having antecedents at least as far back as PMP. They are discussed in [§4.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-4#cldf:5-5).


<a id="s-3-11"></a>

### 3.11. Swelling, elephantiasis


Although swelling is a symptom of a wide range of afflictions, wordlists tend to single out one particular highly visible form, elephantiasis. This is the term given to gross swelling of parts of the body, typically legs or scrotum, a late-stage, chronic condition of filariasis. The disease is caused by nematode parasites in the lymph glands of the body, and is transmitted via various species of mosquito including Anopheles, the species also responsible for malaria transmission. Early stages of the disease are often accompanied by severe rigor and fever, and may be mistaken for malaria. Elephantiasis is present in the entire Oceanic region, including Polynesia and Micronesia. The particular form of filaria found in most of Oceania (due to Wuchereria bancrofti) is also widely distributed through the warmer parts of Asia ([Sasa 1976](Source#cldf:Sasa1976)).

One reconstruction, POc _&ast;pʷiRa_, refers specifically to elephantiasis. POc _&ast;tubuq_ is a generic term meaning ‘to swell’, but may be compounded with the relevant body-part term, such as a reflex of POc _&ast;qaqe_ ‘leg’ or _&ast;laso_ ‘testicles’ to refer to elephantiasis.

POc _&ast;pʷiRa_ is reconstructed, rather than _&ast;puRa_, to account for the numerous reflexes that do not undergo the lenition of the initial consonant that is expected of _&ast;p-_ but not of _pʷ-_.

[POc &ast;_pʷiRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-11-354-POc-pira-a)


<a id="p-355"></a>

POc _&ast;tubuq_ may be used for all kinds of swelling, both desirable and undesirable, including growth of tubers ([vol.1:134](ContributionTable?anchor=p-134#cldf:1-5)). A nominalised form, PEOc _&ast;tubuŋa_ ‘general term for swelling’ is also reconstructable, but the initial syllable is lost in Polynesia. For swelling as it applies to boils and the like, see [§5.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-2#cldf:5-5).1.

[PMP &ast;_tu(m)buq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-11-355-POc-tubuq-a)


<a id="p-356"></a>

[PEOc &ast;_tubuŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-11-356-PEOc-tubua-a)

POc _&ast;popo(l)_ (with antecedent PMP _&ast;belbel_), evidently referred to bodily swelling caused by water retention, but only a single Oceanic cognate has been traced.

[PMP &ast;_belbel_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-11-356-POc-popol-a)


<a id="s-3-12"></a>

### 3.12. Epilepsy


Although no POc reconstruction for epilepsy has been made, a number of clues suggest that the convulsions of an epileptic fit were seen as similar to the sudden movements of some birds. For instance, Sa’a has a term _kokoko_ which refers to ‘a bird, the megapode’ and also to ‘a disease and its convulsions, so called in allusion to the startled movements of the megapode when discovered’. Tongan has a term _mahaki-moa_ ‘to be epileptic’ (_mahaki_ ‘illness’, _moa_ ‘fowl’). Wayan Fijian uses a similar metaphor, _manumanu-ni-soni_ (_manu_ ‘flying creature’, _soni_ ‘vine used to trap bats, which struggle to get free’). Two manu terms from SES languages, Arosi _manu_ and ’Are’are _manu susuru_ (_susuru_ ‘?’) also mean ‘epilepsy’.


<a id="s-3-13"></a>

### 3.13. Eye disorders


Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP doublets for ‘cataract’, _&ast;bileR_ and _&ast;bulaR_, both of which appear to have Oceanic reflexes. which have broadened their meaning to include sight impairments and blindness generally and have acquired the additional sense ‘close one’s eyes’. The latter is used as a metaphor for blindness in various WOc languages, e.g. Mangap _mata- i-pis_, Takia _mala- i-tau_, both [eye- it-closed] ‘blind’.

[PMP &ast;_bileR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-13-356-POc-pilor-a)


<a id="p-357"></a>

[PAn &ast;_bulaR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-13-357-POc-pular-a)

A single Oceanic reflex supported by one from wMP permits a POc reconstruction for ‘cross-eyed’.

[PMP &ast;_zilak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-13-357-POc-jsila-a)

Oceanic languages frequently use a reflex of _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye’ with a range of modifiers to refer to various eye conditions including cataracts, squinting, conjuctivitis, trachoma and undifferentiated blindness. For the latter, typical compounds are ‘eye’ + ‘closed’ (see above) and ‘eye’ + ‘night/dark’, although no bimorphic reconstruction has been possible. Pukapukan, for instance, has _matapō_ ‘blind’ (from POc _&ast;mata-_ + _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night/dark’). To’aba’ita has _mā-rodoa_ ‘any serious eye condition that prevents good vision’, and Lau has _mā-rodo_ ‘blind’ (both from POc _&ast;mata-_ + _&ast;rodrom_ ‘be dark, be night’).


<a id="s-3-14"></a>

### 3.14. Deafness and dumbness


The PMP antecedent of POc _&ast;tuli_ evidently referred to ‘earwax’, but the POc cognates extend the meaning to ‘deaf’. Examples with final _-e_ may represent independent instances of lowering of _-i_ to _-e_. For further discussion and a further cognates, see [§3.8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-2#cldf:5-5)

[PMP &ast;_tuli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-14-357-POc-tuli-a)


<a id="p-358"></a>

Commonly associated with deafness is the inability to speak. Two further POc reconstructions are proposed, one with pre-Oceanic antecedents.

[PMP &ast;_beŋel_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-14-358-POc-bool-a)

[POc &ast;_pʷapo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-14-358-POc-papo-a)

The inability to speak that is commonly associated with deafness is in some communities also considered a sign of mental deficiency or stupidity. Note the glosses of the Kiriwina item in the _&ast;tuli_ set, the Ramoaaina item in the &ast;boŋol set and the Kaulong item in the _&ast;pʷapo_ set. Examples from other languages include Yabem _meloʔ_ ‘insane, dull, foolish, deaf and dumb, epileptic’, Tawala _bade-bade_ ‘insane, deaf and dumb, naked’, Kiriwina _nagowa_ ‘deaf, dumb, insane’. Tolai _beg-beg_ ‘deaf, dumb; fool, idiot’, Arosi _bweu_ ‘be foolish, stupid, thick-witted, deaf and dumb’, ’Are’are _peu_ ‘dull, foolish, idiotic, insane, be in a trance, be deaf and dumb’.


<a id="p-359"></a>


<a id="s-3-15"></a>

### 3.15. Tooth decay and toothache


There is a widespread belief among Austronesian speakers that dental caries is caused by a small worm. Both the creature and the associated condition are named in different languages by reflexes of various reconstructed terms for ‘worm’. Blust comments on two WMP languages, Cebuano and Malagasy, whose reflexes of PAn _&ast;qulej_ ‘maggot’ refer also to ‘tooth decay’ or ‘toothache, supposed to be occasioned by a small worm in the tooth’ (ACD). Other wMP languages refer to tooth decay by reflexes of PMP _&ast;bukbuk_ ‘weevil that infests wood, bamboo, and rice; dust produced by the boring of this insect; tooth decay’ (ACD). Dobu (PT) has a term _kimʷata_ ‘the supposed insect which causes caries in children’, from _mʷata_ ‘snake’. The To’aba’ita (SES) term is _wā-lifo_ ‘tooth decay, believed to be caused by worms’ (_wā_ ‘worm, grub, maggot, caterpillar, larva’, _lifo_ ‘tooth’). Codrington also reports the belief as existing in the Banks Islands (NCV), but gives no terms (1891:193).

In some languages toothache is referred to simply by a compound, ‘tooth’ + ‘pain’ or similar.


<a id="s-3-16"></a>

### 3.16. Giddiness


Cognates from Seimat and Tolai support POc _&ast;ta-lili_ ‘(be) dizzy’ (PMP _&ast;ta-_ SPONTANEOUS; [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-5).4) while Polynesian cognates support PPn _&ast;lili-ka_ (POc _&ast;-ka_ adjective formative). Other terms reflect _&ast;lili_ in combination with still other affixes. Western Micronesian languages reflect a stem _&ast;aliali_, which presumably arose as a variant of _&ast;lili_.

[POc &ast;_lili_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-16-359-POc-lili-a)

[PWMic &ast;_mʷa-ali-ali_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-16-359-PWMic-maaliali-a)

Many Oceanic languages use an eye-related metaphor, especially ‘eye’ + spin’.

[5-5-3-16-359-adm-seimat-pulatalitalia](cf.csv#cldf:5-5-3-16-359-adm-seimat-pulatalitalia)


<a id="p-360"></a>

PPn had the term _&ast;[ni]nimo_ for dizziness or vertigo.

<a id="s-3-17"></a>

### 3.17. Club-footed


Club foot is a relatively common congenital deformity whereby the affected foot appears to have been rotated internally at the ankle. It is seen rarely in western communities because it is successfully treated in early childhood, but without treatment people with club feet often appear to walk on their ankles or on the sides of their feet.

The only cognate set with this meaning allows a PCP reconstruction.

[PCP &ast;_sape_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-3-17-360-PCP-sape-a)


<a id="s-3-18"></a>

### 3.18. Madness


In [§5.3.14](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-14#cldf:5-5) it was noted that the inability to speak that is commonly associated with deafness is in some communities considered a sign of mental deficiency or stupidity. Communities will also have a term for someone whose behaviour is considered suddenly abnormal. Although its reflexes are not widely distributed, POc _&ast;ŋau_ ‘crazy’ can be reconstructed. PPn _&ast;fasa_ ‘mad, crazy’ is also reconstructable.

## 4. Healing



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Natural healing


Healing may occur naturally, without human intervention. POc _&ast;mapo_ ‘heal, be healed, cured’ is well supported across major subgroups, with particular application to wounds and sores, although in some languages its reflexes refer also to recovery from illness.

[POc &ast;_mapo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-1-361-POc-mapo-a)


<a id="p-362"></a>


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Assisted healing


Just as communities attributed some illnesses to natural processes and others to the result of sorcery, so their treatments dealt with both magical and practical aspects of the condition, and the two are sometimes difficult to separate. Practical treatment may have included application of herbal remedies both by ingestion and in external use, and massage. Focus here is on the physical treatment given, rather than on investigation and removal of the cause.

Ways of effecting treatment were multiple, varying from place to place and with the nature of the ailment, although some commonality is evident.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. Spraying masticated substances on to affected part


The spraying of some masticated substance such as ginger mixed with saliva from the mouth on to an affected body part is evidently a very old and widely practised treatment right across the Austronesian world. Blust lists, in addition to numerous cognates of PAn _&ast;buReS_ that carry a general meaning ‘spray water from the mouth’, terms from Cebuano and Sundanese (wMP), Asilulu, Kamarian and Boano (CMP) that carry a meaning of spraying something from the mouth for the specific purpose of healing (ACD). In Oceanic communities we have descriptions of similar treatment from Manam ([Wedgwood 1934-35](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435)), Nakanai ([Chowning and Goodenough 2014](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014)), and Gela ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891)). Although POc _&ast;puRas_ ‘spray water from the mouth’ can be reconstructed, a second term, POc _&ast;puRuk_, similar but apparently unrelated, has wider support.

[PAn &ast;_buReS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-362-POc-puras-a)


<a id="p-363"></a>

[POc &ast;_puRuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-363-POc-puruk-a)


<a id="s-4-2-2"></a>

#### 4.2.2. Massage


Another form of treatment involved massage, the purpose of which may have been location and removal of an offending substance ([Romilly 1889](Source#cldf:Romilly1889) for Motu,[^8] [Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) for Banks Islands) or simply to ease a person’s pain or discomfort ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) for Gela, [Whistler 1996](Source#cldf:Whistler1996) for Samoa). It became more highly developed in Fiji and Polynesia. Wayan Fijian, for example, has at least seven terms describing different kinds of massage such as massage by stroking, by kneading, with fingers, with palm of hand and so on (Pawley and Sabaya 2003).

POc _&ast;samo(s)_, _&ast;samos-i-_ ‘massage, stroke’ has few but well distributed reflexes. PROc _&ast;amosi_ seems to reflect the same item with unexpected loss of _&ast;s-_, while most NCV terms reflect loss of the initial syllable.

[POc &ast;_samo(s)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-363-POc-samos-a)

[PROc &ast;_amosi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-363-PROc-amosi-a)


<a id="p-364"></a>

The following term, with POc meaning ‘wring out (liquid)’, continues that meaning in PPn, but PCP has also a partly reduplicated form that refers specifically to massaging.

[PAn &ast;_peRes_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-364-POc-poros-a)

[PMP &ast;_lemiq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-364-POc-lomiq-a)

[POc &ast;_(d,dr)aRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-364-POc-ddrari-a)


<a id="p-365"></a>

[PPn &ast;_mili_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-5-4-2-365-PPn-mili-a)

However, ordinary non-specialised vocabulary may carry a more technical meaning in the context of healing. As Biggs reports for the language of East Futuna, in ordinary speech _vai_, _mili_, _tuluʔi_, _kisu_ mean ‘water’, ‘rub’, ‘drip, ‘spit out’ respectively. In the context of healing, they take on the technical meanings of ‘medicine to be drunk’, ‘embrocation’, ‘medicinal drops’, and ‘spraying chewed up medicinal leaves from the mouth’ ([Biggs 1995](Source#cldf:Biggs1995):120).


<a id="s-4-2-3"></a>

#### 4.2.3. Use of plants


The role of plants in the treatment of illness is not dealt with here, but there is evidence that plants such as ginger (POc _&ast;laqia_, [vol.3:414](ContributionTable?anchor=p-414#cldf:3-13)), and dracaena (POc _&ast;jiRi_, [vol.3:418](ContributionTable?anchor=p-418#cldf:3-13)) were in widespread use, together with lime (POc _&ast;qapu(R)_), [vol.2:64](ContributionTable?anchor=p-64#cldf:2-3)). See also Ross (2008) for more detailed discussion on the role of plants in the treatment of illness.


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Conclusion


Specific POc terms have been reconstructed for a few visible or otherwise readily recognisable disorders – for boils and tropical ulcers, for skin conditions now identifiable as tinea or scabies, for inflammation of joints, for eye conditions like cataracts, and for diseases with very specific visible characteristics like elephantiasis. Reconstructions for a number of behavioural verbs – to shiver, cough, vomit, (none of which necessarily indicate the presence of disease), and states such as itching are included in chapter 4. Terms that refer to pain in particular parts of the body tend to be compounds along the lines of English earache, toothache, headache, stomachache and so on. However, no fossilised reconstructable compounds have been found, but rather lists of transparent descriptions, with elements that vary slightly but are close in meaning. Wordlist compilers may simply not see the need to include such descriptions.


<a id="p-366"></a>

More detailed information on the range and severity of illnesses present in early Oceanic-speaking populations will be dependent on the findings of other disciplines. Further analysis of the Lapita skeletal remains from Teouma, Vanuatu, may provide evidence of diseases such as tuberculosis. Epidemiologists may be able to tell us more about the behaviour of the various strains of diseases such as malaria and elephantiasis, the size of populations necessary for transmission, and the degree of immunity some people may have or acquire. Diseases that were not known to POc society are those where we have some record of their introduction. From the end of the 18th century, parts of the Pacific were increasingly exposed to contact by missionaries, whalers, traders in search of sandalwood, pearlshell, tortoiseshell and beche-de-mer, and escaped convicts from Botany Bay, all potentially carrying transmissible diseases. The local people had no resistance, and therefore had apparently received no prior exposure to such diseases as influenza, whooping cough, measles, mumps, chicken pox, syphilis and gonorrhoea. Diseases such as leprosy, smallpox and tuberculosis which were known throughout much of the world from very early times, were probably introduced much earlier, but whether they were present at the time of the breakup of POc I cannot say.


## Notes

[^1]: Thanks are due to Malcolm Ross who has made numerous additions to the data, and to Matthew Spriggs for advice on current findings on skeletal remains in Vanuatu.

[^2]: e.g. _mahaki-kili_ ‘skin disease’, _mahaki-mata_ ‘eye disease’, _mahaki hela_ ‘asthma’, _mahaki moa_ ‘epilepsy, be epileptic’.

[^3]: e.g. _masaki tinaʔe_ ‘stomach ache, _masaki tuʔa_ ‘backache’, _masaki niho_ ‘toothache’, _masaki ɣotoi_ ‘epilepsy; flinching sickness’.

[^4]: e.g. _maʔi-lili_ ‘shivering; convulsions’, _maʔi-māliu_ ‘epilepsy’, _maʔi-sua_ ‘boil’.

[^5]: Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _&ast;karut_ ‘scrape, rasp’, but the Formosan reflexes mean ‘rake’. The ACD’s Malayo-Polynesian reflexes, however, appear to be cognate with the POc term reconstructed here (Isneg _kárut_ ‘sharpen the edge of a tool by means of another blade’, Cebuano _kalút_ ‘scratch an itch’, Malay _karut_ ‘rasp’). Hence we reconstruct to PMP rather than PAn.

[^6]: Analysis of Homo erectus skeletal remains suggests the disease yaws had its origins in Middle Pleistocene Africa 1.5 million years ago (Mark Rose 1996, Yaws origin. In Newsbrief 49(3), report of the Archaeological Institute of America (www.archaeology.org/9605/newsbriefs/yaws.html).

[^7]:  Samoans may refer to a leg swollen by elephantiasis as _vae-tupa_. [Stair](Source#cldf:Stair1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Stair1983):170) translates this as ‘crab- claw leg’, from vae ‘leg’, tupa ‘a species of land crab with very large claws’. This may be a folk etymology. Curiously, the disease may also be called _feʔe-feʔe_ (_feʔe_ ‘octopus’).

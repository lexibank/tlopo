## 1. Introduction


Body part terms such as those for head, eye, nose, arm, leg, and breast, are among the most stable of all lexemes.[^1] For this reason they are included by linguists in the ‘basic vocabulary’ used, for example, to measure relationships among languages lexicostatistically.

In Oceanic languages, as in languages worldwide, body part terms are used metaphorically, for instance in landscape features, where nose sometimes means cape, mouth means hole or entrance, and belly means central part. It is probably also universal that body part terms are used to refer to location in space, to top, middle, bottom, front, back, left and right. In Oceanic languages internal organs, particularly the liver, are used in expressions of emotion and other mental states where, for instance, ‘to be startled’ is expressed as ‘one’s liver leaps’ or similar.

Glossing reconstructions has sometimes been tricky. There are two interacting reasons for this. One is that some POc terms appear—on the basis of their reflexes—to have had a different denotation from English terms for a similar area of the body. For example, POc &ast;qase- evidently denoted both the lower jaw (the hinged bone and its covering of skin) and the chin (the external shape of the lowest and frontmost part of the lower jaw) ([§3.4.13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-13#cldf:5-3)). Interacting with this is the fact that the English glosses of Oceanic terms are often imprecise, or give a false appearance of precision as when a reflex of _&ast;qase-_ is glossed ‘chin’. This is especially true of words found in wordlists, but it is also true of several of the dictionaries used. Sometimes it is solely the English glosses that are at fault. This is the case with the four POc terms for the region of the neck, the throat and the voice, where glosses remain a little vague because of imprecision in the English glosses in the cognate sets ([§3.4.14](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-14#cldf:5-3)).

Contents are organised into the body ([§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:5-3)), materials that occur throughout the body (blood, flesh etc) ([§3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3#cldf:5-3)), then the parts of the body: the head ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:5-3)), the trunk ([§3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5#cldf:5-3)), the limbs ([§3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:5-3)), the internal organs ([§3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7#cldf:5-3)), substances eliminated by the body ([§3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8#cldf:5-3)) and two incorporeal parts, shadow/reflection and name ([§3.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-9#cldf:5-3)), which are treated grammatically in many Oceanic languages as if they were body parts (they are directly possessed).

### 1.1. Direct possession



<a id="p-76"></a>

Most Oceanic languages outside Polynesia make a grammatical distinction between directly and indirectly possessed nouns, and this distinction is reconstructable for Proto Oceanic ([Lichtenberk 1985a](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1985a)). As discussed briefly in [vol.1:32](ContributionTable?anchor=p-32#cldf:1-2), a directly possessed (= monovalent) noun takes a suffix indicating its possessor (e.g. POc _&ast;qaqe-_ ‘leg’: _&ast;qaqe-gu_ ‘my leg’, _&ast;qaqe-mu_ ‘your (singular) leg’, _&ast;qaqe-ña_ ‘his/her leg’ etc), whereas an indirectly possessed (zero-valency) noun requires no suffix. Directly possessed nouns are said to be inalienably possessed, that is, they are items that usually do not exist without a possessor. They include body parts of human beings and animals (‘hand’, ‘nose’, ‘tail’, ‘wing/fin’ etc), parts of plants (‘fruit’, ‘bark’, ‘branch’ etc), relational local nouns ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3)), and kin terms (‘father’, ‘same-sex sibling’ etc).[^2] However, the converse is not true: not all kin and body part terms are directly possessed. In many Oceanic languages, a monovalent noun must have a possessor suffix or, if the possessor is nonspecific, be linked in some way to that possessor. This linkage may reflect the POc linker _&ast;qi_ (e.g. POc _&ast;pasu qi mata-_ ‘ridge of eye’ = ‘eyebrow ridge’; [§3.4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-9#cldf:5-3).3), but in many languages the linker is lost and a compound occurs (e.g. Nguna _vasu-mata_ ‘eyebrow’). In other languages _&ast;qi_ has been replaced by a reflex of _&ast;ni_, which occurred with a zero-valency possessor noun. It is not clear whether the possessor suffix or the linker was obligatory in Proto Oceanic ([Ross 1998c](Source#cldf:Ross1998c) reconstructs the construction with _&ast;qi_).

Directly possessed nouns are here marked with a following hyphen, e.g. _&ast;qaqe-_ ‘leg’, in order to indicate that a possessor suffix was/is usually present.

### 1.2. Relational local nouns


Above it was mentioned that across languages body part terms are often used to refer to spatial locations. Some body part terms have undergone varying degrees of grammaticisation in Oceanic languages, a process that had started in Proto Oceanic. Certain terms were used not only to denote a body part but also as local nouns that denoted a spatial relationship to a person or object. Local nouns were a grammatical category in Proto Oceanic (and remain so in many Oceanic languages). They were introduced by the POc preposition _&ast;i_. For example, _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘house’ also functioned as a local noun, and _&ast;i Rumaq_ meant ‘at home’ (on the grammar of local nouns see [vol.2:224](ContributionTable?anchor=p-224#cldf:2-7)–229).

Relational local nouns were directly possessed and their possessor was the person or object in relation to which a location was being established. Thus POc _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye, face’ also served as a relational local noun meaning ‘front’, so that _&ast;i mata-gu_ (_&ast;-gu_ ‘my’) meant ‘in front of me’ and _&ast;i mata-ña_ Rumaq meant ‘in front of the house’ (_&ast;-ña_ ‘his/her/its’). The grammar of relational local nouns is discussed in more detail in [vol.2:235](ContributionTable?anchor=p-235#cldf:2-8)–236. Lexical items that served as relational local nouns, many but not all of which also denoted body parts, are reconstructed in [vol.2:237](ContributionTable?anchor=p-237#cldf:2-8)–257.

Body part nouns which almost certainly also functioned as relational local nouns were POc _&ast;qulu-_ ‘head, head hair’, (N LOC) ‘top part’ ([§3.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-1#cldf:5-3)), _&ast;nako-_ ‘face’, (N (LOC)) ‘front’ ([§3.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-7#cldf:5-3)), _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa-_ ‘cheek, side of head’, (N LOC) ‘side’ ([§3.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-8#cldf:5-3)), _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye, face’, (N LOC) ‘front’ ([§3.4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-9#cldf:5-3).1), _&ast;bʷal(o,a)-_ ‘belly, hollow space’, (N LOC) ‘inside’ ([§3.7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-4#cldf:5-3)).

Occasionally the reverse process seems to have taken place, so that a relational local noun has extended its meaning to denote a body part. Thus a reflex of POc _&ast;siriŋ_ ‘side’ ([vol.2:246](ContributionTable?anchor=p-246#cldf:2-8)) also denotes ‘rib cage’ in Dami (NNG) ([§3.5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-6#cldf:5-3)). POc _&ast;qaro-_ seems primarily to have been a relational local noun meaning ‘front’ ([vol.2:247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8)) but some of its reflexes now also denote the face of a person ([§3.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-7#cldf:5-3)). Similarly POc _&ast;muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after; (canoe) stern; space outside’ ([vol.2:251](ContributionTable?anchor=p-251#cldf:2-8)) was clearly a relational local noun, some reflexes of which now denote a person’s back ([§3.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-1#cldf:5-3)). Whether _&ast;takuRu-_ ‘back’, (N LOC) ‘back’ ([§3.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-1#cldf:5-3) and [vol.2:253](ContributionTable?anchor=p-253#cldf:2-8)) was originally a local noun or denoted a body part is difficult to determine.

## 2. The body


Modern Oceanic languages typically have separate monomorphemic lexical items with the following semantic ranges:

1) the whole body, seen as the complete skin and its contents, and also used of the skin as a
   whole ([§3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:5-3));
2) the trunk or torso—the body without the head and with or without the legs; the main part
   of something, e.g. the hull of a canoe ([§3.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-2#cldf:5-3));
3) a dead body, corpse ([§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-3).2).

Meaning 1 also contrasts on a whole/part parameter with meaning 4:

4) the skin of a human being or animal, as well as the bark of a tree, the rind of a fruit or the
   peeled skin of a fruit or tuber, i.e. a surface covering that can be lifted off piecemeal
   ([§3.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-5#cldf:5-3));

And on an exterior/interior parameter with meaning 5:

5) (in some languages) the interior of the body, the inner spiritual part of the person ([§9.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-2-2#cldf:5-3)).

Below are examples of terms for the five listed categories.

|                  | (1)                    | (2)        | (3)           | (4)                | (5)                        |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------|:-----------|:--------------|:-------------------|:---------------------------|
|                  | ‘exterior, body, skin’ | ‘trunk’    | ‘corpse’      | ‘skin, bark, rind’ | ‘interior, spiritual part’ |
| Mutu (NNG)       | _tini-_                | _anoŋa-_   | _pata-_       | _uli-_             | _lolo-_                    |
| Dobu (PT)        | _oo-_                  | _tolobʷa-_ | _kokowa-_     | _bʷala-_           | _nua-_                     |
| Nakanai (MM)     | _vovo-_                | _kabili-_  | _vata-_       | _kuli-kuli-_       | _ilo-_                     |
| To’aba’ita (SES) | _seʔe-_                | _ʔinafu-_  | …             | _ʔuŋa_             | —                          |
| Mota (NCV)       | _(tarapei)_            | _turiai_   | _tamate_      | _vinitiu_          | _lolo-_, _ape-_            |
| Wayan (Fij)      | _-taba-taba_           | _-aŋo_     | _aŋo ni mate_ | _-taba_            | _aloŋa_                    |

Mota _tarapei_ is parenthesised because it is not clear that its definition (‘body, shape, appearance’) is close to meaning 1. To’aba’ita has a gap under ‘corpse’, as [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)) lists only terms for the corpse wrapped in a mat ready for burial. Wayan Fijian is slightly exceptional, in that it clearly retains the four semantic categories but apparently renders ‘corpse’ phrasally, and uses the same morpheme _-taba_ in both ‘skin’ terms, distinguishing them by reduplication.

To’aba’ita has a gap under meaning 5, ‘interior, spiritual part’. Terms with this meaning are often reflexes of POc _&ast;lalo-_ ‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’ or its short variant POc _&ast;lo-_ ‘inside’ ([vol.2:237](ContributionTable?anchor=p-237#cldf:2-8)–238, [§9.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-2-2#cldf:5-3)). To’aba’ita has a reflex of this term, namely _lalo-_, but it is limited to spatial uses. The reflex of _&ast;lalo-_/_lo-_ with meaning 5 is used in a number of languages in body-part expressions that label emotional and cognitive states, but in some languages it is replaced partly or entirely by other body-part terms, and this is true of To’aba’ita. Meaning 5 is further discussed in ch.9, where _&ast;lalo-_ is reconstructed.


<a id="p-78"></a>

Terms for these categories presumably also occurred in POc, but POc terms for meanings 1 and 2 have proven somewhat elusive.

The story with regard to meanings 1, 2 and 5 appears to be one of reassignment of forms from one meaning to another, especially in PEOc, where (i) _&ast;popo-_, _&ast;tini-_ and _&ast;pata-_ no longer appeared in these meanings; (ii) _&ast;tubuq-a(ŋ)_ reflexes shifted from meaning 2 to ‘spirit being’; and (iii) _&ast;[q]abe-_ took over meaning 2. Further discussion is provided in the relevant sections below.

### 2.1. The ‘complete skin’, metonymically the body


Two PWOc terms are reconstructable for meaning 1, the whole body, viewed as the complete skin, often with its contents. The glosses of their reflexes do not allow a semantic distinction between PWOc _&ast;popo-_ and _&ast;tini-_. The latter is better distributed, but Eastern Oceanic cognates have been found for neither, and a POc term is not reconstructable.

Discussing what is clearly the same concept in Lelek, a dialect of Madak of New Ireland, Richard [Eves](Source#cldf:Eves1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Eves1998):26) writes,

> As in some parts of Melanesia, where there is no generic term for the body as such, when the Lelek speak of the body they speak of the skin, _labantuxu_. … This is not to say that there is no conceptualisation of the body but merely that the skin comes to stand for the body as a whole.

[PWOc &ast;_popo-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-2-1-78-PWOc-popo-a)

[PWOc &ast;_tini-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-2-1-78-PWOc-tini-a)


<a id="p-79"></a>

The formal relationship, if any, between PWOc _&ast;tini-_ above and PPn _&ast;tino_ ‘body, trunk of tree, hull of canoe’ below (approximating to sense 2) is unclear, and the resemblance may be due to chance. The same is true of the relationship between PPn _&ast;tino_ and POc _&ast;tinoni_ ‘man, person’ ([§2.2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-4#cldf:5-3)).

[PPn &ast;_tino_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-2-1-79-PPn-tino-a)


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. The trunk


It is not clear _prima facie_ whether terms with meaning 2, ‘trunk’, originally meant ‘the main part of something’, so that the main part of a human being was perceived to be the trunk, or whether they originally denoted the human trunk and were applied analogously to other objects like the trunk of a tree or the main part of a canoe or the tubers of a yam plant. However, the two terms reconstructed below imply the former.

POc _&ast;pata-_, _&ast;pataŋ_ ‘trunk of human body; tree trunk’ is more widely reflected as ‘tree trunk’ than ‘human trunk’ ([vol.3:89](ContributionTable?anchor=p-89#cldf:3-4)), implying that an extension of meaning to include the human torso may have occurred independently in the Admiralties and Micronesia.

[PMP &ast;_bataŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-2-2-79-POc-pata-a)

POc _&ast;tubuq-a(ŋ)_ reflects a nominalisation of the POc verb _&ast;tubuq_ ‘grow, thrive, swell’ ([vol.1:134](ContributionTable?anchor=p-134#cldf:1-5)), an origin that implies a wider original sense closer to the Iduna gloss ‘body, growth, fullness’ than simply to ‘body’. Indeed, it may be that POc _&ast;pata-_, _&ast;pataŋ_ above and POc _&ast;tubuq-a(ŋ)_ differed subtly in meaning. Getting at the meaning of _&ast;tubuq-a(ŋ)_ is difficult, partly because of inadequate glosses in sources, and partly because in PEOc the meaning had shifted to ‘spirit being’, where meaning 2 was perhaps assumed by PEOc _&ast;[q]abe-_ below. This in its turn had shifted in PNCV to meaning 5, the inner spiritual part of a person.


<a id="p-80"></a>

[PMP &ast;_tubuq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-2-2-80-POc-tubuqa-a)

The following set is based on reflexes from two subgroups, SES terms emphasising bulk or mass of a body and NCV terms emphasising a body’s less tangible aspects.

## 3. Bodily materials


This section contains terms for the ‘materials’ or ‘substances’ which speakers perceive as making up the human body: flesh ([§3.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-1#cldf:5-3)), fat ([§3.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-2#cldf:5-3)), blood ([§3.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-3#cldf:5-3)), bones ([§3.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-4#cldf:5-3)), skin ([§3.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-5#cldf:5-3)), hair ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-3)–8) and all the cord-like bits (veins, arteries, sinews and tendons, [§3.3.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-9#cldf:5-3)) that appear when an animal is being cut up. Treated separately under [§3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8#cldf:5-3) are substances emitted by the body.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Flesh


POc _&ast;pisiko_ denoted human and animal flesh and muscle, as well as cooked meat.

<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Fat


POc _&ast;jiji_ ‘meat, fat, grease’ is reconstructed. The frequent mentions of ‘meat’ in the data below may be read as references to the edible parts of an animal.

Another term applied to ‘fat, grease’ is POc _&ast;moñak_ ‘fat, oil, cream, coconut cream; tasty’ ([vol.3:372](ContributionTable?anchor=p-372#cldf:3-12)).

[PAn &ast;_Sesi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-2-82-POc-jiji-a)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Blood


The POc term for blood was _&ast;draRa(q)_. Reflexes are found in all major subgroups except SE Solomonic and Polynesian. In a number of languages the term for ‘red’ is based on the term for ‘blood’ ([vol.2:209](ContributionTable?anchor=p-209#cldf:2-7)).

<a id="p-83"></a>


<a id="p-84"></a>


<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Bone


Two POc forms are reconstructed for ‘bone’, _&ast;tuqan_/_tuqa-_ and _&ast;suRi-_. The former appears to be the formally irregular continuation of PMP _&ast;tuqelan_. The expected POc form is †_&ast;tuqolan_, but we are inferring that the medial _&ast;-e-_ of _&ast;tuqelan_, phonetically schwa, was first lost, and the resulting _&ast;-ql-_ sequence was then simplified to _&ast;-q-_.[^4] POc _&ast;suRi-_ on the other hand is evidently a POc innovation.[^5] Certain SE Solomonic and Polynesian languages reflect both, with a difference in meaning. In SE Solomonic languages apparent reflexes of _&ast;tuqa-_ mean ‘leg’ (listed under ‘cf. also’) and reflexes of _&ast;suRi-_ mean ‘bone’. Lau (SES) has _suli-_ ‘bone’ and what looks like a reflex of _&ast;tuqa-_ in _ua-sifo_ ‘bone marrow’, but forms with _ua-_ are not listed elsewhere in [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1974) ([1974](Source#cldf:Fox1974)). PPn _&ast;tuqa_ meant ‘back’, whilst POc _&ast;suRi-_ is continued as ‘bone’ in Poynesian languages.

The areas in which reflexes of each term occur (in the meaning ‘bone’) are interlaced across the Pacific, as follows:

| _&ast;tuqa-_         | _&ast;suRi-_                       |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------|
| NGOc (= NNG, PT) | Adm                            |
| Parts of MM      | Parts of MM                    |
| Mic              | SES, TM, SOc (= NCV, SV, NCal) |
| W and E Fijian   | E Fijian, Pn                   |

The interlacing is particularly intricate in Meso-Melanesian languages and in Fiji. The distribution of reflexes in Meso-Melanesian is shown below. Where individual languages are shown, these are in italics. The languages constituting the Bali-Vitu, Willaumez, Tungag/Nalik and Madak groups are listed in Appendix B. Reflexes of the two terms are split across the tiny Tabar group. They are also split across the St George linkage, but this is less surprising, as ‘St George’ is a large group, of which southern New Ireland microgroups and languages, as well as NW Solomonic, are probably first-order subgroups.[^6] Reflexes are also split within NW Solomonic, in particular cutting across the Nehan/N Bougainville (NNB) subgroup.[^7]


<a id="p-85"></a>

| _&ast;tuqa-_                         | _&ast;suRi-_                                    |
|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Bali-Vitu, Willaumez             |                                             |
| Tungag/Nalik                     | Madak                                       |
| Tabar: _Notsi_, _Lihir_          | Tabar: _Tabar_                              |
| St George:                       | St George:                                  |
| _Sursurunga_, _Tangga_           | Patpatar, Label, Kandas, _Konomala_, _Siar_ |
| NW Solomonic:                    | NW Solomonic:                               |
| NNB: _Taiof_, _Hahon_, _Tinputz_ | NNB: _Nehan_, Buka, _Teop_                  |
|                                  | New Georgia                                 |

Why did POc have two different words for ‘bone’? There are two clues to a difference in meaning. The first is, as noted above, that _&ast;tuqa-_ reflexes in SE Solomonic and in some E Fijian languages mean ‘leg’. The second is that in a few languages reflexes of _&ast;suRi_ also denote a bone needle ([vol.1:87](ContributionTable?anchor=p-87#cldf:1-4)). Do these facts perhaps mean that _&ast;suRi_ referred principally to finer bones, _&ast;tuqan_ to larger bones or to all bones? The evidence is hardly compelling, as reflexes of both terms are used of the spine in a few languages. An answer of a different kind is that the two terms were used in different POc dialects. This would entail the inference that the Meso-Melanesian and Fijian linkages each emerged from at least two different dialects. That genealogically separated dialects may become integrated into a new dialect chain is shown by [Geraghty’s](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983)) work on Fijian dialects. In the case of the Meso-Melanesian groups located on New Ireland (those other than Bali-Vitu, Willaumez and NW Solomonic) there is some independent evidence of such a history ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):306–307).

Some Polynesian reflexes of POc _&ast;tuqan_ refer rather to the rough or outer side of a body part, although some compounds refer to backbone or to other prominent bony ridges such as the shin. Lihir (MM) displays two reflexes of _&ast;tuqan_, meaning ‘bone’ and ‘back’ respectively, and the Tangga reflex has both senses. It is of interest that the unrelated Lau (SES) term _ʔogi-_ also means ‘a bone, the back, the outside of a thing’.

The final _&ast;-n_ of _&ast;tuqan_ is reflected among the reflexes below as final _-n_ or pre-final _-n-_ in the PT languages Muyuw and Kilivila and the MM languages Lavongai, Tigak, Kara, Tiang, Nalik and Taiof.

Reflexes of PPn _&ast;tuqa_ ‘back, outer side’ can be used in compounds to identify a part of the body that is seen as the outer or upper side of a limb or other body part, (cf. alo ‘smooth, soft side of a thing < POc _&ast;qarop_, [§3.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-7#cldf:5-3)). The emphasis here has almost entirely moved from bone or bony parts, apart from single examples from Samoa (shin), Tikopia (shoulder blade) and Hawaiian (shin).

<a id="p-88"></a>

Three sets of seemingly irregular reflexes of POc _&ast;suRi_ ‘bone’ are listed under ‘cf. also’ below. One consists of Vitiaz Strait (NNG) reflexes of Proto Korap and pre-Mangap _&ast;tura-_,[^8] a second of Papuan Tip reflexes of Proto PT _&ast;turiɣa_ ‘bone’. These may be irregular reflexes of _&ast;suRi-_ reflecting replacement of the initial consonant through contamination by _&ast;tuqan_. The third set consists of the Nyindrou and Micronesian terms, which reflect POc _&ast;(dr,r)uRi_ ‘thorn’ ([vol.3:125](ContributionTable?anchor=p-125#cldf:3-4)). It seems that this may reflect a transfer of meaning from _&ast;suRi-_ to the formally similar _&ast;(dr,r)uRi_.

### 3.5. Skin


There is a semantic difference between PWOc _&ast;tini-_ ‘body, skin’ above, which denoted the whole skin and metonymically the body, and the reconstructions in this section, which refer only to skin itself, including the skins of animals and fruit as well as tree bark ([vol.3:120](ContributionTable?anchor=p-120#cldf:3-4)). A number of languages (Mota, Micronesian and Polynesian) show _-i-_ for expected _-u-_ in the first syllable.

[PMP &ast;_kulit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-5-89-POc-kulit-a)


<a id="p-90"></a>

The next reconstruction, POc _&ast;pinut_ ‘skin, bark’ closely resembles two POc terms that have been reconstructed for ‘coconut husk’, doublets _&ast;punut_ and _&ast;pʷenu(t)_ ([vol.3:376](ContributionTable?anchor=p-376#cldf:3-12)–377). However, most languages have separate terms for ‘skin’ and ‘coconut husk’. Only in some NCV languages and in Misima and Lihir in the set above is an inclusive term found. It seems that the resemblance of POc _&ast;pinut_ ‘skin bark’ to the terms for coconut husk is fortuitous, as with the exception of the Manam term the cognate set below agrees on _&ast;-i-_ as the nucleus of the first syllable, whilst almost all reflexes of &ast;punut and _&ast;pʷenu(t)_ agree on _&ast;-u-_ and _&ast;-e-_ respectively. A less likely possibility is that POc _&ast;pinut_ was a doublet of _&ast;punut_ and meant ‘skin, rind’.

### 3.6. Scar


Reflexes of POc _&ast;kira(s)_ ‘scar’, which continues PMP _&ast;kiras_, have been noted in only a handful of languages, but they are distributed across three subgroups.

[PMP &ast;_kiras_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-6-91-POc-kiras-a)

A second term for ‘scar’, continuing PMP _&ast;bilat_, is reflected in the data only in the Papuan Tip and SE Solomonic subgroups.

[PMP &ast;_bilat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-6-91-POc-pilat-a)


<a id="s-3-7"></a>

### 3.7. Head hair


As noted in [§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3) Oceanic languages typically distinguish terms for head hair and body hair. However, the two POc forms _&ast;puRu_ ‘head hair’ (below) and _&ast;pulu_ ‘body hair’ ([§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3)) are similar, and some contemporary forms could reflect either. In a number of languages of Melanesia bird feathers are denoted by a reflex of POc _&ast;puRu_ or POc _&ast;ipu-_ ‘head hair, feather’ (both below).


<a id="p-92"></a>

Although there are many reflexes of _&ast;puRu_, they are with one exception limited to two major subgroups, Admiralties and Meso-Melanesian. The exception is Gela (SES) _vuvulu-_. Since POc _&ast;-R-_ and _&ast;-l-_ have merged in Gela, this form almost certainly reflects a conflation of POc _&ast;pulu-_ ‘body hair’ ([§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3)) and POc _&ast;puRu-_ ‘head hair’, an inference supported by its gloss, which includes ‘head hair’, ‘feathers’ and ‘body hair’.

[POc &ast;_puRu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-92-POc-puru-a)

[POc &ast;_ipu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-92-POc-ipu-a)


<a id="p-93"></a>

POc _&ast;raun_ ‘leaf, head hair’ ([vol.3:103](ContributionTable?anchor=p-103#cldf:3-4)) is used to refer also to ‘head hair’, typically in subgroups where reflexes of _&ast;puRu_ are not found. This sense was evidently present in POc, as it is also reflected in non-Oceanic CEMP witnesses.

[PMP &ast;_dahun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-93-POc-raun-a)

POc _&ast;qulu-_ with primary meaning ‘head’ also includes ‘hair of the head’ as part of its extended meaning ([§3.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-1#cldf:5-3)).


<a id="p-94"></a>


<a id="s-3-7-1"></a>

#### 3.7.1. Grey hair


A separate term, POc _&ast;qupan_, denoted grey hair. Although it is not widely reflected in the Oceanic data, it continues a PAn etymon.

[PAn &ast;_qubaL_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-94-POc-qupan-a)

PPn &ast;sina, reflecting POc _&ast;sinaR_ ‘to shine’ ([vol.2:299](ContributionTable?anchor=p-299#cldf:2-9)), denoted grey or white hair, and PPn _&ast;sinā_ (etymologically _&ast;sina-a_) meant ‘be white- or grey-haired’, a distinction lost in languages that have neutralised short and long vowels.

[PPn &ast;_sina_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-94-PPn-sina-a)


<a id="s-3-7-2"></a>

#### 3.7.2. Bald


Of the reconstructions below only _&ast;pʷalala_ is certainly attributable to POc. POc _&ast;(pʷa)pʷata_ is reconstructed tentatively, as explained below. The other reconstructions are apparently post-POc innovations.

[POc &ast;_pʷalala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-7-94-POc-palala-a)


<a id="p-95"></a>

The reconstruction of POc _&ast;(pʷa)pʷata_ ‘bald’ is tentative. Pije _hʷata_ reflects a reduplicated form _&ast;pʷa-pʷata_. Otherwise the correspondence with Sudest vwata is regular. The forms listed under ‘cf. also’, however, do not reflect _&ast;-t-_ regularly.

<a id="s-3-8"></a>

### 3.8. Body hair


Many Oceanic languages have distinct terms for body hair and head hair, although the two reconstructions, POc _&ast;pulu-_ ‘body hair’ (below) and POc _&ast;puRu-_ ‘head hair’ ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-3)), are similar, with some cognates that could reflect either. Reflexes of _&ast;pulu-_ also denote animal fur.


<a id="p-96"></a>

Reflexes of both _&ast;pulu-_ and _&ast;puRu-_ denote bird feathers.[^11] In a number of languages of Melanesia, however, bird feathers are denoted by a reflex of POc _&ast;ipu-_ ‘head hair, feather’ ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-3); for feathers, see [vol.4:273](ContributionTable?anchor=p-273#cldf:4-6)–274).

POc evidently also had a separate term for pubic hair (see below).

[PMP &ast;_bulu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-8-96-POc-pulu-a)


<a id="p-97"></a>

The cognate set below arguably reflects two functions of POc reduplication. The first derived a noun that denotes a multiplicity of an object, in this case many hairs. The second, sometimes with the addition of _&ast;-ka_ or _&ast;-a_, forms an adjectival noun that denotes a property (this process formed various colour terms: [vol.2:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:2-7), 210). It is possible that some or all of these terms are not direct reflexes of POc etyma, but reflect later derivations by these processes.

[PMP &ast;_bulu-bulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-8-97-POc-pulupulu-a)


<a id="p-98"></a>

Many Oceanic languages have no dedicated term for pubic hair and use a reflex of POc _&ast;pulu_ ‘body hair’ ([§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3)), sometimes with a modifier. However, POc _&ast;koRo_ ‘pubic hair’ is evidenced by widely distributed reflexes.

[POc &ast;_koRo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-8-98-POc-koro-a)


<a id="s-3-9"></a>

### 3.9. Veins, arteries, sinews and tendons


The gloss of POc _&ast;uRat_, which includes blood vessels, sinews and tendons, reflects their common cord-like structure rather than their bodily function. This is even more true of the following term, POc _&ast;waRo(c)_ ‘generic term for vines and creepers; vein, string, rope’, which applies to animal and human anatomy by extension.

[PAn &ast;_huRaC_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-3-9-98-POc-urat-a)


<a id="p-99"></a>

It appears that _&ast;uRat_ was the usual POc term for cord-like parts of the internal anatomy. It can be inferred that _&ast;waRo(c)_ primarily denoted vines and creepers, as this is its most widespread sense ([vol.3:74](ContributionTable?anchor=p-74#cldf:3-3)), but was used colloquially of cord-like parts of anatomical items. Below are listed only reflexes of POc _&ast;waRo(c)_ that are glossed with an anatomical term. Given its wide distribution, the extension from ‘vine, creeper’ to veins and tendons was evidently already present in POc. NCV reflexes (under ‘cf. also’) indicate an idiosyncratic change whereby POc _&ast;waRo(c)_ became PNCV _&ast;kaRo_ instead of expected †_&ast;waRo_. Micronesian languages apparently reflect contamination of POc &ast;waRo(c) ‘vein, string’ ([vol.3:74](ContributionTable?anchor=p-74#cldf:3-3)) by POc _&ast;wakaR_ ‘root’ ([vol.3:99](ContributionTable?anchor=p-99#cldf:3-4)) with the result that the data point to the reconstruction of PMic _&ast;waka_ ([Bender et al. 2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) rather than expected †_&ast;wa(r)o_. Outright conflation has occurred only in Pulo Annian, however, where _wāxa_/_waxa-_ means both ‘vein, sinew, artery’ and ‘root’. Other Micronesian languages keep reflexes of PMic _&ast;waka_ ‘vein, artery, sinew’ separate from those of PMic _&ast;waka_/_wakara_ ‘root’ because _&ast;-r-_ is usually reflected as _-r-_ in the latter ([vol.3:99](ContributionTable?anchor=p-99#cldf:3-4)).

## 4. The head and its parts


There is a large collection of POc terms denoting the head and its parts. Terms for parts of the head denote the forehead, brain, back of head (and nape), top of head (and fontanelle), face and side of face (or cheek), eye, eyelash/eyebrow, eyebrow ridge, eyelid, eyeball, ear, nose, nostril, mouth (outer and inner), lips, tongue, teeth (in general, molar and canine), gums, chin/jaw, beard, neck, throat and voice.

There are several terms for the head itself, their cognate sets and glosses suggesting differences in their semantic range. The fact that POc _&ast;qulu-_ ([§3.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-1#cldf:5-3)) also had a number of metaphorical senses (‘chief’, ‘headwaters’, ‘prow of a boat’, ‘first-born’), as well as the more specialised sense of ‘hair of the head’ and a use as a relational local noun meaning ‘top’ suggests that part of its meaning was the position of the head as the highest point of the body. The glosses of _&ast;bʷatu(k)_, on the other hand, appear to focus on its shape ([§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3)).


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. _&ast;qulu_ ‘head’


The most widespread term for the head is _&ast;qulu_. Blust (ACD) comments

> Although only the meaning ‘head’ can be assigned to PAn _&ast;quluh_, PMP _&ast;quluh_ clearly had a number of meanings in addition to its primary use as a body-part label. Physical extensions of this primary sense include applications to the tops of trees, mountains and the like, and to the handles of bladed implements such as knives and axes. Somewhat more striking are widespread reflexes of &ast;quluh in the meaning ‘headwaters of a river’, probably in the construction _&ast;qulu ni wahiR_. … Reflexes of _&ast;quluh_ apply not only to the upper part of objects, but also to the front part of objects (‘prow of a boat’) and to priority in time (‘first’, ‘first-born’).

Its meaning in POc clearly included such metaphorical extensions.

### 4.2. _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and _&ast;pʷau-_ ‘head’


The three POc terms reconstructed below, _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’, and _&ast;pʷau-_ ‘head’, represent a solution to a reconstructive conundrum. We are confronted by two overlapping pairs of reconstructions. The first pair, _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and _&ast;bʷatu(k)_, are very similar in form. They are also close enough in meaning that some reflexes of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ mean ‘head’ rather than ‘skull’. The second pair, _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ and _&ast;pʷau-_, both mean ‘head’, and form a puzzling parallel to POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee’ ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1).

We turn first to _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and _&ast;bʷatu(k)_.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ (vs _&ast;bʷatu(k)_)


[Dempwolff](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938)) reconstructed PMP _&ast;batuk_ and glossed it as ‘skull’. Blust (ACD) retains this gloss, but with a comment that it is problematic, as the only non-Oceanic reflexes are:

[5-3-4-2-103-wmp-malay-batok](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-4-2-103-wmp-malay-batok)

The glosses above suggest the possibility that PMP _&ast;batuk_ meant ‘outer shell’, whether of the skull or of, say, a nut. The CMP terms, in which _ulu-_ reflects PMP _&ast;quluh_ ‘head’ ([§3.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-1#cldf:5-3)), thus had the literal sense ‘shell of head’, i.e. ‘skull’, leading to the likelihood that the directly inherited POc reflex of PMP _&ast;batuk_ was not POc _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ but POc _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’ below.[^15] It is also possible that this _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_ shares history with POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1), particularly if the latter referred specifically to the knee-cap, itself an outer shell—but we have no direct evidence of this at the moment.

It seems unlikely, however, that the formal and semantic similarity of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ is due to chance, and more probable that both ultimately reflect PMP _&ast;batuk_ ‘outer shell’, with _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ an indirect reflex—perhaps a loan from a language that retained PMP _&ast;b-_, perhaps the outcome of a piece of word-play or of some process that the data do not reveal. Such splits in pre-Oceanic etyma did occur occasionally, as attested by the split of PMP _&ast;buaq_ ‘fruit’ into POc _&ast;puaq_ ‘fruit’ ([vol.3:115](ContributionTable?anchor=p-115#cldf:3-4)) and POc _&ast;buaq_ ‘betelnut, areca palm’ ([vol.3:393](ContributionTable?anchor=p-393#cldf:3-13); see the summary of Blust’s [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) discussion there). However, there is no non-Oceanic evidence of such a split. The cognate set supporting _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ is given below, and that supporting _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3).2.

In the New Ireland languages Tigak, Kara and Lihir and Bougainville languages from Taiof to Uruava below, the reflex of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_ means ‘head’. This may reflect contamination by _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ or simple semantic shift.[^16] Under ‘cf. also’ below are reflexes of Proto Central Micronesian _&ast;fatuku_ ‘head’, where _&ast;f-_ is the regular reflex of POc _&ast;p-_, not _&ast;pʷ-_, but these forms are also odd in reflecting final POc _&ast;-k_ with a following echo vowel. These are thus not regular reflexes and may reflect borrowing from an unknown source that retained POc final consonants.


<a id="p-104"></a>

Also below is a cognate set reflecting POc _&ast;[(p,pʷ)atu&#93;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘hard, strong, firm’. We take this to be a reduplication of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, an inference supported by both form (POc attributes were commonly formed by reduplication; [vol.2:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:2-7)–220) and meaning.

In two instances below, Bariai _(eau) pat_ ‘coconut shell container for water’ and Takia _pat-pat_ ‘strong, hard’, there is homophony with the term for ‘stone’, _pat_ in both cases, reflecting POc _&ast;patu_ ‘stone, rock’ ([vol.2:62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:2-3)–63). We take this to be the result of chance. In languages where _&ast;pʷ-_ and _&ast;p-_ are differently reflected, reflexes of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_ and _&ast;patu_ are not homophonous, as indicated in parentheses below.

#### 4.2.2. _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ and _&ast;pʷau-_


As noted in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3), _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ and _&ast;pʷau-_ both mean ‘head’, and form a puzzling parallel to POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee’ ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1). The two pairs overlap conceptually, as reflexes of both entail the sense ‘knob, node, joint’. Formally, all four reconstructions begin with a labiovelar consonant _&ast;bʷ_ or _&ast;pʷ_, and have the same vowels, but the first member of each pair has a medial _&ast;-t-_ where the second member doesn’t. Moreover, the members of each pair disagree in the voicing of the initial labiovelar. The first pair displays _&ast;bʷ-_/_&ast;pʷ-_, the second pair the reverse.

Are any of the four reconstructions related to each other? Near-homophony between terms for head/skull and knee/elbow occurs across subgroups and echoes a polysemy between terms for ‘head’ and ‘knee’ in Tarascan (a Mexican isolate), in several Mayan languages where the term for knee, _nah ch’ehk_, is literally ‘head (_nah_) of lower leg’, and in Finnish where the term for elbow, _kynärpää_, is literally ‘head (_paa_) of cubit’ ([Anderson 1978](Source#cldf:Anderson1978):354-355). Anderson suggests the polysemy is based on structural similarity (rounded boniness?).

A fairly exhaustive listing of known reflexes is given here and in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1 as a basis for answering the questions these forms raise. There are several possible answers, of course. The similarities between the four forms may be due to chance, or the four forms may reflect one or more etyma that have undergone a formal and semantic split, and/or the modern forms may reflect contamination of one form by another formally and semantically similar form.

The most conservative response has been chosen here: to make four separate reconstruc- tions, as there is sufficient semantic and formal consistency within each set to justify this. There are several other reasons for this choice.

[Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)) merges POc _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ into a single set, but the initial labiovelar correspondences do not justify the merger. All reflexes of POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1 reflect _&ast;pʷ-_. All the reflexes of POc _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ below reflect _&ast;bʷ-_. Lynch also merges POc _&ast;pʷau-_ ‘head’ and PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee’, and for this there is formal support. The non-Southern Oceanic reflexes of POc _&ast;pʷau-_ are regular, but the Southern Oceanic (NCV, SV and NCal) reflexes point to PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘head’, i.e. the same form as PSOc &ast;bʷau- ‘knee, joint’. If these two sets reflected a single etymon, however, one would expect some of its reflexes to mean both ‘head’ and ‘joint’. In fact this happens only in Sye (SV), where _no-mpu_ occurs in both sets. It thus seems safer to infer that in Sye the reflexes of the two etyma have merged, whilst other languages have kept them separate. It could also be inferred, however, that PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘head’ is a reflex of POc _&ast;pʷau-_ ‘head’ whose initial _&ast;bʷ-_ reflects contamination from PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee, joint’.


<a id="p-106"></a>

This leaves the question, Did POc _&ast;pʷau-_ ‘head’ and PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee’ arise respectively from POc _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ through loss of _&ast;-t-_? Perhaps, but it seems unlikely, first because loss of _&ast;-t-_ has not otherwise been observed in POc etyma, and second because the seemingly shortened forms reflect initial consonants with the opposite voicing value from the forms with _&ast;-t-_. This gives us four different etyma that display intriguing semantic and formal relationships that remain unexplained.

Further comments on this cognate set follow it below.

[PMP &ast;_batuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-2-106-POc-batuk-a)


<a id="p-107"></a>

Reflexes of POc _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ are also used metaphorically to refer to the upper part of things, e.g. Mota _pʷat panei_ ‘shoulder’ (‘head of arm’). From the SE Solomons eastward there are reflexes with extended senses such as ‘lump’ and ‘knob’, and what appears to be a further extension to denote a weapon with a large knob on the end (‘knobstick’, ‘club’). Polynesian reflexes have either the latter meaning or denote a lump on the human body or a tree.

Note that Malaita-Makira (SES) languages lose POc _&ast;-t-_ regularly. Hence Lau _gʷau-_ etc are taken above to reflect _&ast;bʷatu-_. The items in the set below are from languages where _&ast;-t-_ is retained: its absence, along with reflexes of initial _&ast;pʷ-_ indicates that these items reflect POc _&ast;pʷau-_, not _&ast;bʷatu-_.

The items listed under ‘cf. also’ below do not reflect _&ast;pʷau-_ regularly and have unexpected senses.

### 4.3. Forehead


Three POc terms for ‘forehead’ are reconstructed, only one of which, &ast;raqe-, has a PAn antecedent. POc _&ast;dramʷa-_, reflected in Adm, NNG, MM and Mic, was evidently an Oceanic innovation. POc _&ast;p(u,o)le-_ has a more limited basis, with reflexes from the Admiralties and a cluster of north Bougainville languages. Its medial vowel is uncertain. To our knowledge no contemporary language has two of these terms side by side, suggesting that they reflect dialectal variation in very early Oceanic.

### 4.4. Brain


Two distinct meanings, ‘brain’ and ‘pith’, are carried by the same term in sporadic reflexes of both POc _&ast;qutok_ ([vol.3:374](ContributionTable?anchor=p-374#cldf:3-12)) and POc _&ast;paraq_ ([vol.3:373](ContributionTable?anchor=p-373#cldf:3-12)). Non-Oceanic evidence indicates that _&ast;qutok_ was the inherited term for the brain, whilst the use of _&ast;paraq_ for brain represents an extension of its earlier meaning, ‘coconut embryo’. The link between brain and coconut embryo is further supported by the Mussau terms _laŋasi_ ‘brain’, _laŋasi niu_ ‘pith of young coconut’ and Niuean _uho-niu_, originally referring to ‘the spongy heart of sprouting coconut’, but by extension also to ‘brain’. It is also noteworthy that brain and bone marrow are referred to by one term, _hara_, in Motu, and _oso-_ in ’Are’are.

A comparison of Blust’s (ACD) non-Oceanic reflexes of PMP _&ast;hutek_ with those of POc _&ast;qutok_ shows that the latter certainly denoted the brain and probably also bone marrow, and (non-Oceanic) Ambonese reflexes are consistent with the hypothesis that it was also used for the pith of plants. The sporadic occurrence of reflexes of POc _&ast;paraq_ that denote the brain ([vol.3:373](ContributionTable?anchor=p-373#cldf:3-12)), however, may be the result of independent parallel innovation. That is, the ‘brain’ sense of _&ast;paraq_ may not have been present in POc.

The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ display phonological irregularities. The SES forms have a medial consonant where none is expected, as POc _&ast;t_ is lost in these languages. Tikopia has initial _k-_ where no consonant is expected.

### 4.5. Back of head, nape


The change of meaning in reflexes in Santa Isabel languages below (from Kia to Maringe) may be due to similarity of shape, i.e. from ‘back of head’ to ‘headland’ to ‘island’. PNGOc _&ast;g(i,e)ju-_ is evidently an irregular reflex of POc _&ast;k(i,e)ju-_.

<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Top of head, fontanelle


In a number of languages the term for the fontanelle is a reflex of POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_, which was evidently a verb meaning ‘breathe, rest, be alive’, but also occurred as a noun with the senses ‘breath’, ‘life’ and ‘fontanelle’. The full cognate set for this term is presented in [§4.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-1#cldf:5-3), where it is discussed in some detail. Here just those reflexes that include the sense ‘fontanelle’ are given. Note that the fontanelle provides a visible pulse in a young baby and is thus representative of life. The extension from ‘breath’ via ‘pulse’ to fontanelle is thus a natural one. The fontanelle is regarded in some parts of Oceania (e.g. Arosi) as where the soul entered and departed from the body.

[PAn &ast;_LiSawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-6-113-POc-manawa-a)


<a id="p-114"></a>

POc _&ast;maŋawa-_ ‘fontanelle, forehead’ is apparently a doublet of POc _&ast;mañawa_, related to it by an irregular sound change _&ast;ñ_ > _&ast;ŋ_. Some reflexes of _&ast;maŋawa-_ denote the forehead rather than the fontanelle, presumably as a result of a metonymic usage extending reference to the whole of the front part of the top of the head.

[POc &ast;_maŋawa-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-6-114-POc-maawa-a)

It is possible that _&ast;tubuŋa_ ‘crown of head’ is a nominalisation (with _-ŋa_) of POc _&ast;tubuq_ ‘grow, swell’ ([vol.1:134](ContributionTable?anchor=p-134#cldf:1-5); [vol.3:366](ContributionTable?anchor=p-366#cldf:3-12)), where the hair on the crown is compared to the first appearance of plants above ground.

### 4.7. Face


Although two POc terms, _&ast;nako-_ and _&ast;qarop-_, are listed here, &ast;qarop- was principally a spatial term (a relational local noun; [§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3)) referring to ‘front, face, the side usually seen’ ([vol.2:247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8)) whereas _&ast;nako-_ denoted the body part containing facial features and was only secondarily a spatial term. A third term POc _&ast;mata-_ ([§3.4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-9#cldf:5-3).1 and [vol.2:249](ContributionTable?anchor=p-249#cldf:2-8)) was apparently also commonly used to refer to ‘face’ as well as ‘eyes’.

[POc &ast;_nako-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-7-114-POc-nako-a)


<a id="p-115"></a>

Reflexes of POc &ast;qarop consistently refer to ‘front, face, the side usually seen’ and are sometimes contrasted with reflexes of POc _&ast;muri-_ ‘back’ ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3), [vol.2:251](ContributionTable?anchor=p-251#cldf:2-8)). In this sense they are often used to refer to parts of the body other than the face. Evidence for final _&ast;-p_ lies in phrases such as Tongan _ʔaofi-vaʔe_ and Samoan _alofi-vae_, both ‘sole of foot’, where _-i-_ reflects the PPn linker _&ast;qi_ ([Hooper 1985](Source#cldf:Hooper1985)).

### 4.8. Side of face, cheek, temple


Two POc etyma, _&ast;[pʷa]pʷaRa-_ ‘cheek, side of face’ and _&ast;baba[R,l]i-_ ‘cheek’ appear to reflect Blust’s PCEMP _&ast;papaR_ ‘cheek’ (ACD). However, two comments are in order. First, PCEMP _&ast;papaR_ is supported by only one non-Oceanic reflex (Buru _papa-n_ ‘cheek’), with the consequence that there is no independent attestation of PCEMP _&ast;-R-_ or of the vowel following it. Second, POc doublets are rare, and it is possible that the two etyma have different origins. Both have reflexes that simply mean ‘side’, but it is common for POc relational local nouns to be derived from human body part terms (cf. POc _&ast;bʷal(o,a)-_ ‘belly, inside’, [vol.2:239](ContributionTable?anchor=p-239#cldf:2-8); _&ast;qaro-_ ‘face, front’, [vol.2:247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8); &ast;mata- ‘eye, front’, [vol.2:249](ContributionTable?anchor=p-249#cldf:2-8)). A stronger possibility is that POc _&ast;baba[R,l]i-_ is indeed a doublet, created through contamination by POc _&ast;baban_ ‘flat, board, plank of boat’ ([vol.1:185](ContributionTable?anchor=p-185#cldf:1-7)–186) because of its reference to a bone with a flat surface. Reflexes of POc _&ast;baban_ are sometimes used in this sense (cf. To’aba’ita _baba-leqo_, Maori _papa-āhuahua_, both ‘shoulder blade’), and it is possible that PEPn _&ast;papa-ariŋa_ ‘cheek’ reflects such a compound.[^20]

### 4.9. The eye and its parts



<a id="s-4-9-1"></a>

#### 4.9.1. Eye


POc _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye, face’ appears to have served both as a noun denoting the eye (as a body part) and as a relational local noun denoting the ‘front’ side of a person or object ([vol.2:249](ContributionTable?anchor=p-249#cldf:2-8)).

#### 4.9.2. Eyelash, eyebrow hair


The glosses below suggest that ‘eyelash’ and ‘eyebrow hair’ were denoted by a single POc term, _&ast;pulu qi mata-_ literally ‘hair of eye’. POc _&ast;pulu-_ was the term for body hair ([§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3)) as opposed to head hair. On _&ast;qi_, see [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1985) ([1985](Source#cldf:Hooper1985)), [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1998a) ([1998a](Source#cldf:Ross1998a)) and [§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3).

[PMP &ast;_bulu ni mata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-9-118-POc-puluqimata-a)


<a id="p-119"></a>

Kukuya _mata-ivu_ ‘eyelash’ is a conceptually similar term, but _ivu_ reflects _&ast;ipu_ ‘hair’ ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-3)).

Numbami (NNG) has _mata-lami_ ‘eyelash’ and Nyindrou (Adm) has _lami mada-_ ‘eyelash, eyebrow’, each containing an apparent reflex of POc _&ast;Ramut_ ‘fine, hair-like roots’ ([vol.3:101](ContributionTable?anchor=p-101#cldf:3-4)).

The next set probably shows metaphoric use of a term also used to describe the fringe-like leaflets of a coconut branch (see Arosi, Sa’a, ’Are’are _hisi_, Lau _fisi_). Note that in MM and SES languages the possessor follows the possessed whilst in PT languages the order is reversed.

<a id="s-4-9-3"></a>

#### 4.9.3. Eyebrow ridge


Widely distributed reflexes of POc _&ast;pasu-_ denote ‘eyebrow’, but scattered among them are reflexes meaning ‘forehead’ and, in Vanuatu, also ‘cheek’. Ancestral to the POc term is PMP _&ast;pasu(ŋ)_, which Blust (ACD) glosses ‘cheek bone’. However, in addition to ‘cheek’ the non-Oceanic reflexes have meanings as varied as ‘prominent cheek bones’, ‘upper jawbone’, ‘bridge of the nose’. The common denominator across both Malayo-Polynesian and Oceanic glosses seems to be ‘facial bony ridge’ and this may well have been its extended sense at both interstages. However, its narrower PMP meaning does indeed seem to have been ‘cheek bone’. This was perhaps also its narrower POc gloss, with a semantic shift to ‘eyebrow ridge’, then ‘eyebrow’, in various daughter-languages. In this light, complex expressions for ‘eyebrow’ below which include a reflex of POc &ast;mata- ‘eye’ ([§3.4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-9#cldf:5-3).1) apparently meant ‘ridge of eye’, i.e. ‘eyebrow ridge’, as opposed to other facial ridges, particularly the cheek bone.

The compound forms in Loniu, Port Sandwich, Nguna, Iaai and Rotuman all point to POc _&ast;pasu-mata-_, but Nokuku _pus-pusa-n meta-_ contains a suffix _-n_ which reflects either POc _&ast;-ña_ ‘his, her, its’ or _&ast;ni_, a morpheme that marked the following noun phrase as the nonspecific possessor of an indirectly possessed noun, e.g. POc ? _&ast;pasu ni mata-_ ‘ridge of eye’. This reconstruction is odd, however, as POc _&ast;pasu-_ was directly possessed, and the nonspecific possessor of a directly possessed noun was introduced by _&ast;qi_ ([Ross 1998c](Source#cldf:Ross1998c); also [§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3)), i.e. the expected form is POc _&ast;pasu qi mata-_. In a number of languages the reflex of _&ast;ni_ has displaced _&ast;qi_, and Nokuku may be one of these.

The eyebrows perhaps had a particular cultural significance for Proto Oceanic speakers. The Sinaugoro and Nguna terms below refer to raising the eyebrows to say ‘yes’, and it seems likely that the gesture already had this meaning in Proto Oceanic times.

#### 4.9.4. Eyelid


Although a possible PEOc compound can be reconstructed from SES and NE Ambae terms which translate literally as ‘eye skin’, there is little consistency of form across the Oceanic region, with a range of terms being used in place of ‘skin’ including ‘cover’, ‘husk’, and ‘leaf’. PEOc _&ast;pinu-pinu_ is a reduplicated reflex of POc _&ast;pinut_ ‘skin, bark’ ([§3.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-5#cldf:5-3)).

#### 4.9.5. Eyeball


The eyeball is sometimes referred to by compounds which include a term meaning something like the kernel or flesh or substance of the eye. Reflexes of POc _&ast;kanoŋ_ ‘flesh, meat, coconut flesh’ ([vol.3:370](ContributionTable?anchor=p-370#cldf:3-12)) combined with reflexes of _&ast;mata_ ‘eye’ are used to refer to ‘eyeball’ in a number of languages, pointing to POc _&ast;kanoŋ qi mata_ ‘eyeball’.

### 4.10. Ear


POc _&ast;taliŋa-_ was not only the term for ‘ear’ but also the generic term for mushrooms and fleshy fungi ([vol.3:78](ContributionTable?anchor=p-78#cldf:3-3)). The association between the two was presumably based either on visual similarity or on the fact that fungi often grow on trees in the rain forest just as ears appear to grow on the side of the human head. That the association had a conceptual basis is attested by the fact that in certain Oceanic languages where the term for ‘ear’ is not a reflex of POc _&ast;taliŋa-_, the ‘ear’ term is still the generic term for fungi.

POc _&ast;icuŋ_ ‘nose’ probably also had the senses ‘cape of land’ ([vol.2:47](ContributionTable?anchor=p-47#cldf:2-3)) and ‘canoe prow’ ([vol.1:189](ContributionTable?anchor=p-189#cldf:1-7)).

<a id="p-124"></a>

There is also evidence for POc _&ast;bʷa(l,R)usu-_ ‘nose’. Its SE Solomonic and Micronesian reflexes form part of the evidence on which [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1984b) ([1984b](Source#cldf:Blust1984b), [2010](Source#cldf:Blust2010)) bases his Malaitan-Micronesian subgroup. In the context of the additional cognates listed here, his Proto Malaitan-Micronesian _&ast;pʷaRusu-_ is less convincing as a uniquely shared innovation. Blust dismisses Lou _pursu-_ as a ‘chance resemblance’ on the grounds that Lou _-r-_ does not reflect _&ast;-R-_ (it reflects _&ast;-r-_). The _-l-_ of the MM reflexes here also fails to agree with the Micronesian reflexes as the former reflect POc _&ast;-l-_, the latter POc _&ast;-R-_ (the SES cognates reflect either _&ast;-l-_ or _&ast;-R-_). Whatever the reason for these discrepancies, it is difficult to attribute the resemblances across the set to chance.

This set is rendered more difficult by the presence of a number of look-alikes in NCV languages (a sample is given under ‘cf. also’). Of these, the most attention grabbing is Sowa (Pentecost) _bʷa-ŋsu-_ ([Tryon 1976](Source#cldf:Tryon1976)), where nearby Apma has _ŋusu-_, presumably reflecting POc _&ast;ŋuju-_ ‘external mouth, lips, snout, beak’ ([§3.4.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-12#cldf:5-3).1) and suggesting that Sowa _bʷa-ŋsu-_ reflects _&ast;bʷa-_ + _&ast;ŋuju-_. This in turn raises the question whether the same _&ast;bʷa-_ occurs in the reconstruction below, but the evidence does not allow a clear answer. Araki _ŋalsu-_, Aore _kalsu-_, Lendamboi _na-gars-_ and Nisvai _na-gursu-_ are typical of the Santo and Malakula forms which complicate the picture yet more. None of them reflects _&ast;bʷa-_, but Araki and Aore include the sequence _lsu-_, perhaps cognate with _lisu-_, the term for ‘nose’ in Maewo languages. Is it also cognate with the MM and SES forms? One cannot be sure.

#### 4.11.2. Channel above the upper lip


Although a number of reflexes of POc _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ are glossed ‘nose’ (and by extension ‘cape’; vol 2:48), the term apparently referred in POc times to ‘channel above upper lip’, its meaning transferred independently in daughter-languages. Given their formal and semantic similarity it is reasonable to infer that PNCV _&ast;ŋori_ reflects POc &ast;ŋoro-ŋorok, despite the irregular final vowel. We take _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ to be a reduplicated form of the noun _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘snot’ ([§3.8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-3#cldf:5-3)) and/or the verb _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘grunt, growl, snore’ ([§4.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-3#cldf:5-3)).

### 4.12. The mouth and its parts


Four POc terms referring to the mouth have been reconstructed: _&ast;ŋuju-_, _&ast;[pʷa]pʷa(q)_, _&ast;qawa_ and _&ast;maŋa_. POc _&ast;ŋuju-_ probably referred to the external mouth and lips, its reflexes sometimes extending to bird’s beak or nose, while POc _&ast;[pʷa]pʷa(q)_ referred to the inner mouth or opening and _&ast;qawa_ perhaps had the broader meaning ‘opening into a passage or channel’. POc _&ast;maŋa_ may have referred more broadly to an opening. Other extensions of its meaning are to a particularly shaped opening such as a slit or vagina, or opening as in a passage through a reef.


<a id="s-4-12-1"></a>

#### 4.12.1. External mouth


Blust (ACD) glosses PAn _&ast;ŋusuq_ ‘nasal area, snout’. We add ‘mouth’ here, as glosses referring to ‘mouth’ are found across Austronesian subgroups.

#### 4.12.2. Lips


The data support two POc reconstructions for ‘lips’, _&ast;[pi]piRi-_ and _&ast;[bi]biRi-_, both reflecting PAn _&ast;biRbiR_, PMP _&ast;bibiR_. As noted in [vol.2(18](ContributionTable?anchor=p-18#cldf:2-2)), PMP _&ast;b_ became either POc _&ast;p_ or POc _&ast;b_, in initial position more commonly _&ast;p-_. In almost every instance Oceanic cognates reflect either POc _&ast;p-_ or POc _&ast;b-_, but not both. In this instance, however, PMP _&ast;bibiR_ has given rise to two etyma, POc _&ast;[pi]piRi-_ and POc _&ast;[bi]biRi-_. We have no explanation for PWOc _&ast;b-_ in this instance.

#### 4.12.3. Inner mouth


Terms for the inner mouth denote the opening and the cavity rather than the lips, and are often used of the opening and inside of a vessel.

[POc &ast;_qawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-12-129-POc-qawa-a)

Finally, some Oceanic languages have a term for ‘mouth’ that reflects POc _&ast;maŋa(p)_ (V) ‘to open wide, gape’, (N) ‘open mouth; gap, space’. The supporting cognate set is given in [§4.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-5#cldf:5-3). POc _&ast;maŋa(p)_ in its turn reflected PMP _&ast;q⟨um⟩aŋa[p,b]_ ‘gape, open the mouth wide’ (where _&ast;⟨um⟩_ was the PMP actor voice infix; [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-3).5). Blust (ACD) attributes two of these reflexes, Arosi _maŋa_ ‘an opening, mouth’ and Bauan Fijian _maŋa_ ‘vagina’, to PMP _&ast;maŋaq_ ‘slit, crevice’ (ACD). However, the glosses of the set of Oceanic reflexes in [§4.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-5#cldf:5-3) include a range of meanings centring on ‘opening, aperture’ (‘mouth’, ‘vagina’, ‘space between earth and sky’), pointing to a more probable origin in PMP _&ast;q⟨um⟩aŋa[p,b]_ rather than PMP _&ast;maŋaq_. But, since the two PMP terms would have had near-identical POc reflexes, one could argue that the cognate set supporting POc _&ast;maŋa(p)_ reflects a conflation of the two terms.

#### 4.12.4. Tongue


There are two related POc reconstructions for ‘tongue’, _&ast;maya-_ and a compound that includes it, _&ast;kara-maya-_. The origin of _&ast;kara-_ in the latter is unknown.

Most reflexes of _&ast;maya-_ entail a reduction of _&ast;-ay-_ or _&ast;-ya-_ to _-e-_, but the Bariai, Kilivila and Roro reflexes point to _&ast;maya-_. The compound is reconstructed as _&ast;kara-maya-_ rather than _&ast;kara-mea-_, on the model of _&ast;maya-_.

#### 4.12.5. Teeth


POc _&ast;nipo-_ and POc _&ast;lipo-_ ‘tooth’ coexisted. Both _&ast;n-_ and _&ast;l-_ forms are reconstructable at least as far back as PAn, and both must be attributed to POc. The fact that the two forms have existed side by side for such a long time is intriguing, as there is no difference in meaning. Kwaio is the only language among the data sources that reflects both.

In a number of languages the term for teeth is a reflex of POc _&ast;ŋisi_ or _&ast;[ŋi]ŋisa_, both glossed ‘bare one’s teeth, grin’. Since these forms were evidently verbs, they are discussed in [§4.7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-7-2#cldf:5-3).

[PMP &ast;_baReqaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-12-133-POc-para-a)

With regard to the relationship between PMP _&ast;baReqaŋ_ and POc _&ast;paRa(ŋ)_ Blust (ACD) notes that

> medial _&ast;-e-_ in a trisyllable is retained in PAn _&ast;baqeRu_ > POc _&ast;paqoRu_ ‘new’. The suggested loss of PMP _&ast;e_ and reduction of the resulting consonant cluster in POc _&ast;paRaŋ_ ‘molar tooth’ may indicate very specific conditions for deletion of _&ast;e_ between PMP and POc. Alternatively, the resemblance of Arosi hara to phonetically and semantically similar forms in non-Oceanic languages may be due to chance.

However, the occurrence of the Lukep and Tuam forms alongside Arosi _hara-_ indicates that the resemblance is not fortuitous.

Two further vaguely similar reconstructions for ‘molar tooth’ can be reconstructed. In the set reflecting _&ast;ŋaRo-_ the gloss of Misima _nalu-_ ‘gums’ suggests that it reflects POc _&ast;ŋado-_ ‘gums’ ([§3.4.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-12#cldf:5-3).6), but this is probably a case of contamination of one form by the other. Note in any case that two reflexes of PWOc _&ast;mʷao-_ ‘molar tooth’ below instead denote the gums, i.e. this is perhaps a fairly common extension of meaning.

#### 4.12.6. Gums


POc _&ast;ŋado-_ ‘gums’ bears an obvious resemblance to _&ast;ŋaRo-_ ‘molar tooth’ above, but the difference in medial consonant and in gloss indicate that they are distinct.

### 4.13. Chin, jaw and beard


Austronesian languages usually lack separate words for ‘chin’, i.e. the outward shape of the lowest and frontmost part of the lower jaw, and the lower ‘jaw’ itself. They are typically denoted in Oceanic languages by a reflex of POc _&ast;qase-_ or by a compound that apparently contains a reflex of POc _&ast;qase-_. PPn _&ast;kau-qahe_ ‘cheek, chin, jawbone’ is evidently such a compound. PPn _&ast;kau_ meant ‘edge, side’, and _&ast;kau-qahe_ presumably once meant ‘edge of jaw’, i.e. ‘chin’, but with the loss of PPn _&ast;qahe_ ‘jaw’, _&ast;kau-qahe_ came to subsume ‘chin’ and ‘jaw’. Another possible compound, POc _&ast;(k,g)abase-_ ‘chin; jawbone’, is discussed below.


<a id="p-135"></a>

The term for ‘beard’, POc _&ast;kumi-_, was clearly distinct from the term for ‘chin, jaw’, but its meaning has been extended to include the latter in a number of languages.

[PMP &ast;_qazay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-13-135-POc-qaseqase-a)


<a id="p-136"></a>

POc _&ast;(k,g)abase-_ ‘chin; jawbone’ at first sight appears to have been a compound of _&ast;(k,g)abV_ (meaning unknown) and _&ast;qase-_ ‘chin, jaw’, but only the Lou and Baluan reflexes straightfowardly reflect the reconstructed vowels (and disagree on the initial consonant). Bipi and the Meso-Melanesian reflexes instead reflect a possible POc _&ast;(k,g)abesi-_ or _&ast;(k,g)abise-_, suggesting that the POc form was a trisyllable with perhaps three different vowels (apparently _&ast;a_, _&ast;i_ and _&ast;e_) which underwent various metatheses and/or assimilations.

### 4.14. Neck, throat, voice


Modern Oceanic languages typically have four separate monomorphemic lexical items denoting parts of the neck region: ‘neck’ (viewed from the outside), ‘voice’, ‘throat’ (inside the neck) and ‘nape’ (back of neck/base of skull’). For ‘nape’, see [§3.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-5#cldf:5-3). Examples of the first three terms are given below. Some languages also have monomorphemic terms for the Adam’s apple and the gullet, but sources typically omit these meanings.

|                  | ‘neck’   | ‘voice’   | ‘throat’       |
|:-----------------|:---------|:----------|:---------------|
| Mutu (NNG)       | _lua-_   | _aliŋa-_  | _ᵑgarusa-_     |
| Dobu (PT)        | _ʔoto-_  | _ʔena-_   | _maga-_        |
| Nakanai (MM)     | _holo-_  | _vigia-_  | _golu-_        |
| To’aba’ita (SES) | _lua-_   | _liŋa-_   | _lua-_         |
| Wayan (Fij)      | _-domo_  | _-lio_    | _-ŋodro-ŋodro_ |
| Tongan (Pn)      | _kia_    | _leʔo_    | _moŋa_         |

The most detailed source available to us is [Pawley & Sayaba’s](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)) dictionary of Wayan Fijian, according to which _-domo_ ‘neck’ is also used for voice, overlapping semantically with _-lio_ (both terms are also used of animal vocalisations). Doubtless overlaps of the kind indicated by the definitions of the Wayan terms also occur in other Oceanic languages but are not recorded by our sources. The only language here to collapse two of these terms is To’aba’ita, where the meaning of _lua-_, originally ‘neck’ (from POc _&ast;Ruqa-_), has been extended to ‘throat’, presumably after a period of overlap.

Evidently POc also had a three-way distinction among ‘neck’, ‘voice’ and ‘throat’, but four terms are reconstructed. The assignment of the first three is straightforward, but the meaning of _&ast;kadro-_ is problematic (see below).

-   _&ast;Ruqa-_ ‘neck’
-   _&ast;[qa]liŋa-_ ‘voice’
-   _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘throat’
-   _&ast;kadro-_ ‘neck ?’

_&ast;Ruqa-_ ‘neck’ has largely retained its meaning throughout all subgroups, although isolated terms have extended or relocated reference to nearby body parts.

[POc &ast;_Ruqa-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-14-137-POc-ruqa-a)


<a id="p-138"></a>

POc _&ast;[qa]liŋa-_ ‘voice’ is reflected in languages as far east as the southeast Solomons, but its reflexes are not found further east. East and south of the Solomons, the term for voice is a reflex of POc _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘throat’.

Even closely related languages vary as to whether _&ast;qa-_ is included.[^24]

[POc &ast;_&#91;qa&#93;liŋa-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-14-138-POc-qalia-a)


<a id="p-139"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ mean ‘neck’ or ‘throat’ in languages as far east as the southeast Solomons, but in languages further east refer consistently to ‘voice’. Initial _&ast;qa-_ in _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ is reflected only in NNG and PT (i.e. NGOc) languages. PNCV _&ast;le(q)o_ ‘word, speech, voice’ and PPn _&ast;leqo_ ‘voice’ are reflexes of POc _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘neck, throat’. PNCV _&ast;daleqo_ ‘neck, throat; voice’ remains unaccounted for, other than to note its similarity to POc _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘neck, throat’.

[PAn &ast;_liqeR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-14-139-POc-qaliqor-a)


<a id="p-140"></a>

The relationship, if any, between POc _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘neck, throat’ and PNCV _&ast;daleqo-_ ‘neck, throat; voice’ is not understood.

[PNCV &ast;_daleqo-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-4-14-140-PNCV-daleqo-a)

POc _&ast;kadro-_ ‘neck’ has reflexes only in Mussau and Western Oceanic, and seems to have referred to the neck region generally, to judge from the compound terms for its parts in Mussau and Motu. Thus it appears to have been a (near-)synonym of POc _&ast;Ruqa-_.

## 5. Parts of the trunk


Terms for the trunk itself are given alongside those for ‘body’ in [§3.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-2#cldf:5-3). Terms for the parts of the torso or trunk are arranged such that those for the back are presented first, followed by those for parts of the trunk moving from the top (shoulder) to the bottom (buttocks and genitalia).


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Back


POc _&ast;takuRu-_ ‘back’ clearly denoted a location, i.e. the posterior surface of an object, and specifically the posterior surface of the human body. But did it also denote the spine as a body part? The answer appears to be ‘no’, in that very few glosses of its reflexes include ‘spine’ or ‘backbone’ (often encoded with a compound involving the term for ‘bone’), and Oceanic languages typically have separate terms for back and backbone.

Another reconstruction sometimes used to refer to the back as a body part is the relational local noun POc _&ast;muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after; (canoe) stern; space outside’ ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3) and [vol.2:251](ContributionTable?anchor=p-251#cldf:2-8)).

### 5.2. Flat of back


No POc term is reconstructable for ‘flat of back’. PPn _&ast;papa_ in _&ast;papa-a-tuqa_ below reflects POc _&ast;baban_ ‘flat object or surface; board, plank, canoe strake’ ([vol.1:58](ContributionTable?anchor=p-58#cldf:1-3), 185).[^25]

<a id="s-5-3"></a>

### 5.3. Shoulder


POc _&ast;[qa]paRa-_ ‘shoulder’ has usually been reconstructed as a straightforward trisyllable (i.e. _&ast;qapara_), but well distributed reflexes (Gitua, Nakanai, Halia, Selau, Torau, Mono-Alu, Nduke, Lungga, Gela, Big Nambas) lack initial _&ast;qa-_. The same is true of a number of non-Oceanic reflexes listed in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995). POc _&ast;[qa]paRa-_ is thus one of a small number of trisyllabic body part nouns which consist of a disyllabic root (the most common form of POc roots) and apparently had forms with and without POc _&ast;qa-_. Other forms of this kind are POc _&ast;[qa]liŋa-_ ‘voice’, POc _&ast;[qa]liqoR_ ‘neck, throat’ (both [§3.4.14](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-14#cldf:5-3)) and POc _&ast;[qa]nunu_ ‘shadow of person, likeness, reflection’ ([§3.9.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-9-1#cldf:5-3)). Whilst we can describe this pattern, we do not know its function or why alternants apparently survived side by side over a long period.[^26]

As noted in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3) some Oceanic languages refer to the shoulder as the ‘head/knob of arm’, but we cannot say how old this expression is.

[POc &ast;_bʷae-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-4-144-POc-bae-a)

POc _&ast;qapi-ŋa_ ‘armpit’ was a nominalisation (_&ast;-ŋa_) of POc _&ast;qapi(n)_, _&ast;qapin-i-_ ‘hold or carry under the arm’ ([§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-3).10).

### 5.5. Chest


POc _&ast;[Ruma]Ruma-_ ‘chest’ is perhaps derived from POc _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘house’ ([vol.1:48](ContributionTable?anchor=p-48#cldf:1-3)). If a Lapita house is viewed as underlyingly a rough-hewn wooden framework (see the illustration on p53 of vol.1), then the metaphorical extension of ‘house’ to the chest cavity as a whole, bounded by the rib cage and the spine, is visually quite obvious. The same metaphor led to the extension of a reflex of POc _&ast;kaso_ ‘rafters’ to the upper rib cage reflected in PPn _&ast;kaso-kaso_ ([§3.5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-6#cldf:5-3)).

[POc &ast;_&#91;Ruma&#93;Ruma-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-5-145-POc-rumaruma-a)

The term below appears to be a reduplication of the PPn _&ast;fata_ ‘shelf’, but the semantic connection, if any, is not obvious.

[PPn &ast;_fata-fata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-5-145-PPn-fatafata-a)


<a id="s-5-6"></a>

### 5.6. Rib cage


Probably there was no POc word that meant ‘rib’. Instead, POc speakers, like the speakers of a good many Oceanic languages, had a term for ‘rib cage’, and used a composite term meaning ‘bone of rib cage’ or ‘bone of side’ for rib.[^28]

[5-3-5-6-145-adm-nyindrou-druwikabede](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-5-6-145-adm-nyindrou-druwikabede)


<a id="p-146"></a>

As the glosses of some of the terms above imply, at least some Oceanic speakers evidently perceive the rib cage as two ‘sides’ of ribs (such that a rib is a ‘bone of side’). Thus Dami _siri-_ above reflects POc _&ast;siriŋ_ ‘side’ ([vol.2:246](ContributionTable?anchor=p-246#cldf:2-8)). The best candidate for reconstruction with the meaning ‘side of ribs’ is POc _&ast;kabe-_ ‘(lower?) rib cage, side’. Whether this also meant ‘side’ in a generalised locative sense is not clear.

[POc &ast;_kabe-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-6-146-POc-kabe-a)

However, POc _&ast;kabe-_ is apparently not reflected in Eastern Oceanic languages. Here, certain more localised reconstructions are possible. If Bola _karo-_ ‘ribs, side’ is cognate with PSES _&ast;[garo]garo-_ ‘ribs, side’ below, then POc _&ast;garo-_ can be reconstructed, but the available evidence is not strong. The Maringe term is probably borrowed from a SES source.

[PSES &ast;_&#91;garo&#93;garo-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-6-146-PSES-garogaro-a)

There is a small set of terms in NGOc languages that displays formal similarities to the set above, but it is unlikely that the two sets are cognate.

[5-3-5-6-146-nng-lukeppono-girigira](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-5-6-146-nng-lukeppono-girigira)

Some languages distinguish between the (upper, shorter) ribs of the chest (Arosi _rakerake-toʔo_, Wayan Fijian _-saro_) and the (lower, longer) ribs at the side and bottom of the rib cage (Arosi _garogaro-_, Wayan Fijian _-sakesake_), and this distinction may have been present in POc. In the Arosi term _rakerake-toʔo_ ‘upper rib cage’, _toʔo_ means ‘true’. That is, one side of the upper rib cage is the ‘true _rakerake_’, whilst _rakerake-_ alone is the whole side of ribs. The implication here is that _&ast;[rage]rage-_ denoted a side of the upper rib cage, but was also used to mean a whole side of the rib cage. However, this supposition requires confirmation with more data.

[POc &ast;_&#91;rage&#93;rage-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-6-147-POc-ragerage-a)

Two PPn terms are reconstructable, namely _&ast;kaso-kaso_ ‘ribs, upper side’ and _&ast;kao-kao_ ‘ribs, flank, side (of a canoe), upper side of person’. Despite their formal similarity, the evidence indicates two unrelated terms with very similar meanings. PPn _&ast;kaso-kaso_ is almost certainly derived from POc _&ast;kaso_ ‘rafter’ ([vol.1:53](ContributionTable?anchor=p-53#cldf:1-3)). If Mwotlap (NCV) _na-ɣaɣah_ ‘ribs’ is cognate, then the term is of PROc antiquity.

### 5.7. Breast


POc _&ast;susu-_ was polysemous, its meaning commonly extending to ‘milk’. The root _&ast;susu_ evidently also formed a verb ‘suck (at the breast)’ (see [§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-3).3), but _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast’ was formally distinct from it as it was a directly possessed noun, i.e. it took a possessor suffix.

### 5.8. Nipple


‘Nipple’ was denoted by a phrase that combined the terms for ‘eye’ and ‘breast’ with a linking particle. Daughter languages display a variety of linkers, but in POc the linker was probably _&ast;qi_, as this was used with a directly possessed possessum ([§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3)).

<a id="s-5-9"></a>

### 5.9. Belly


PAn _&ast;tiaN_, ancestral to POc _&ast;tia-_ ‘belly’, also provided the base for POc _&ast;tian-an_ ‘pregnant’, discussed in [§4.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-2#cldf:5-3).3. This suggests that POc _&ast;tia-_ referred principally to the external shape of the belly. Terms for the corresponding internal organ, the stomach, are presented in [§3.7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-4#cldf:5-3).

In the comparative literature reflexes of POc _&ast;tia-_ are sometimes confused with those of POc _&ast;taqe-_ ‘faeces’ or POc _&ast;tinaqe-_ ‘intestines’, but slight formal resemblance between _&ast;tia-_ and the two latter terms is due to chance.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;kapʷa_ are the most widespread terms for ‘belly’ in NNG, but there is evidence from one SE Solomonic language that the term is of POc antiquity.

### 5.10. Navel, umbilical cord


Four reconstructions for ‘navel, umbilical cord’, apparently formally related, are candidates for POc status: _&ast;puso-_, _&ast;piso-_, _&ast;bʷito-_, _&ast;buto-_. Although reasons for this proliferation of forms are far from clear, we suggest that there were two POc forms, _&ast;puso-_ (from PMP _&ast;pusej_) ([§3.5.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-10#cldf:5-3).1) and _&ast;bʷito-_ ([§3.5.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-10#cldf:5-3).2), and that forms reflecting apparent _&ast;&ast;piso-_ and _&ast;&ast;buto-_[^29] are descended from _&ast;puso-_ and _&ast;bʷito-_ respectively. They are accounted for as follows:

A) Because POc _&ast;puso-_ and POc _&ast;bʷito-_ were similar in form and meaning, contamination
   affected the vowel of the first syllable, so items reflecting apparent _&ast;&ast;piso-_
   actually reflect _&ast;puso-_ but with the vowel from _&ast;bʷito-_.[^30]
B) The direct evidence for _&ast;bʷ-_ of POc _&ast;bʷito-_ is Drehet _pʷitie_, Tamambo _bʷito-_.
   However, _bʷ_ was an unstable phoneme. In some languages rounding was lost and
   _&ast;bʷito-_ became _&ast;bito-_; in others rounding spread to the following vowel, giving
   forms that seem to reflect _&ast;&ast;buto-_.

To maintain clarity in the face of the complications here, each of the two reconstructions is assigned its own subsection, and have listed forms that appear to reflect _&ast;&ast;piso-_ and _&ast;&ast;buto-_ separately from _&ast;puso-_ and _&ast;bʷito-_. A third subsection handles _&ast;&ast;(b,bʷ)iso-_ and _&ast;&ast;buso-_, displaying a conflation that cannot be assigned unambiguously to either of the reconstructed POc forms.

### 5.12. Buttocks


The reconstruction of a POc term for ‘buttocks’ encounters difficulties similar to those discussed in association with the reconstruction of terms for ‘navel’ ([§3.5.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-10#cldf:5-3)). Three POc forms are supported: _&ast;bʷisi-_, _&ast;(b,bʷ)oto-_ and &ast;buru ‘buttocks’. The reconstructed forms begin with a labial or labiovelar and have medial _&ast;-s-_, _&ast;-t-_ or _&ast;-r-_. Unfortunately the data are insufficient to tell a story that would unite any of the cognate sets below, but it is perhaps no coincidence that POc _&ast;bʷisi-_ ‘buttocks, anus’ was identical in form to POc _&ast;bʷisi_ ‘fart’ ([§4.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-7#cldf:5-3).3).

#### 5.13.1. Penis


POc _&ast;quti-_ ‘penis’ continues a PAn etymon, and is widely reflected in Oceanic. However, it is not reflected in Micronesian or Polynesian languages and has been replaced throughout Polynesia and parts of Micronesia by reflexes of PROc _&ast;ule-_ ‘penis’.

[POc &ast;_lasoR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-13-158-POc-lasor-a)

<a id="s-5-13-3"></a>

#### 5.13.3. Female genitalia


POc _&ast;puki-_ ‘vagina’ and PPn _&ast;tole-_ ‘female genitalia’ can each be derived from a PMP term, but in the case of _&ast;tole-_ only if some phonological deformation is allowed in the derivation, perhaps as a result of euphemism.

[PAn &ast;_puki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-13-158-POc-puki-a)


<a id="p-159"></a>

Such deformation seems to underlie the three PMP forms reconstructed by Blust (ACD). If PPn _&ast;tole_ is indeed cognate with one of these, then it reflects yet another variant, PMP †_&ast;telay_.

[PMP &ast;_teli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-13-159-POc-tole-a)

POc (?) _&ast;keRe-_ is not well attested, and may be due to chance resemblance.

[POc &ast;_keRe-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-5-13-159-POc-kere-a)

In Central Pacific languages a reflex of POc _&ast;buku-_ ‘mound, knob, joint’ ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.2; [vol.1:85](ContributionTable?anchor=p-85#cldf:1-4), [vol.2:50](ContributionTable?anchor=p-50#cldf:2-3)) is used to refer to the genital area (probably a metonym based on the mons veneris).

## 6. Limbs


Terms relating to the limbs are ordered as follows. First come terms associated with the arms and hands, then terms associated with the legs and feet, and finally terms associated with both pairs of limbs (finger/toe, finger-/toenail, elbow/knee and palm/sole).


<a id="p-160"></a>


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Hand, arm


The monomorphemic POc terms listed below evidently referred to the hand and arm as one unit, although some languages limit their reflex to the hand and lower arm (e.g. Iduna (PT) _fowa-na nima-_ [scrotum-its arm-] ‘muscle of lower arm’), and POc _&ast;[l,n]ima-_ may well have had the more specific POc sense ‘forearm and hand’ as well as the larger sense ‘arm and hand’. Monomorphemic terms for parts of the arm are much harder to find, but terms for ‘upper arm’ and ‘hand’ are reconstructed in [§3.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-2#cldf:5-3).

Reflexes of POc _&ast;lima_ and _&ast;nima_ ‘hand’ are numerous throughout the Austronesian world, most referring at the same time to ‘five’.

Reflexes of the Meso-Melanesian and Eastern Oceanic subgroups largely support _&ast;l-_, while those from the Admiralties support _&ast;n-_. The NNG and PT subgroups show no clear pattern. Either _&ast;l-_ was sometimes nasalised to _n-_ before a nasal-initial syllable, or both forms existed as doublets in POc.

[PAn &ast;_&#91;qa&#93;lima_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-1-160-POc-lima-a)


<a id="p-161"></a>

A second form, POc _&ast;paRa_ ‘hand, arm’ is reconstructable, based on non-Oceanic cognates together with cognates from Central Vanuatu. Blust (ACD) writes that it is possible that these forms should be assigned to PMP _&ast;[qa]baRa_ ‘shoulder’ with parallel semantic shifts that create the illusion of an independent comparison, but he regards this hypothesis as unlikely. We agree with him, as there are a number of reflexes of POc _&ast;[qa]paRa_ ‘shoulder’ which lack the first syllable, and all consistently denote ‘shoulder’. The gloss ‘arm, hand’ here suggests that PMP _&ast;baRa_/POc _&ast;paRa_ was a distinct if nearly homophonous etymon.

It is possible that PMP _&ast;paRada_/POc _&ast;paRara_ ‘handle of an axe or adze’ has played some role in the history of this form. Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic reflexes are trisyllabic, but [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs PNCV _&ast;vara_ ‘handle’. The disyllabic form may be the result of contamination by _&ast;vara_ ‘hand, arm’, and may in turn have led to the preservation of the latter. But this is a speculation.

[PMP &ast;_baRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-1-161-POc-para-a)


<a id="p-162"></a>

The use of reflexes of POc _&ast;banic_ and _&ast;kaba-_ for ‘arm’ in some daughter languages is an extension of their core meaning ‘wing’ ([vol.4:132](ContributionTable?anchor=p-132#cldf:4-2)–133, 275). We add ‘arm, hand’ to the glosses of ‘wing’ reconstructions with a question mark, as it is possible that extensions of meaning to ‘arm’ have occurred independently in daughter languages.

### 6.2. Parts of the arm


Terms for the elbow, the fingers and fingernails and the palm of the hand are discussed in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3) together with the corresponding parts of the leg.

Oceanic languages typically distinguish terminologically between the upper arm (from shoulder to elbow), the forearm (from elbow to wrist), the wrist, and the hand, but the terms referring to them are often compounds or phrases. There is some evidence, however, that POc &ast;nima/lima denoted in its more specific sense the forearm and hand, whilst early Oceanic speakers also had single-word terms for the upper arm and for the hand.

<a id="s-6-3"></a>

### 6.3. Left hand and right hand


The three POc terms for ‘left-hand’, _&ast;kauRi_, _&ast;mawiRi_ and _&ast;mauRi_, reflect a single PAn/PMP root _&ast;wiRi_ ‘left’. POc _&ast;kauRi_ reflects PMP _&ast;ka-wiRi_, where _&ast;ka-_ formed a stative verb (‘be on the left’). PMP _&ast;ma-wiRi_ was the actor voice form of this verb, and is reflected in POc _&ast;mawiRi_ and its variant _&ast;mauRi_. The POc forms _&ast;mawiRi_ and _&ast;mauRi_ are reconstructed separately below, but it is quite likely that at least some of the forms listed under _&ast;mauRi_ are descended from _&ast;mawiRi_, the sound change _&ast;-wi-_ to _&ast;-u-_ having occurred independently in various languages.

The pairs _&ast;kawanan_/_&ast;mawanan_ ‘right’ and _&ast;kataqu_/_&ast;mataqu_, also ‘right’, below, have similar origins, but here the unaffixed roots _&ast;wanan_ and _&ast;taqu_ evidently also survived into POc (Evans 2001:343).

It is probable that at least the terms in _&ast;ma-_ were also used as verbs in POc. Grammatical information about their reflexes is hard to find, but [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)) glosses To’aba’ita (SES) _mauli_ as an intransitive verb ‘be on the left’, which is also used attributively (e.g. _maa mauli nau_ [eye be.on.left I] ‘my left eye’). The attributive use of stative verbs is normal in Oceanic languages ([Ross 1998c](Source#cldf:Ross1998c)). However, there is evidence that these terms also functioned as nouns in phrasal constructions, as in Kwaio (SES) _gula i mooli_ [side LINKER left] ‘lefthand side’ and Wayan Fijian _lima i matau_ [hand LINKER right] ‘right hand’. Both phrasal expressions reflect the POc nonspecific possessor construction where the item after _&ast;qi_ was a noun ([§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3)). For example, the Wayan example reflects POc _&ast;lima qi mataqu_, lit. ‘hand on/ of/at right’.

Note that in the glosses below, hyphenated ‘left-hand’ and ‘right-hand’ indicate that the term appears to be an adjective or a stative verb.

### 6.4. Leg, foot


Proto Oceanic speakers evidently used a single term for the leg and foot.

Blust (ACD) reconstructs both PAn _&ast;qaqay_ and PAn _&ast;waqay_, and the two forms are both continued in Oceanic. POc _&ast;waqe-_ is reflected in Fijian and Polynesian and _&ast;qaqe-_ in Admiralties, Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic languages. There are no reflexes in Micronesia or Vanuatu. No language has reflexes of both forms.

Terms meaning both ‘knee’ and ‘elbow’ are presented in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1. Other terms, presented here, appear originally to have meant ‘knee’, but are in some languages also applied to ‘elbow’.

More than one POc term beginning with _&ast;tu-_ is reconstructable with the meaning ‘knee’. Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _&ast;tur_. POc _&ast;turu-_ is also attested. PWOc _&ast;tuku-_ is reasonably well attested. A number of NW Solomonic languages reflect _&ast;tuŋu-_ (Banoni, Piva _cuŋu-_ ‘knee’, Lungga, Nduke _tu-tuŋu_ ‘knee, elbow’, Vangunu, Roviana _tuŋu-tuŋu_ ‘knee, elbow’).

The relationships among these forms are only partially understood. The histories of PWOc _&ast;tuku-_ and NW Solomonic _&ast;tuŋu-_ are not known, but we can show how POc _&ast;tur_ and _&ast;turu-_ are related.

The PAn form for ‘knee’ was _&ast;tuduS_ (ACD). PAn _&ast;S_ became PMP _&ast;h_, and a regular metathesis whereby PAn &ast;-CV_S_ became PMP &ast;-_h_VC gave rise to PMP _&ast;tuhud_ ‘knee’. By regular sound change this became POc _&ast;tur_ (ACD), reflexes of which are shown below. Some of these reflexes are reduplicated as a means of creating the preferred canonic form, a disyllable, from monosyllabic _&ast;tur_. The preferred strategy for creating a (suffixed) directly possessed noun ([§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3)) from a root with a final consonant was to replace the final consonant with the suffix, as many reconstructions in this chapter illustrate, but in the case of monosyllabic _&ast;tur_, a supporting vowel was added instead, giving disyllabic _&ast;turu-_, a change which seems to have occurred at an earlier interstage than POc as Blust (ACD) reconstructs _&ast;turu-_ to PCEMP.[^35]

#### 6.5.3. Calf and shin


The calf is referred to by a compound meaning ‘liver of leg’ in widespread languages.

[POc &ast;_qate qi &#91;q,w&#93;aqay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-5-171-POc-qateqiqwaqay-a)

Western Oceanic languages have a set of semantically related compounds for the calf. In some languages the calf is ‘scrotum of leg’ or ‘testicle of leg’. In others ‘nut of leg’ is found, noting that ‘nut’, ‘seed’ and ‘testicle’ are often glosses of the same term in Oceanic languages. In a number of Papuan Tip languages it is ‘roe of leg’, where the term for ‘roe’ reflects POc _&ast;biRa-_ ([vol.4:129](ContributionTable?anchor=p-129#cldf:4-2)).

[5-3-6-5-171-nng-takia-ielaben](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-6-5-171-nng-takia-ielaben)

Languages from Papuan Tip and Polynesia use the metaphor of a ridge to refer to the shin bone, albeit in non-cognate terms.

#### 6.5.4. Heel


Blust reconstructs PMP _&ast;tiked_ ‘heel’ (ACD), but no Oceanic reflexes have been found. Instead there are compounds. In NW Melanesia, the usual expression appears to be ‘occiput of foot’, using a reflex of POc _&ast;k(i,e)ju-_/PNGOc _&ast;g(i,e)ju-_ ‘back of head, occiput’ ([§3.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-5#cldf:5-3)). Of the reflexes below, only Nakanai _kisu_ and Ubir _etu-_ are independently attested in the data with the back of the head as denotatum, but there is little doubt that all the items listed are reflexes thereof. In Tawala the reduplicated form, encoding ‘little occiput’, lacks a reflex of _&ast;g(i,e)ju-_, probably once present as it is in closely related Gumawana.

[POc &ast;_k(i,e)ju (qi) qaqe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-5-172-POc-kiejuqiqaqe-a)

Takia speakers use the semantically corresponding expression _ŋie- buro-n_ [leg-X occiput-its].

In at least some Oceanic languages the corresponding expression is ‘back of foot’, using the relational local noun POc _&ast;muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after; (canoe) stern; space outside’ ([vol.2:251](ContributionTable?anchor=p-251#cldf:2-8)) or its variant _&ast;buri-_ ([vol.2:253](ContributionTable?anchor=p-253#cldf:2-8)).

<a id="s-6-6"></a>

### 6.6. Footprint


The addition of _&ast;-kV_ to the Nyindrou, Manam and Mota reflexes of POc _&ast;mʷale-_ ‘footprint’ is unexplained, but the addition of _-ŋ(V)_ in the Neve’ei and Tape reflexes implies that _&ast;mʷale-_ was at some point a verb, to which nominalising _&ast;-ŋa_ was then added.

[POc &ast;_mʷale-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-6-172-POc-male-a)

In a number of WOc languages the term for footprint is ‘back of leg’, or more logically ‘after foot’, with a reflex of _&ast;muri-_ or _&ast;buri-_ ‘back, be after’ ([vol.2:311](ContributionTable?anchor=p-311#cldf:2-9)-312). Note that this compound means ‘heel’ in some Oceanic languages ([§3.6.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-5#cldf:5-3)).

[5-3-6-6-173-nng-mutu-axemuri](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-6-6-173-nng-mutu-axemuri)

### 6.7. Groin, crotch


The POc term for the crotch was _&ast;saŋa-_, which was also used for a forked stick or branch.

### 6.8. Parts common to arm/hand and leg/foot


Note that ‘armpit’ is treated as part of the trunk ([§3.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-4#cldf:5-3)).


<a id="s-6-8-1"></a>

#### 6.8.1. Elbow and knee


This section has two parts to facilitate crossreferencing, particularly between the formally similar pairs of terms in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3) and [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1.

POc also had terms that specifically denoted the knee. For these, see [§3.6.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-5#cldf:5-3).2.


<a id="p-174"></a>


##### 6.8.1.1. POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee, joint’


The formal aspects of the two terms reconstructed here are discussed at length in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3).

POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ was evidently the general term for a knee or elbow joint, but not hip or shoulder. The seemingly optional _&ast;-ka-_ that is reflected in some members of the cognate set remains unexplained,[^39] unless, as mentioned in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3), _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ originally meant ‘kneecap’ and is identical with putative _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’.

[POc &ast;_pʷatu&#91;ka&#93;-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-8-174-POc-patuka-a)

Whether and how PSOc _&ast;bʷau-_ ‘knee, joint’ is related to POc _&ast;pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ is not known. See the discussion in [§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-3).

<a id="p-175"></a>


##### 6.8.1.2. Other terms for joint, elbow and knee


Reflexes of POc _&ast;buku_ ‘mound, knob, joint’ are also used in a number of Oceanic languages to refer to the elbow and/or knee. However, it is clear that _&ast;buku_ focussed on the shape of the referent,[^41] whereas the central meaning of the terms reconstructed in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).1.1 was the knee or elbow joint itself.

As elbows are more corner-like than knees, POc _&ast;s[i,u]ku_, reflecting a PMP term that also meant ‘corner’, may have referred specifically to ‘elbow’.

#### 6.8.2. Fingers and toes, finger- and toenails


Where data are from dictionaries rather than from wordlists, it is clear that the same term is typically used in Oceanic languages for ‘fingernail’, ‘toenail’ and ‘claw (of quadruped or bird)’, and this was presumably the case in POc too. However, wordlist sources tend to show a term only for ‘fingernail’.

POc _&ast;kuku-_ apparently also denoted ‘finger’. Both non-Oceanic (ACD) and Oceanic reflexes attest to this.

[PMP &ast;_kuSkuS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-8-176-POc-kuku-a)

<a id="p-178"></a>

The index finger (forefinger) in many Oceanic languages is denoted by a form that is identical with or includes the verb ‘point’. Indeed, _&ast;tusu-_ ‘forefinger’ is derived from a PMP term meaning ‘point’. In the Papuan Tip area forefinger terms sometimes allude to the fact that one dips the forefinger into food in order to taste it: Dawawa _buta-remo_ (_buta_ ‘salt’, _remo_ ‘taste’), Tawala _habaya-lemu_ (_habaya_ ‘cooking pot’, _lemu_ ‘taste’). Terms for the other digits are not reconstructable, but the thumb is ‘big digit’ in a number of languages: Misima _gig-bʷaya_ (_gigi_ ‘finger, toe’, _bʷaya_ ‘big’), PNCV _&ast;bisu-laba_ (_&ast;bisu_ ‘finger’, _&ast;laba_ ‘big’; [Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)), Wayan _kuku-levu_ (_levu_ ‘big’).

<a id="s-6-8-3"></a>

#### 6.8.3. Palm of hand and sole of foot


PMP _&ast;palaj_ ‘palm of hand, sole of foot’ is widely reflected in western Malayo-Polynesian languages, but only a single Oceanic reflex occurs in the data. Most Oceanic languages support POc _&ast;lapʷar_.

[PMP &ast;_palaj_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-8-178-POc-palaj-a)


<a id="p-179"></a>

POc _&ast;lapʷar_ ‘palm of hand, sole of foot’ appears superficially to reflect PAn _&ast;da(m)paN_ ‘palm of hand, sole of foot’,[^42] but the latter would give rise to POc †_&ast;ra(p,b)an_, so this is probably a chance resemblance.

[POc &ast;_lapʷar_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-6-8-179-POc-lapar-a)

Neither of these reconstructions has reflexes in Eastern Oceanic. The most common term in Eastern Oceanic, found also in the Admiralties, is a compound meaning ‘face of hand/foot’, containing a reflex of POc _&ast;qarop_ ‘front, face’ ([vol.2:247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8)) plus the term for hand or foot, contrasting with ‘back of hand/foot’ for the back of the hand and top of the foot ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).4).

<a id="s-6-8-4"></a>

#### 6.8.4. Back of hand and top of foot


The top of the foot was apparently the ‘back of foot’ in POc, as it is in geographically distant modern languages. This seems odd in European thinking, until it is recognised that Oceanic speakers view feet and hands analogously: the palm of the hand and sole of the foot are perceived as ‘face, front’ ([§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-3).3), the back of the hand and top of the foot as ‘back’.

[5-3-6-8-180-nng-hote-dumsae](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-6-8-180-nng-hote-dumsae)

Note that this term was distinct from POc _&ast;[m,b]uri (w,q)aqe_ ‘heel’ ([§3.6.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-5#cldf:5-3).2) (lit. ‘back of foot’). POc _&ast;[m,b]uri_ was a relational local noun denoting the back of something ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3)), but the terms for ‘back’ in ‘top of foot’ phrases denote a person’s back.

## 7. Internal organs



<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. Internal organs in general


The internal organs are listed here roughly in order from the top of the trunk to the bottom. There is a certain amount of evidence that POc _&ast;qate-_ ‘liver’, regarded as the seat of the emotions and the centre of one’s being ([§3.7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-6#cldf:5-3)), also served as a collective term for the internal organs. This is clear in terms from Nakanai (MM), where the liver itself is specified by adding a modifier (_kuru_) to the more general term _hate-_, reflecting POc _&ast;qate-_.

[5-3-7-1-180-mm-nakanai-hate](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-7-1-180-mm-nakanai-hate)

The terms below reveal a similar pattern: the reflex of _&ast;qate-_ denotes the internal organs, and various modifiers indicate the specific organ (see also the terms for ‘lungs’ in [§3.7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-3#cldf:5-3)).

### 7.2. Heart


Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _&ast;buaq_ ‘areca nut and palm; heart’. The only reflex listed in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) with the meaning ‘heart’ is Tolai _buai-_, which is in fact a reflex of PWOc _&ast;busa(q)_ ‘heart’, as _-s-_ is lost in Tolai. However, Vitu, Bola and Nakanai have _bua-_ ‘heart’, and these are regular reflexes of POc _&ast;buaq_, not of _&ast;busa(q)_.

[PMP &ast;_buaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-2-181-POc-buaq-a)

The two reconstructions below, POc _&ast;pu(s,c)o_ ‘heart’ and PWOc _&ast;busa(q)_ ‘heart’ are similar in form (and _&ast;busa(q)_ is similar to _&ast;buaq_ above), and there is no semantic difference between them. The reflexes of both mean ‘heart’ with an occasional instance of ‘liver’. This is presumably an outcome of the fact that both the heart and the liver are regarded as seats of the emotions by speakers of various Oceanic languages. Where similar forms occur with similar meanings, there may be contamination of one by the other, and Wogeo _buso-_ and Malai _pus-pusa-_ both seem to illustrate this.

No convincing explanation can be offered for the fact that there are two terms, but note (i) that POc _&ast;puso-_ is also one of the forms reconstructed for ‘navel’ ([§3.5.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-10#cldf:5-3)) and (ii) that POc _&ast;puco(q)_[^44] and POc _&ast;busa_ are both terms for ‘foam’ ([vol.2:96](ContributionTable?anchor=p-96#cldf:2-4)–97) and that each has a PMP antecedent. Whilst it is easier to explain (i) as a semantic shift, it is more difficult to explain away (ii), the fact that the same two forms occur for both ‘foam’ and ‘heart’. One of the reconstructed terms for ‘lungs’ ([§3.7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-3#cldf:5-3)) includes a word meaning ‘foam’ and, as the heart and lungs are in close relationship anatomically, it may be that an early meaning shift has occurred here.

### 7.3. Lungs


Three reconstructions for ‘lungs’ are offered below. The first of these is technically unusual in that two possible pre-Oceanic source etyma can be posited, PAn _&ast;baRaq_ ‘lung’ and PMP _&ast;para_ ‘coconut embryo’, and therefore two alternative POc forms, _&ast;paRa(q)_ ‘lung’ and _&ast;paraq_ ‘spongy mass…’. At first sight it seems obvious to propose that PAn _&ast;baRaq_ ‘lung’ is ancestral to this cognate set below. However, the Micronesian reflexes listed below are interpreted by [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) as containing a reflex PMic _&ast;fara_ ‘core (of breadfruit, coconut, pandanus)’, which reflects POc _&ast;paraq_ ‘spongy mass inside sprouting coconut; brain’ ([vol.3:373](ContributionTable?anchor=p-373#cldf:3-12)). The Micronesian reflexes other than Marshallese have an additional element, and it is reasonable to infer that this reflects POc _&ast;uRat_/PMic _&ast;ua_ ‘veins, arteries, tendons’, reflecting a possible (but not firmly reconstructable) POc _&ast;paraq qi uRat_, meaning approximately ‘spongy mass of innards’, i.e. ‘lungs’. This does not mean that PAn _&ast;baRaq_ ‘lung’ has played no role in the derivation of Oceanic forms, but that at least in a number of early Oceanic languages POc _&ast;paRa(q)_ and _&ast;paraq_ were conflated.[^45]

[PAn &ast;_baRaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-3-182-POc-paraq-a)


<a id="p-183"></a>

Reflexes of PAn _&ast;baRaq_/PMP _&ast;para_ are found only in languages of Vanuatu and Micronesia. Its place has often been taken elsewhere in Oceanic by compound expressions. Two of these can be reconstructed to POc, both compounds including reflexes of _&ast;qate-_ ‘liver’ ([§3.7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-6#cldf:5-3)), which was apparently also used collectively to denote the major organs. The literal meaning of the first compound was ‘frothy liver’. Its second element was a reduplicated version of _&ast;busaq_ or _&ast;puco(q)_ ‘froth, foam’ (cf [§3.7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-2#cldf:5-3), and see footnote 44, p181). The reduplication formed an adjective ([vol.2:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:2-7)) ‘frothy’, referring to the appearance of the lungs when an animal is butchered. In several of the languages in the next set, the second element on its own has come to refer to ‘lungs’.

[POc &ast;_qate busa-busaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-3-183-POc-qatebusabusaq-a)

The following items are variations on the same semantic theme:

[5-3-7-3-183-nng-bukawa-ategasop](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-7-3-183-nng-bukawa-ategasop)

The second element of the second compound reflects _&ast;maRaqa(n)_ ‘light of weight’, referring to the apparent lightness of the sponge-like material which makes up the lungs.

Araki (NCV) uses a similar, albeit non-cognate, metaphor, _mavusa salesale_, literally ‘innards/ heart light in weight’ to refer to lungs.

### 7.4. Stomach


POc speakers probably made a terminological distinction between the stomach, i.e. the internal organ that they found when they butchered a pig, and the belly, i.e. a part of the body as viewed from outside. Terms for stomach are presented here, and terms for belly in [§3.5.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-9#cldf:5-3).

POc _&ast;tobʷa_ has reflexes meaning ‘stomach’ across all major subgroups other than NNG, MM and Pn. In some languages it also refers to a bag or basket, and this appears to have been its primary meaning,[^46] allowing derivation of the senses ‘bay’ and ‘area of sea enclosed by barrier reef’ (landscape features that depend on some other feature of the ‘bag’ metaphor; [vol.2:46](ContributionTable?anchor=p-46#cldf:2-3)) and ‘stomach’, which appears bag-like when an animal is butchered. Reflexes with all these meanings are listed below. The Malakula reflexes under ‘cf. also’ point to a form _&ast;tobʷa(k,q)a-_, but we do not yet understand whether such reflexes are conservative or innovatory.

PCP _&ast;kete_ ‘abdomen’ evidently reflects the same metaphor applied to a different form, as it reflects PROc _&ast;kete_ ‘basket’ ([vol.1:78](ContributionTable?anchor=p-78#cldf:1-4)).

[PCP &ast;_kete_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-4-185-PCP-kete-a)

POc _&ast;bʷal(o,a)-_ is the most widely reflected term for ‘belly’ in MM and NCV, but in many languages its reflex is used as a relational local noun, ‘inside’ ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3) and [vol.2:239](ContributionTable?anchor=p-239#cldf:2-8)), implying that its main referent was the internal organ. This interpretation is supported by the fact that it sometimes appeared as the first element in compounds referring to ‘intestines’. In South New Ireland languages it is also used in what was perhaps originally a colloquial term ‘carry stomach’ for ‘be pregnant, carry a child’.

[POc &ast;_bʷal(o,a)-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-4-185-POc-baloa-a)


<a id="p-186"></a>

The principal PPn term for the stomach was _&ast;manawa_ ‘belly, stomach’, reflecting POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ (V) ‘breathe, rest, be alive’; (N) ‘breath, life, fontanelle’. The history of terms descended from POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ is complex and is discussed with a fuller set of reflexes in [§4.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-1#cldf:5-3). We speculate that the semantic shift that gave rise to the meaning ‘belly, stomach’ may have first followed a path suggested by Blust (ACD): ‘…from the notion “breath; to breathe” there is a link to the “breath soul”, and from this to “soul; inner self, mind, feelings”…’. As the stomach is regarded as the seat of the emotions in some Oceanic cultures, it is only a short step from here to ‘stomach’. Nonetheless, the evidence amassed in ch.9 indicates that _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ did not occur in POc body-part metaphors denoting emotions, and that the changes that led to the meaning ‘belly, stomach’ occurred long after the break-up of POc. Three non-Polynesian reflexes with a meaning relating to the stomach are listed under ‘cf. also’. We take the Kiribati term to reflect Polynesian influence and the Papuan Tip terms to reflect a localised innovation that happens to be similar to Polynesian.

[PAn &ast;_LiSawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-4-186-POc-manawa-a)


<a id="p-187"></a>

A similar semantic shift apparently derived PPn _&ast;qalo_ ‘belly’ from PCP _&ast;qalo_ ‘soul’. Note that this etymon is distinct from POc _&ast;qarop_ ‘face, front’ ([§3.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-7#cldf:5-3)).

### 7.5. Intestines


A number of reflexes of the terms reconstructed for belly or stomach in [§3.7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-4#cldf:5-3) are glossed ‘intestines’ or ‘guts’. In some instances it is obvious that the term so glossed is a compound that includes a word for belly or stomach, but others may be the result of inadequate data collection. The same is true of terms in this section. It is not easy to identify the internal organs unless one has a butchered animal to refer to.

The most widely reflected POc etymon for intestines is _&ast;tinaqe_, derived from a PAn nominalisation formed by infixing _&ast;⟨in⟩_ into PAn _&ast;Caqi_ ‘faeces’.[^48] Its reflexes have become relational local nouns in a few languages ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-3) and [vol.2:239](ContributionTable?anchor=p-239#cldf:2-8)).

[PAn &ast;_Cinaqi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-5-187-POc-tinaqe-a)


<a id="p-188"></a>

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PWMP _&ast;isaw_ and suggests that it may have referred exclusively to animal intestines. The Oceanic evidence suggests a more general gloss ‘innards, guts’ for POc _&ast;iso-_. Some of its Polynesian reflexes include the senses ‘umbilical cord’ and ‘pith’, suggesting semantic contamination by the formally somewhat similar _&ast;puso-_ ‘navel, umbilical cord’ ([§3.5.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-10#cldf:5-3).1) and/or POc _&ast;quto-_ ‘brain, pith, marrow’ ([vol.3:374](ContributionTable?anchor=p-374#cldf:3-12)–375).

### 7.6. Liver


The liver was evidently regarded by Proto Oceanic speakers as the centre of one’s being, the place in which feelings, emotions, desires, understanding, and knowledge were located (see the discussion in [§9.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-2-1#cldf:5-3) of terms for emotions that refer to the liver). In terms of physical body parts, although POc &ast;qate evidently refers primarily to ‘liver’, its meaning is frequently broadened in daughter languages to include other internal organs: ‘heart’, ‘chest’ and, less commonly, ‘lungs’ and ‘spleen’ ([§3.7.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-1#cldf:5-3)).

### 7.7. Gall bladder


Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _&ast;qasu_ ‘gall bladder’, but notes that it almost certainly does not reflect PAn _&ast;qapeju_ ‘gall, gall bladder’.[^49] Its reconstruction here as _&ast;qasun_ with final _&ast;-n_ (reflected in Lukep and Nehan) confirms that he is correct.

<a id="p-192"></a>


<a id="s-7-8"></a>

### 7.8. Spleen


The spleen is a significant organ in many Oceanic communities because malaria may lead to its enlargement, leading on occasion to its fatal rupture. Some languages have a word with a meaning relating to an enlarged spleen, e.g. Titan (Adm) map ‘condition of having an enlarged spleen’ (N), Iduna (PT) _kʷada_ ‘enlarged spleen’, Gela (SES) _bila_ ‘enlarged spleen’.

Although not widely attested in the data, there is sufficient representation across subgroups to attribute _&ast;bila-_ ‘spleen’ to POc.

[POc &ast;_bila-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-8-192-POc-bila-a)

Two metaphoric expressions for ‘spleen’ have been reconstructed for PPn: _&ast;qate-loa_ (‘long liver’) and _&ast;qate-pili_ (‘sticky liver’). Bauan Fijian _yate balavu_ echoes the former, with a non-cognate term for ‘long’.

[PPn &ast;_qate-loa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-8-192-PPn-qateloa-a)


<a id="s-7-9"></a>

### 7.9. Kidney


A term for ‘kidney’ cannot be reconstructed with any certainty. In many Oceanic languages the term for kidney is a metaphor that makes reference to an object that is perceived as kidney- shaped, typically a fruit or nut, or is preceded by a classifier for such objects. For instance, reflexes of POc _&ast;puaq_ ‘fruit’ occur in Adm, SES, NCV and Pn terms.

The most frequent metaphor equates a kidney with a Tahitian chestnut (_Inocarpus fagifer_), and this points to a possible reconstruction. One POc term for the Tahitian chestnut was _&ast;ipi_ ([vol.3:318](ContributionTable?anchor=p-318#cldf:3-11)) and a very few languages reflect this or a reduplicated form _&ast;ip(i)-ipi_ in the sense of kidney.


<a id="p-193"></a>

[POc &ast;_ip(i)-ipi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-9-193-POc-ipiipi-a)

There are also several other terms arising from the same metaphor, reflecting POc _&ast;mabʷe_ ‘Tahitian chestnut’ ([vol.3:319](ContributionTable?anchor=p-319#cldf:3-11)).[^50]

[5-3-7-9-193-ses-arosi-koraimabe](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-7-9-193-ses-arosi-koraimabe)

A Tolai (MM) term is _ela_ ‘chestnut tree; the kidneys’. In this instance it is not clear which was the original meaning.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;giri-giri_ ‘coral, coral rubble’ ([vol.2:64](ContributionTable?anchor=p-64#cldf:2-3)) have in places varied their meaning to ‘pebble’ and thence to pebble-shaped objects like kidneys (Paul Geraghty, pers. comm.). Thus we find:

[5-3-7-9-193-ses-lau-ligiligi](cf.csv#cldf:5-3-7-9-193-ses-lau-ligiligi)

Examples embodying other metaphors for the kidneys based on shape are listed below. Where known the reconstructed POc antecedent of each element is given.

<a id="s-7-10"></a>

### 7.10. Bladder


There is ample evidence for a POc compound meaning ‘bladder’ consisting of a first element that meant something like ‘bag’, ‘basket’ (in several languages a reflex of _&ast;taŋa_ ‘small bag’, [vol.1:79](ContributionTable?anchor=p-79#cldf:1-4)) or similar round container and a second element _mimi[q,s]_ ‘urine’ ([§4.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-7#cldf:5-3)), sometimes joined by a linker POc _&ast;qi_ or _&ast;ni_.

### 7.11. Uterus, placenta and amniotic fluid


No POc term is reconstructable for the uterus, but it is noteworthy that in scattered languages the term for ‘stomach’ is used, sometimes with a qualifier, e.g. ‘stomach of child’.

There is, however, a term for the placenta, POc _&ast;tapuni-_. The loss of _-n-_ or _-ni-_ in a majority of reflexes may reflect reanalysis of _-ni_ as a verbal transitive suffix. Robert Blust (pers. comm.) suggests that the practice of burying the placenta described in the Kwaio gloss prepares the way for the extension of meaning to the transitive verb ‘bury, conceal’ reflected in Arosi, leading to the resultant deletion of transitivising _-ni_ from the noun form.

[PMP &ast;_tambuni_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-11-195-POc-tapuni-a)

PPn _&ast;fanua_, reflecting PMP _&ast;banua_ and POc _&ast;panua_ ‘inhabited area or territory’ ([vol.1:62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:1-3)), referred also to the placenta.

[PPn &ast;_fanua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-7-11-195-PPn-fanua-a)

Terms for amniotic fluid are few and far between in the data sources, but those that occur have to do with ‘water’. Gela _mbeimbeti_ ‘amniotic fluid’ is a reduplicated form of _mbeti_ ‘fresh water’. The only reconstruction for ‘amniotic fluid’ is PPn _&ast;lanu_, which is a reflex of POc _&ast;[dr,r]anum_ ‘fresh water’ and also meant ‘bathe or wash in fresh water’ (POLLEX).

## 8. Bodily emissions


This topic of this section is substances that are emitted by the body (as opposed to those of which the body is composed; [§3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3#cldf:5-3)). They are listed in the same order as the body parts in §[§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:5-3)–3.5 with which their emission is associated, that is, roughly in order from the top of the trunk to the bottom. Verbs associated with bodily emissions are presented in [§4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:5-3).

The POc term for pus is presented in [§5.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-2#cldf:5-3).2 in association with terms that have to do with health and sickness. A multiplicity of terms for the action of spitting and for spittle are included in [§4.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-3#cldf:5-3). They are there rather than here because the terms for saliva/spittle appear to be derived from verbs of spitting. However, a possible compound for ‘saliva’ is mentioned in [§3.8.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-4#cldf:5-3). Similarly the POc term for ‘sweat’ (both verb and noun) was originally a verb (_&ast;ma-qono_) and is also to be found in [§4.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-6#cldf:5-3). Terms for ‘urine’ and ‘urinate’ also employ the same roots and are located in [§4.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-7#cldf:5-3).


<a id="s-8-1"></a>

### 8.1. Tears


Terms for ‘tears’ are typically compounds, as in PEOc _&ast;suRu qi mata_ ‘tears’, literally ‘fluid of eye’ or PROc _&ast;wai(R) ni mata_, literally ‘water of eye’, in which the first item denotes a fluid[^52] and the second reflects POc _&ast;mata_ ‘eye’ ([§3.4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-9#cldf:5-3).1). Because the ‘fluid’ item has been replaced at various times, some members of the cognate sets below may be outcomes of independent replacement. Thus PPn _&ast;lo-qi-mata_ ‘tears’ is well attested, suggesting that Hawaiian _wai maka_ and Marquesan _vai-mata_ may reflect local innovations independent of PROc _&ast;wai(R) ni mata_. (On _&ast;qi_, see [§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-3), [Hooper 1985](Source#cldf:Hooper1985), [Ross 1998c](Source#cldf:Ross1998c).)

The terms below represent somewhat different phrasal strategies for expressing ‘tears’. Bileki _ma-sali_ apparently reflects a stative form of POc _&ast;saliR_ ‘to flow’ ([vol.2:94](ContributionTable?anchor=p-94#cldf:2-4)), where _ma-_ is the stative prefix (_ma-_ does not reflect _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye’).

<a id="s-8-2"></a>

### 8.2. Earwax and deafness


The association between earwax and deafness in the glosses of POc _&ast;tul(i,e)_ below is an obvious one, but the cognate set raises the question, What did POc _&ast;tul(i,e)_ mean? ‘Earwax’ or ‘deaf’ or both?[^53] A key to the answer lies in the fact that ‘he is deaf’ is usually expressed in the Oceanic languages of New Guinea and the Bismarcks as ‘his ears are deaf/blocked/closed’, i.e. by an expression in which ‘ears’ is the subject. In Dobu and Muyuw, at least, reflexes of _&ast;tul(i,e)_ are also the predicate of such a construction, i.e. ‘his ears are earwaxed’. Thus if _&ast;tul(i,e)_ was used as a noun, it meant ‘earwax’ (and perhaps ‘deafness’); if it was used as a verb with ‘ears’ as subject, then it meant ‘be deaf’. In PPn the sense ‘deaf’ was retained and ‘earwax’ became _&ast;taqe-tuli_ ‘excrement of deafness’. Samoan has a compound verb _faʔa-taliŋa-tuli_ ‘turn a deaf ear’ [lit. ‘cause ear deaf’].


<a id="p-198"></a>

Another term for ‘deaf’ was POc _&ast;pʷapo_ ([§5.3.14](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-14#cldf:5-3)), but this appears to have meant ‘deaf and dumb’.

<a id="s-8-3"></a>

### 8.3. Snot, nasal mucus



<a id="p-199"></a>

Three POc terms for ‘snot’ are reconstructed. It seems probable that POc _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘snot’ is historically the same root as _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘grunt, growl, snore’ ([§4.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-3#cldf:5-3)) and the root of POc _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ ‘channel above upper lip’ ([§3.4.11](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-11#cldf:5-3)), the more so as the visible manifestation of snot is above the upper lip of small children. Wayan Fijian distinguishes three kinds of mucus: _drove_ ‘phlegm, thick mucus in the throat or lungs’, a reflex of POc _&ast;(dr,d)ap(e,i)_ below; _dakwa_ ‘snot’; and _drakwa_ ‘white mucus secreted by the eye’, but it is impossible to provide more specific glosses for the POc reconstructions below.

Other NCV languages refer to ‘nasal mucus’ with reflexes of POc _&ast;suRuq_ ‘juice, fluid’ (Lolovoli _suru_, NE Ambae _suru_).

[PPn &ast;_isu-peqe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-8-3-200-PPn-isupeqe-a)

No form is reconstructed to account for the following terms but it seems likely that they are somehow related to PAn _&ast;Siŋus_ / PMP _&ast;hiŋus_ ‘sniff, sniffle (as with a runny nose)’ (ACD).

### 8.4. Saliva


Most terms for ‘saliva’ appear specifically to denote spittle, and are found in [§4.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-3#cldf:5-3), as they are identical with or derived from a verb meaning ‘spit’. However, it is possible that POc speakers labelled saliva ‘water of mouth’, as this expression is found at widespread locations. It is, however, such an obvious compound that it may have arisen independently at different times and places.

### 8.5. Semen, smegma


Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;biRas_ or _&ast;biRaq_ ‘semen, smegma’, both resulting in POc _&ast;biRa_, but each rests on a single non-Oceanic reflex[^55] plus the Oceanic reflexes below whose meanings most consistently denote stale or unwanted material such as sediment left after processing. No Oceanic reflex denotes ‘semen’, but Polynesian reflexes include reference to smegma (penile mucus) and vaginal mucus, suggesting that these were among its POc denotations.

Euphemistic labels for semen seem to be quite common, and PCP _&ast;sī_ perhaps originated in this way.


<a id="p-202"></a>

[PCP &ast;_sī_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-3-8-5-202-PCP-si-a)

NCV languages use reflexes of POc _&ast;suRuq_ ‘juice, fluid’ to refer to a range of bodily fluids including variously snot, tears and semen: (Avava _a-sur_ ‘semen’, Raga _hu-_ ‘oil, liquid, juice, semen’). Some languages refer to semen euphemistically as ‘his water’, e.g. Nyindrou (Adm) _gʷa ta-n_ [water PREP-his], ’Are’are (SES) _wai-na_ [water-his]. Other euphemisms include Lukep (NNG) _gorenge_ (from POc _&ast;g(o.u)reŋ_ ‘coconut milk, coconut cream’; [vol.3:372](ContributionTable?anchor=p-372#cldf:3-12)), Kwaio _bula-bula-_ ‘saliva’ and Lonwolwol (NCV) _atu-_ ‘seed’


<a id="s-8-6"></a>

### 8.6. Faeces, excrement


Two terms are reconstructed. POc _&ast;taqe-_ ‘faeces’ was primarily a noun. POc _&ast;pekas_ was a verb, ‘defecate’, but seems also to have been used as a noun meaning ‘faeces’. The cognate set reflecting _&ast;pekas_ is given in [§4.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-8#cldf:5-3).

### 9.1. Shadow, reflection, image, likeness


It is clear from the glosses below that POc _&ast;[qa]nunu_ and POc _&ast;qata(r)_ meant more than ‘shadow, reflection, image’. They also denoted a person’s soul/spirit/personality.[^57]

Oceanic terms for ‘name’ are also usually directly possessed. Two similar POc forms, _&ast;[q]aca(n,ŋ)_/_&ast;[q]aca-_ and _&ast;i(s,c)aŋ_/_&ast;i(s,c)a-_, are reconstructable. To our knowledge, no language has reflexes of both, but quite commonly where one language reflects _&ast;[q]aca(n,ŋ)_, its close relative reflects _&ast;i(s,c)aŋ_ (e.g. Tuam vs Malai, Suau vs Kakabai, Tigak vs Tolai, Mwotlap vs Araki). We have no explanation for this.

Reconstructing the initial consonant of POc _&ast;[q]aca[n,ŋ]_ ‘name’ has proved problematic. The PMP form was evidently _&ast;[ŋ]ajan_, with the loss of initial _&ast;ŋ-_ occurring prior to POc. Proto Eastern Admiralties reflexes actually reflect PEAd _&ast;nq-_, and reflexes of ‘name’ have the same initials as other _&ast;nq_-initial items. Evidence that _&ast;q-_ is not an Admiralties innovation, however, lies with Apalik _kasaŋ_. John Lynch adds that evidence from Tanna languages suggests that _&ast;q_ was ancestral to these forms too (pers. comm. and see also [Lynch 2001c](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c):120).

The Dami/Matukar/Takia form yaŋa- appears to reflect _&ast;i(s,c)aŋa-_ rather than the expected _&ast;i(s,c)a-_, i.e. the consonant-final form with an extension to accommodate the possessor suffix.

## Notes

[^1]: We are grateful to Paul Geraghty who has commented on an earlier version of this chapter and made a number of additions to the data.

[^2]: Terms for parts of animals are reconstructed in [volume 4 (ch.2, §66](ContributionTable?anchor=s-66#cldf:4-2); [ch.5, §7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:5-5); [ch.6, §2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:5-6)); terms for parts of plants in chapter 5 of volume 3; and relational local nouns in [volume 2 (ch.8, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:2-8)).

[^3]: PSV had two terms for both ‘blood’ and ‘excrement’, one of which involves a specific possessor while the other refers to the substance in isolation without being linked to any possessor ([Lynch 2001c](Source#cldf:Lynch2001c):259).

[^4]: Blust (ACD) takes _&ast;tuqelan_ ‘bone’ to have no Oceanic reflexes but reconstructs POc _&ast;tuqa_ with the sense ‘back’. Our data do not support this as the primary gloss.

[^5]: [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:Blust1993), 2009) reconstructed PCEMP _&ast;zuRi_ ‘bone’ as parent of POc _&ast;suRi_, but the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) now attributes its CMP reflexes to PMP _&ast;duRi_ ‘thorn, splinter, fishbone’, continued as POc _&ast;(dr,r)uRi_ ‘thorn’ ([vol.1:125](ContributionTable?anchor=p-125#cldf:1-5)).

[^6]: The Patpatar microgroup includes the Patpatar, Minigir and Tolai languages, the Label microgroup Label and Bilur, the Kandas microgroup Kandas and Ramoaaina, the Buka microgroup Solos, Halia and Selau.

[^7]: A significant part of NW Solomonic is missing from the list because Torau, Mono-Alu, Nduke, and the Santa Isabel languages reflect &ast;suma ‘bone’.

[^8]: Proto Korap was ancestral to Barim, Lukep and Malasanga.

[^9]: This form could also reflect POc _&ast;pulu-_ ‘body hair’ ([§3.3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-8#cldf:5-3)), but the gloss suggests that it reflects POc _&ast;puRu-_.

[^10]: This form may reflect PMP _&ast;palpal_ ‘bald’ ([Dempwolff 1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938)). If it does, however, it is irregular, as the expected POc form would be †_&ast;papal_.

[^11]: A number of modern languages have a compound that implies the presence of the POc phrase _&ast;pulu qi manuk_ ‘_&ast;pulu_ of bird’, i.e. ‘feathers’ (Motu (PT) _manu hui(na)_ and the Polynesian languages Nukuoro _hulu manu_, Anuta _puru o manu_, Hawaiian _hulu manu_).

[^12]: In Vitu _-k_ has been added to certain inalienables ([van den Berg & Bachet 2006](Source#cldf:vandenBergandBachet2006)), perhaps reflecting the POc free noun suffix _&ast;-ki_, added to inalienables that were not possessed ([Ross 2001b](Source#cldf:Ross2001b):273–274).

[^13]: The gloss suggests that this form reflects a conflation of POc _&ast;pulu-_ ‘body hair’ and POc _&ast;puRu-_ ‘head hair’ ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-3)) resulting from a merger of the reflexes of POc _&ast;-l-_ and _&ast;-R-_.

[^14]: Laghu _pulu-_ could also reflect POc _&ast;puRu_ ‘head hair’, but the sense ‘pubic hair’ suggests that it reflects _&ast;pulu_.

[^15]: This inference seems more plausible than Blust’s (ACD) that the CMP items reflect PMP _&ast;batu_ ‘stone’ rather than PMP _&ast;batuk_.

[^16]: An alternative is that we have misread the sound correspondence, as there are very few Bougainville reflexes of terms that include _&ast;bʷ_.

[^17]: Only found in BPMs in our data.

[^18]: Bugotu pau appears to have no other SES cognates and is perhaps borrowed from Maringe.

[^19]: Blust (ACD) treats PMP _&ast;hutek_ and POc _&ast;qutok_ as ‘a remarkable chance similarity’, but the fact that final _&ast;-k_ is reflected in Lenakel speaks against this interpretation and in favour of an idiosyncratic acquisition of POc initial _&ast;q_.

[^20]: The meaning of PEPn _&ast;-ariŋa_ is unknown, but note NNG: Bukawa _aliŋ ando_ ‘cheek’.

[^21]: Blust (ACD) reconstructs _&ast;bahaq_, but his discussion implies that reduplication occurred in early Malayo-Polynesian as a result of reduction to _&ast;baq_.

[^22]: In vol.2:.111 PPn _&ast;awa_ was incorrectly listed as a reflex of POc _&ast;sawa(n,ŋ)_ ‘channel, passage’ with unexplained loss of _&ast;s-_.

[^23]: It is not clear exactly what this gloss means.

[^24]: For a brief discussion of _&ast;qa-_, see [§3.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-3#cldf:5-3).

[^25]: The gloss ‘flat object or surface’ was omitted in volume 1.

[^26]: A few nouns which label plants or animals display the same pattern: PWOc _&ast;[qa]pwasu_ ‘taro leaves’ (?) ([vol.3:269](ContributionTable?anchor=p-269#cldf:3-9)), PEOc _&ast;[qa]ŋaRi_ ‘canarium almond’ ([vol.3:315](ContributionTable?anchor=p-315#cldf:3-11)), POc _&ast;[qa]paliR_ ‘surgeonfish’ (vol 4:103), POc _&ast;[qa]nupe_ ‘caterpillar or k.o. sea cucumber’ ([vol.4:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:4-4)), POc _[qa]yawan_ ‘strangler fig’ ([vol.3:303](ContributionTable?anchor=p-303#cldf:3-10)), POc _&ast;[qa]pator_ ‘sago grub, edible’ ([vol.4:404](ContributionTable?anchor=p-404#cldf:4-7)), POc _&ast;[qa]liliŋ_ ‘tapestry turban shell’ ([vol.4:182](ContributionTable?anchor=p-182#cldf:4-4)), POc _&ast;[qa]lipan_ ‘centipede’ ([vol.4:406](ContributionTable?anchor=p-406#cldf:4-7)). Some of these are reconstructed without the _&ast;qa_-less alternant, but reflexes reflect absence of _&ast;qa-_. The only discernible regularity regarding the presence or absence of _&ast;qa-_ in reflexes is that it is apparently always absent in Gela, with a tendency towards absence in other Guadalcanal languages and in New Ireland languages—but absences also occur elsewhere.

[^27]: Final _&ast;-k-_ probably the Vitu reflex of POc _&ast;-ki_ ‘not possessed’. See footnote 12.

[^28]: A term with the gloss ‘rib’ does occur in a number of sources. In some cases at least this appears to be an error for ‘ribs’ or ‘rib cage’.

[^29]: A double asterisk (&ast;&ast;) is used here for forms that appear to be reconstructable but which we explain here as due to post-POc changes.

[^30]: A more complicated explanation involving vowel dissimilation is also possible, but there is no other evidence for this in POc.

[^31]: Note that the converse conflation, taking _&ast;p-_ from _&ast;puso-_ and _&ast;-t-_ from _&ast;bʷito-_, i.e. †_&ast;&ast;puto_/_pito_, is not attested.

[^32]: We cannot locate the source of Ozanne-Rivierre’s cited reconstruction.

[^33]: We owe to John Lynch the insight that this was a PSOc innovation.

[^34]: Bam _ve-_ and Wogeo _vai-_ are regular reflexes of POc _&ast;qaqe_. Cf. Wogeo _vawa-_ ‘mouth’ < POc _&ast;qawa-_, _valiŋa-_ ‘voice’ < POc _&ast;qaliŋa-_, _vato_ ‘thatch’ < POc _&ast;qatop_.

[^35]: There were very few monosyllabic POc nouns, so we do not know whether this was a general POc strategy for creating disyllabic directly possessed nouns from monosyllabic roots. Blust (ACD) rejects (rightly, in our view) an alternative analysis whereby POc _&ast;turu-_ continues PAn _&ast;tuduS_ via PMP †_&ast;tuduh_. His grounds are (i) that -CVS metathesis was regular and (ii) that PMP †_&ast;tuduh_ is not reflected in western MP languages.

[^36]: Final _-t_ reflects Proto Huon Gulf _&ast;-c_, a formative added to directly possessed nouns lacking a possessor ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):144) which was apparently an irregular reflex of POc _&ast;-ki_ ([Ross 2001b](Source#cldf:Ross2001b)).

[^37]: Ramoaaina _talia_ ‘nut of _Terminalia catappa_’, reflecting POc _&ast;talise_ ([vol.3:324](ContributionTable?anchor=p-324#cldf:3-11)).

[^38]: X represents the human possessor of the heel.

[^39]: Fijian examples include _levu-ka-_ ‘middle’, _tolo-ka-_ ‘trunk’, _vatu-ka-_ ‘shape’ (P. Geraghty, pers. comm.)

[^40]: Glosses in [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) show no semantic difference between _pʷa-ruru-_ ‘elbow, knee’ and _ruru-_ ‘elbow, knee’.

[^41]: Thus POc _&ast;buku_ is glossed ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood, string or rope’ in [vol.1:85](ContributionTable?anchor=p-85#cldf:1-4); ‘mound, knob, joint’, possibly also ‘hill’ in [vol.2:51](ContributionTable?anchor=p-51#cldf:2-3); and its PCP reflex denotes ‘female genitals’ in [§3.5.13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-13#cldf:5-3).3.

[^42]: PAn _&ast;dapaN_ is reconstructed on the basis of (Formosan) Tsou _caphə_ ‘foot’, Saaroa _sapale_ ‘foot’, Thao _sapað_ ‘sole, footprint’, Pazih _sa-sapal_ ‘sole’ and (Philippine) Ilokano, Bikol, Pangasinan _dapan_ ‘sole’ (among other reflexes).

[^43]: The full gloss in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) is ‘fruit; areca palm and nut; grain; berry; seed; nut; endosperm of a sprouting coconut; kidney; heart; finger; calf of the leg; testicle; various insects; scar tissue; roe; bud; flower; blossom; bear fruit; words, speech, or songs; meaning, contents of discussion; numeral classifier for roundish objects; buttock; Adam’s apple; nipple of the breast; button; marble; tattooing’

[^44]: The reconstruction in [vol.2(97](ContributionTable?anchor=p-97#cldf:2-4)) is _&ast;puso_. but the external evidence suggests _&ast;puco(q)_. # FIXME: correct in vol 2?

[^45]: There is no non-Oceanic evidence for the final _&ast;-q_ of POc _&ast;paraq_ ‘spongy mass…’, and its apparent presence may be the result of conflations with _&ast;paRa(q)_ ‘lung’.

[^46]:  POc _&ast;tobʷa_ ‘bag’ should have been included in [vol.1, ch. 4, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:1-4), but it was omitted there.

[^47]: Cf. PPn _&ast;mānawa_ ‘breathe; breath’ ([§3.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-6#cldf:5-3), [§4.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-1#cldf:5-3)).

[^48]: If _&ast;⟨in⟩_ was a nominaliser, then _&ast;Caqi_ would also be expected to have served as a verb (‘defecate’), but there is no evidence of this.

[^49]: He writes, ‘Since PMP _&ast;qalejaw_ ‘day’ apparently has become POc _&ast;qajo_ …, it is conceivable that a parallel change in PAn _&ast;qapeju_ ‘gall, gall bladder’ could have given rise to the forms cited here. … [T]his hypothesis fails to explain why languages such as Bipi, Lindrou, Likum, Papitalai, Pak, Penchal, and Nauna, which distinguish PAn/POc _&ast;s_ from _&ast;j_, point to POc _&ast;s_ as the medial consonant in this form. PAn _&ast;qapeju_ and POc _&ast;qasu_ thus appear to have no historical connection.’

[^50]: In many languages of Vanuatu, evident reflexes of _&ast;mabʷe_ mean ‘liver’, resulting in the reconstruction of PNCV _&ast;mʷabʷe_ ‘liver’ ([Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) and PSV _&ast;mabʷV-_ ‘liver’ (Lynch 2001).

[^51]: The unetymological _ʔ-_ here perhaps results from a transcription error.

[^52]: POc _&ast;suRuq_ ‘sap, soup, drinkable liquid derived from plants, fruits or trees’ ([vol.3:369](ContributionTable?anchor=p-369#cldf:3-12)). POc _&ast;waiR_ ‘water’ ([vol.2:57](ContributionTable?anchor=p-57#cldf:2-3)).

[^53]: Blust (ACD) asks the same question with regard to PMP _&ast;tuli_. Because there are other terms for ‘deaf’ but nor for ‘earwax’, he concludes that it meant the latter, and that an extension to ‘deaf’ has happened more than once at various times and places.

[^54]: Although Blust (ACD) glosses these POc reconstructions as shown here, he labels them as doublets, implying that they are alternant forms with the same meaning, i.e. both ‘earwax’ and ‘deaf’.

[^55]: PMP _&ast;biRas_ rests on Sangir _bihaseʔ_ ‘semen, smegma, vaginal fluid’, _&ast;biRaq_ on Maranao _bigaʔ_ ‘semen, sperm, egg’.

[^56]: Paul Geraghty, pers. comm., language not identified.

[^57]: This aspect of POc _&ast;[qa]nunu_ or _&ast;qata(r)_ is not investigated here, as it properly belongs in volume 6.

## 1. Introduction


The reconstructions presented in this chapter cover a wide semantic range of verbs concerned with posture and movement. The semantic domain is a complex one, and the reader will find more reference to the typological literature than in other chapters in these volumes, in an effort to make sense of the domain’s structure in Proto Oceanic. Languages structure the posture and movement domain in different ways, and Oceanic languages have their own shared peculiarities in this regard, described at appropriate points in the chapter.

The most important division is into posture verbs and movement verbs. Posture verbs in turn are divided into cardinal posture verbs—those denoting ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’, found in most languages around the world and often used as simple verbs of location (‘be at’)—and non-cardinal posture verbs, which are more culturally specific. The subdomain of movement verbs is much more complex. There are straightforward movement verbs like ‘go’, ‘fly’ and ‘descend’ (§[§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-6)–6.5), which have a single argument, the theme (the person or thing that is moved), and there are caused movement verbs like ‘raise’, ‘carry’, ‘put’ and ‘send’, which have two arguments: an agent that causes movement and a theme which moves. These complexities are discussed at greater length below.

## 2. Posture verbs


Posture verbs are verbs meaning ‘sit’, ‘stand’, ‘lie’, ‘hang’, ‘lean’, ‘squat’, ‘kneel’ and the like. These can be divided into cardinal and non-cardinal posture verbs. Cardinal posture verbs have the meanings ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’ and have a broader range of use in many languages than non-cardinal posture verbs, i.e. verbs denoting other postures (‘hang’ etc) and verbs denoting a more specific posture (e.g. ‘sit crosslegged’) than the cardinal posture verbs.

The cardinal posture verbs ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’ have two kinds of use in many of the world’s languages, including Oceanic. In the first use they are simply intransitive verbs denoting the posture of their subject (‘Mary is sitting’). They are often accompanied by a location (‘Mary is sitting on a chair’). This gives rise to their second use, as default verbs in locative constructions ([Ameka & Levinson 2007](Source#cldf:AmekaandLevinson2007), [Lichtenberk 2002](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002)). A locative construction is one that answers the question ‘Where is X?’. Across languages locative constructions come in three main kinds:[^1]

 1. a construction with no copula (‘The cup — on the table’)
 2. a construction with a copula verb corresponding to English be (‘The cup __is__ on the table’),
 3. a construction with a posture verb (‘The cup __sits__ on the table’. ‘The vase __stands__ on the
    table’).


<a id="p-368"></a>

Oceanic languages tend to have constructions of types 1 and 3, but not type 2. The Seimat (Adm) sentence below is of type 1:[^2]

[5-6-2-None-368-6](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-2-None-368-6)

The difference between a postural and a locative use is that in the latter, the verb is bleached of its postural meaning. Thus Manam (NNG) has a type 3 locative construction where the verb _-eno_ ‘lie’ is used in locative and existential sentences[^3] with abstract subjects where there is no postural orientation at all.

[5-6-2-None-368-7](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-2-None-368-7)

[5-6-2-None-368-8](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-2-None-368-8)

With a human subject, on the other hand, _-soaʔi_ ‘sit’ is used in a locative sentence, again with no postural implication:

[5-6-2-None-368-9](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-2-None-368-9)

The choice of _-eno_ ‘lie’, rather than _-soaʔi_, with a human subject is clearly a postural usage.

[5-6-2-None-368-10](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-2-None-368-10)

As these Manam examples show, the choice of posture verb depends on two factors. The first is whether the intended construction is locative or postural. If it is locative, then the second factor comes into play, namely the conventional collocation of particular nouns or semantic categories of nouns with a given posture verb. These collocations vary from language to language and almost always involve ‘sit’, ‘stand’ or ‘lie’ ([Lichtenberk 2002](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002):273–274, 305; see also [Early 2000](Source#cldf:Early2000)). Non-cardinal posture verbs almost never occur in a locative construction.

The three main posture verbs are also often used as aspectual verbs in Oceanic languages, usually as the second verb of a serial verb construction, but [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002):270) thinks these meanings are impossible to reconstruct (and I agree with him) as different languages reflect different developments. He also thinks that reconstructing uses of posture verbs as default locative verbs is impossible. Here I am a little more sanguine ([§6.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-1#cldf:5-6)).


<a id="p-369"></a>

Typically in Oceanic languages intransitive verbs encode both posture and assumption of posture (inchoative posture). The latter use is sometimes distinguished by a path element meaning ‘upward’ or ‘downward’. Path was probably encoded in POc as the second verb of a serial verb construction, as in Mussau _toka sio_ ‘sit down’ and _tiŋina sae_ ‘stand up’, where _sio_ ‘go down’ and _sae_ ‘go up’ are verbs of vertical direction ([vol.2:260](ContributionTable?anchor=p-260#cldf:2-8)-267). Such usages were certainly conventionalised in POc and were perhaps also grammaticised, like Manam _go-soaʔi-ria_ [2SG. IRR-sit-go. down] ‘sit down’ ([Lichtenberk 2002](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002):269-270) or Carolinian _sɔ̄-tiw_ [settle-go. down] ‘alight, land (of flying things)’.

Some Oceanic languages have transitives with a location object, e.g. Bugotu _mono_ ‘abide, stay, dwell, be at’ vs _monoŋ-i-_ ‘abide in’; To’aba’ita _ʔono_ ‘sit’ vs _ʔonof-i-_ ‘sit on’ ([Lichtenberk 2002](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2002):269), Wayan _toko_ ‘squat; sit on one’s heels or haunches’ vs _tokoði-_ ‘squat or sit on’. Our sources are often silent on this matter, but there are sometimes enough reflexes to support the reconstruction of transitives.

In addition to cardinal posture verbs, verbs meaning ‘squat’, ‘kneel’ and ‘hang’ can be reconstructed, but they are not nearly as widely reflected as cardinal verbs. Many languages also cut the main domains into smaller, more specific ones. For example, as well as _soaʔi_ ‘sit’ Manam has _basaʔi_ ‘sit cross-legged’ ([Newman 2002](Source#cldf:Newman2002):3). However, the data do not permit reconstruction of such semantically narrow posture verbs.


<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Sit, be located


Two POc forms meaning ‘sit, stay, dwell’ are reconstructable: _&ast;mono(ŋ)_/_&ast;monoŋ-i_ and POc _&ast;nopo(q)_. A third form, _&ast;mia[n]_, is reconstructed subject to certain caveats mentioned below. Significantly, a purely postural meaning (‘sit’) is reconstructable for none of these verbs. In all three instances, reflexes tend to mean ‘sit’, ‘stay’ or ‘dwell’ or a combination of these, whereas reflexes of reconstructions meaning ‘stand’ ([§6.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-2#cldf:5-6)) and ‘lie’ ([§6.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-3#cldf:5-6)) tend to have glosses with only a postural sense. There is a reason for this. In traditional Oceanic societies there were no chairs or custom-made seats. People sat or squatted on the ground, so any ‘sit’ verb would not have had the postural sense of English sit but would have meant ‘be located’ and have been a candidate for service as the default POc locative verb.[^4]

Reflexes of the widely reflected POc _&ast;toka_ ‘come to rest, settle (of vessel, on reef)’ also fall into the ‘sit, stay, dwell’ domain, but its POc meaning seems to have been narrower and indeed inchoative, a matter discussed below.

[POc &ast;_mono(ŋ)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-1-369-POc-mono-a)


<a id="p-370"></a>

POc _&ast;nopo(q)_ ‘sit, stay, dwell’ is reconstructed with possible final _&ast;-q_ on the basis of Polynesian reflexes, as Polynesian languages preserve root-final consonants in transitive verbs more faithfully than SE Solomonic languages like Lau below. Wayan Fijian shows two apparent reflexes of _&ast;nopo(q)_. Wayan _novo_ is the regular reflex, whereas _nō_ is irregular, as is Bauan _no_. The items listed under ‘cf. also’ may be cognate, but they display irregularities.

[POc &ast;_nopo(q)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-1-370-POc-nopoq-a)


<a id="p-371"></a>

If Drehet (Adm) _-miŋ_ ‘sit’ and/or Ponapean (Mic) _mi_ ‘exist, be (at)’ reflect _&ast;mia[n]_, as they appear to, then POc _&ast;mia[n]_ ‘sit, stay, live’ can also be reconstructed. If not, then the form is of PWOc antiquity. Final _-ŋ_ of Drehet _-miŋ_ appears to reflect an added morpheme, as Admiralties languages lose POc final consonants. Evidence as to whether _&ast;mia[n]_ has a final _&ast;-n_ is ambiguous, and Bali reflects it both without (_mia_ ‘dwell’) and with _&ast;-n_ (_miaŋa_, a regular reflex).

[POc &ast;_mia&#91;n&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-1-371-POc-mian-a)


<a id="p-372"></a>

The primary sense of POc _&ast;toka_ was apparently one of settling in a position following movement, giving rise to glosses like ‘settle down’, ‘hit the bottom (of particles in suspension in a liquid and of canoes’ and ‘land (after flying)’. In many languages its reflex denotes the result of settling, ranging from ‘stuck on the reef’ (Roro [PT]) and ‘be aground’ (Tongan [Pn]) to the more general ‘sit’, ‘stay’ or ‘dwell’. In Poeng, Gela, Sa’a and PCP reflexes occur, sometimes with a qualifier, with the meaning ‘sit on one’s haunches, squat’, and this seems to have been a subsidiary meaning, overlapping with the domain of POc _&ast;tike_ ([§6.2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-4#cldf:5-6).1).

A number of reflexes point to a possible alternant _&ast;toko_, and a few to a short alternant _&ast;tok_. Thus Nehan toko reflects _&ast;tok_ with a regular echo vowel; the expected reflex of POc _&ast;toka_ is †toa.

[PMP &ast;_tekas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-1-372-POc-toka-a)


<a id="p-373"></a>


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Stand


Two POc verbs for ‘stand’ are reconstructable: _&ast;tuqur_ ‘stand’ and _&ast;madriRi_ ‘be standing upright’. Both have PMP antecedents. Apparently no language in the data reflects both terms, with a reflex of _&ast;tuqur_ sometimes occurring in one language and a reflex of _&ast;madriRi_ in a quite closely related language. The competition between them seems to have been won in EOc languages by _&ast;tuqur_, as there are no EOc reflexes of _&ast;madriRi_.


<a id="p-374"></a>

PNCV appears to have had two reflexes of POc _&ast;tuqur_, namely _&ast;tuqu_ and _&ast;tuquru_ ([Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs _&ast;tuqu-ru_). PNCV _&ast;tuʔu_ is the expected reflex. PNCV _&ast;tuquru_ reflects the POc form plus an echo vowel, a minority pattern that occurs from time to time in PNCV.

The Choiseul forms shown under ‘cf. also’ have expected consonant reflexes but the ‘wrong’ vowels. It is tempting to attribute them to an ‘Old Oceanic’ substrate ([Ross 2010](Source#cldf:Ross2010):263).

A set of forms reflecting apparent POc &ast;tutu follows below, and may or may not ultimately reflect POc _&ast;tuqur_.

[PMP &ast;_tuqud_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-2-374-POc-tuqur-a)


<a id="p-375"></a>


<a id="p-376"></a>

The set below appears to reflect something like POc _&ast;tutu_. It is not clear whether this is an idiosyncratic alternant of _&ast;tuqur_ or not. What is obvious is that the first _&ast;-u-_ has a variety of reflexes, suggesting that its POc stress fell on the second syllable, leading to reduction or loss of the first _&ast;-u-_.

[POc &ast;_tutu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-2-376-POc-tutu-a)

The set below is restricted to WOc languages but is clearly inherited from PAn. However, a PMP form with _&ast;ma-_, i.e. _&ast;ma-diRi_, has not been reconstructed, and would in any case have resulted in POc †_&ast;ma-riri_. Instead the presence of _&ast;-dr-_ in POc _&ast;madriRi_ suggests earlier †_&ast;ma-n-diRi_. CMP languages with a nasal prefix occur (the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) lists Fordata _n-diri_ and Kei _en-dir_), but not enough is known about pre-Oceanic diachronic morphology to allow a firm pre-Oceanic reconstruction.[^5]


<a id="p-377"></a>

[PAn &ast;_diRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-2-377-POc-madriri-a)

The NNG and PT forms listed below may also reflect POc _&ast;madriRi_. They allow the reconstruction of putative PNGOc _&ast;midi_ ‘stand’. If the latter reflects POc _&ast;madriRi_, then two idiosyncratic changes must be inferred: (a) _&ast;ma-_ became _&ast;mi-_ by assimilation to the _&ast;-i-_ of _&ast;-driRi_; (b) loss of the final syllable _&ast;-Ri_. Change (a) is also reflected in Dawawa _-(wai)midiri_ ‘stand s.t. up’ and Misima _mílil_ above, and change (b) in Kilenge _-mari_, Tami _moji_, Sio _-madi_ and Vitu _madi_. It is thus not unexpected that the two changes have sometimes occurred simultaneously, and the terms listed below may well reflect independent parallel innovations rather than a single PNGOc innovation.

<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Lie


One POc term, _&ast;qenop_, is reconstructed for ‘lie, rest horizontally’. A good many reflexes also mean ‘sleep’, but this is a natural development from ‘lie’. Distinct terms for ‘sleep’ are reconstructed in [§4.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-1#cldf:5-6).

Blust (ACD) reconstructs the PAn term _&ast;qinep_, of which the expected POc reflex is †_&ast;qinop_. He also reconstructs the doublet PEMP _&ast;qenəp_,[^6] reflected as POc _&ast;qenop_. He apparently infers that both forms were inherited into POc because a few terms in _-i-_ occur in NNG languages, listed below under ‘cf. also’. One might alternatively infer, however, that these reflect a NNG height assimilation. Also listed under ‘cf. also’ is the form inep, reflected in three South New Ireland languages. The presence of _-e-_ for †_-o-_ in the second syllable is unexplained.

The distribution of reflexes of _&ast;qenop_ shows some curious restrictions. Regular reflexes occur nowhere in MM, in apparently only a few northern NCV languages, and not at all in Micronesian or Central Pacific languages. In each of these areas other terms, some of them words for ‘sleep’, have replaced _&ast;qenop_, but it is not clear why this replacement is so widespread. The only fairly widespread replacement is PCP _&ast;koto_/PPn _&ast;ta-koto_ below. PPn _ta-_ appears to reflect POc _&ast;ta-_, which marks the event denoted by the verb as spontaneous. However, it is difficult to conceive of lying down as spontaneous.

### 2.4. Non-cardinal posture verbs



<a id="s-2-4-1"></a>

#### 2.4.1. Squat, sit on haunches


Sitting on one’s haunches is still a posture frequently assumed in traditional villages in Northwest Melanesia, so the reconstruction of POc _&ast;tike_ ‘squat, sit on haunches’ is no surprise. More of a surprise is that its reflexes are few, perhaps because its meaning is not collected by linguists who use a standard word list, but their distribution points clearly to its presence in POc.

[POc &ast;_tike_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-4-380-POc-tike-a)


<a id="s-2-4-2"></a>

#### 2.4.2. Kneel


No POc term for ‘kneel’ has been reconstructed, but a small cognate set points to PWOc _&ast;tudruŋ_ ‘kneel’. This is evidently related to POc _&ast;turu-_ ‘knee, joint’ ([§3.6.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-5#cldf:5-6).2). As dr is the prenasalised equivalent of _&ast;r_, it is possible that _&ast;tudruŋ_ reflects infixation of PMP _&ast;⟨um⟩_, which formed intransitive verbs, i.e. _&ast;tudruŋ_ reflects earlier _&ast;t⟨um⟩uruŋ_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-6).5). Final _&ast;-ŋ_ is unaccounted for.

[PWOc &ast;_tudruŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-4-380-PWOc-tudru-a)


<a id="p-381"></a>

Nakanai in the west and Fijian and Polynesian in the east have compounds with two components, the first a verb meaning ‘stand (a pole or spear) up straight’ or a noun meaning ‘supporting pole, stake’ and the second the term for ‘knee’. They form a collocation which perhaps occurred in POc and which one might translate into English as ‘to knee-stand’. The data below do not allow a POc reconstruction, but the Polynesian terms point to a possible PPn _&ast;toko-turi_ (_&ast;toko_ (V) ‘support, prop up’, (N) ‘supporting pole, stake’; _&ast;turi_ ‘knee’).

[5-6-2-4-381-mm-nakanai-tototulu](cf.csv#cldf:5-6-2-4-381-mm-nakanai-tototulu)


<a id="s-2-4-3"></a>

#### 2.4.3. Hang


Of the postures, ‘hang’ has proven the most difficult to reconstruct forms for, but the reason for this is clear. Oceanic languages have a variety of intransitive verbs of hanging (some of which seem to be used transitively without derivation), but they differ from each other semantically, and the same was presumably true of POc. Often dictionaries, let alone wordlists, do not provide distinctive glosses for ‘hang’ words. The following three lists are illustrative.

| _tiro_   | ‘hang down, droop (a dress, line, banana leaves)’             |

The most widely reflected, and perhaps the most neutral, term for ‘hang’ is POc _&ast;tau(r)_.

[POc &ast;_tau(r)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-2-4-382-POc-taur-a)

There is evidence to allow a more specific gloss for POc _&ast;tuku_ below, ‘(person) hang by the arms, dangle’, but data on which POc _&ast;sorop_ ‘hang’ and POc _&ast;kuRu_ (VI) ‘hang’ are based do not allow a more specific gloss. In the _&ast;kuRu_ set the To’aba’ita gloss indicates the kind of hanging the verb denotes, but a single gloss is an insufficient basis for a POc gloss.

#### 2.4.4. Lean, slant


POc _&ast;pʷaralat_ ‘be leaning, slanting’ is a posture verb, but the glosses suggest that its typical use was with inanimate rather than human subjects. The medial consonant correspondences are irregular, and the most natural inference is that Seimat reflects _&ast;-r-_ and _&ast;-l-_ regularly (as do the Polynesian reflexes), whilst the remaining languages reflect assimilations. The Malaita-Makira form _hatara_ is probably cognate, but its history is less clear.

There is a copious literature on movement verbs and movement constructions in the world’s languages, much of it stemming from the work of Leonard [Talmy](Source#cldf:Talmy1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Talmy1972), [1974](Source#cldf:Talmy1974), [1985](Source#cldf:Talmy1985), [1991](Source#cldf:Talmy1991), [2000](Source#cldf:Talmy2000)). Talmy observed that languages tend to have either movement constructions in which the main verb encodes the manner of motion, as in English as in _He_ ___ran___ _greinto the cave_, or movement constructions in which it encodes the path of motion, as in Spanish ___Entró___ _corriendo a la cueva_ [__entered.3SG__ running to the cave]. Path is encoded in the English example by the preposition _into_, and manner in the Spanish example by the participle _corriendo_ ‘running’.[^7]

These English and Spanish movement constructions each have just one finite verb. Talmy’s classification also allows for serial verb constructions like those which occur in Oceanic languages, discussed in [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Ross2004a)) and briefly in [vol.2(257](ContributionTable?anchor=p-257#cldf:2-8)–258), and illustrated in this Hoava (MM) example:[^8]


<a id="p-385"></a>

[5-6-3-None-385-11](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-3-None-385-11)

In this construction, the elements of manner, path and deixis are each encoded by a finite verb, respectively of locomotion, geographic direction ([vol.2:259](ContributionTable?anchor=p-259#cldf:2-8)–267) and deictic direction ([vol.2:269](ContributionTable?anchor=p-269#cldf:2-8)–282). This ordering also occurs in other language families, e.g. in Thai ([Thepkanjana 1986](Source#cldf:Thepkanjana1986):136). Omission of any one of the three elements is quite common, as here in Hoava.

[5-6-3-None-385-12](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-3-None-385-12)

Elaboration of this manner–path–deixis schema, often by the presence of more than one path verb, is quite common across Oceanic languages, as in this Tuam (NNG) sentence:[^9]

[5-6-3-None-385-13](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-3-None-385-13)

Talmy’s original classification of movement constructions and verbs did not include a deictic element, but [Talmy](Source#cldf:Talmy2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Talmy2008)) treats deixis as a subpart of path. Path and deixis are typically encoded separately in Oceanic languages, but in some of them verbs of deixis have been grammaticised as a separate morpheme class ([Ross 2004a](Source#cldf:Ross2004a)).

The remainder of this section is concerned with verbs of locomotion, i.e. verbs that occur in the manner slot of a movement construction. Verbs of geographic and deictic direction, filling the path and deixis slots, are reconstructed in [vol.2(259](ContributionTable?anchor=p-259#cldf:2-8)–272).

Verbs of locomotion can be conveniently divided according to the medium on/in which movement takes place: on land ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6)), in the air ([§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:5-6)) or in water ([§3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3#cldf:5-6)).


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Locomotion on land


Verbs of land-based locomotion include meanings like ‘go’, ‘walk’, ‘run’, ‘crawl’, ‘creep’, ‘limp’, ‘hop’ and ‘roll’.


<a id="s-3-1-1"></a>

#### 3.1.1. Go, move


The broadest of these meanings is ‘go’, which in some Oceanic languages also denotes sea- based locomotion. Traditional travel on land was always on foot, and so the ‘go’ verb often also means ‘go on foot, walk’. The verbs of deictic direction away from the speaker or towards a location other than the speaker, described in [vol.2(273](ContributionTable?anchor=p-273#cldf:2-8)-282), all seem to have been polysemous insofar as they also served as verbs of locomotion with the basic meaning ‘go’. These verbs were:


<a id="p-386"></a>

- POc _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ ‘go (away, to)’
- POc _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ ‘go (away)’
- POc _&ast;ua_ ‘go towards addressee’
- POc _&ast;[y]aku_ ‘go, go away’

These are presented and their locomotion uses discussed below. The verbs _&ast;lako_ ([vol.2:258](ContributionTable?anchor=p-258#cldf:2-8), 269-270, 277-279) and _&ast;pano_ ([vol.2:279](ContributionTable?anchor=p-279#cldf:2-8)–280), also had short forms, _la_ and _pa_, and in a number of languages the short form displaced the long form altogether. A few languages—Gitua (NNG), Manam (NNG), Mota (NCV), Woleaian (Mic), Puluwatese (Mic)—have verbal reflexes of a long and a short form side by side.

Where a form reflecting _&ast;lako_ or _&ast;laka_ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).3 below) has lost its final vowel, it can be difficult to know which verb it reflects. Tuam _-laɣ_ and Kaiep _-lak_ are assumed to be cognate with Gitua _-laɣo_ and Manam/Wogeo _-lako_ respectively, and Sursurunga _lək-lək_ is taken to reflect _&ast;lako_ because the root _lək(ə)_ occurs in the compound _ləkə(m)_ ‘come’, reflecting _&ast;lako_ + _&ast;mai_, a combination occurring in other MM languages.

[PMP &ast;_lakaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-386-POc-lako-a)


<a id="p-387"></a>

The long vowel in ’Are’are and Oroha _rā_ below probably reflects a preference for bimoraic roots.[^10] However, Andrew Pawley (pers. comm.) suggests that perhaps all forms reflecting _ &ast;la_ are bimoraic, but that length is not represented in their orthographies. If this is so, then the POc form should also be reconstructed as bimoraic, i.e. _&ast;lā_.

The forms listed below under ‘cf. also’ appear to reflect a POc form _&ast;lae_, but it is not clear how this might have differed from _&ast;la_. It is possible that these forms represent independent developments (perhaps associated with bimoraicity preference), the more so as the sequence _&ast;-ae_ is not otherwise found in reconstructed POc.

In the short-form set below Loniu (Adm) _-lɛ_, Titan (Adm) _-le_, both ‘go to’, and Lonwolwol (NCV) _-le_ ‘leave (a place)’, reflect coalescence either of _&ast;la_ + transitive suffix _&ast;-i_ or possibly of _&ast;la_ + locative preposition&ast;i.

[PMP &ast;_lakaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-387-POc-la-a)


<a id="p-388"></a>

There was evidently a difference in usage between POc _&ast;lako_ ‘go (to)’ and POc _&ast;pano_ ‘go (away)’. As noted in [vol.2(279](ContributionTable?anchor=p-279#cldf:2-8)), many verbal reflexes of _&ast;lako_ have a valency which implies or requires a destination (expressed, for example, as a prepositional phrase), whilst those of _&ast;pano_ are intransitive.

A few reflexes of POc _&ast;pano_ indicate that it was also a geographic directional verb meaning ‘move in a transverse direction’, contrasting with ‘go up, go inland’ and ‘go down, go seawards’. This is discussed in [vol.2(279](ContributionTable?anchor=p-279#cldf:2-8)).


<a id="p-389"></a>

[PMP &ast;_panaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-390-POc-pa-a)

A small number of forms from Schouten (NNG) and Reefs/Santa Cruz (TM) languages and one from Sobei (SJ) are listed below. It would be easy to attribute them to POc _&ast;pa_ above, but in all instances except Medebur initial _w-_ reflects _&ast;w-_ or _&ast;u-_. They evidently reflect the POc deictic directional verb _&ast;ua_ ‘go towards addressee’ ([vol.2:273](ContributionTable?anchor=p-273#cldf:2-8)–274). There is no other evidence to suggest that POc _&ast;ua_ functioned as a locomotion verb, and its extended use as a verb of locomotion may have developed separately on the north coast of New Guinea and in the Reefs/Santa Cruz languages.

<a id="p-391"></a>

The medial consonant of POc _&ast;[y]aku_ ‘go, go away’ is reconstructed on the basis of Yabem low tone, which reflects the loss of a Proto Huon Gulf voiced obstruent, probably either _&ast;v_ or _&ast;ɣ_, lenis reflexes of POc _&ast;p_ or _&ast;k_. Of these, both are lost intervocalically in Takia, but only _&ast;k_ is lost in the Admiralties languages.

[POc &ast;_&#91;y&#93;aku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-391-POc-yaku-a)

Only a few reflexes of POc _&ast;oRo_ ‘come, go’ have been found outside Polynesia. The glosses of its reflexes indicate that it was not a deictic directional verb, but it is otherwise difficult to further specify its meaning.

[POc &ast;_oRo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-391-POc-oro-a)

Just as it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between reflexes of _&ast;lako_ (above) and _&ast;laka_ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).3), so it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between reflexes of _&ast;pano_ (above) and _&ast;pana_ (below). Languages as far apart phylogenetically as Vitu and Māori have reflexes of both forms, indicating that both occurred in POc, but there are few languages reflecting both and it is difficult to be sure what the POc meaning contrast was.


<a id="p-392"></a>

Blust (ACD) notes that, ‘In many languages reflexes of this form [_&ast;pana_] are indistinguishable from reflexes of the far more common PAn _&ast;paNaw_, POc _&ast;pano_ ‘go away, depart, leave on a journey’. Label han is assumed to reflect POc _&ast;pana_ rather than &ast;pano since its closest relatives which have preserved the final vowel point to _&ast;-a_.’ The same assumption is made here regarding other New Ireland reflexes, except for those with reduplicated versions that mean ‘walk’. These are attributed to _&ast;pano_ (see POc (?) _&ast;pa(no)_-pano ‘walk’ in [§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).3), but this decision may be mistaken.

<a id="s-3-1-2"></a>

#### 3.1.2. Move from one location to another


POc _&ast;(ali)ali_ ‘move from one location to another’ was inherited from PMP. In Vanuatu excluding the Banks and Torres Islands in the north, it has undergone a semantic shift to mean ‘walk’.

[PMP &ast;_aliq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-392-POc-aliali-a)


<a id="p-393"></a>


<a id="s-3-1-3"></a>

#### 3.1.3. Walk, step, stride


It is difficult to distinguish between the meanings of _&ast;lako_/_&ast;la_ and _&ast;pano_/_&ast;pa_ ‘go on foot’ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).1) and of the terms in the present section, but the terms below each perhaps denote the specific action of walking as opposed to generic going on foot.

Two POc terms meaning ‘go, walk’, _&ast;raka(t)_ and _&ast;laka_, are formally similar to POc _&ast;lako_ ‘go (away, to), walk’ above. Where the nucleus of the second syllable reflects _&ast;-o_ or _&ast;-a_, the distinction between _&ast;lako_ and _&ast;raka(t)_/_&ast;laka_ is straightforward. The attribution to _&ast;lako_ of reflexes that have lost the final vowel is briefly explained in [§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).1. Where a verb reflects the short form _&ast;la_, it is taken to reflect _&ast;lako_.

It is more difficult, however, to distinguish between reflexes of POc _&ast;raka(t)_ ‘go, walk’ and of POc _&ast;laka_ ‘go, walk’ in languages that have merged POc _&ast;r_ and _&ast;l_, but terms that have the sense of stepping over something are attributed to _&ast;laka_. This motivates the attribution of PPn _&ast;laka_ ‘step, march; pass, cross over’ and its many reflexes to _&ast;laka_ rather than to _&ast;raka(t)_, although phonologically they could reflect either. It seems likely that reflexes of the two terms were conflated in some languages. The PMP ancestors of POc _&ast;raka(t)_ and _&ast;laka_ are respectively _&ast;rakat_ and _&ast;la(ŋ)kaq_, but transitive Wayan (Fij) _lakat-i_ reflects _&ast;l-_ (not _&ast;r-_) but _&ast;-t_ (not _&ast;-q_), pointing to a hybrid _&ast;lakat_.

Lihir merges _&ast;r_ and _&ast;l_ as _l_, but on semantic grounds Lihir _laka(n)_, listed under ‘cf. also’, probably reflects _&ast;raka(t)_ rather than _&ast;laka_. Other items listed under _&ast;raka(t)_ have an unambiguous initial consonant.

[PAn &ast;_rakat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-393-POc-rakat-a)

Motu has dozens of compounds denoting manners of walking, e.g. _raka-edea_ ‘walk alone’, _raka-hanai_ ‘walk past’, _raka-hekapu_ ‘walk side by side’, _raka-muri_ ‘walk backwards’, _raka-roho_ ‘stride along’, _raka-kahira_ ‘draw near’, and _raka-kava_ ‘walk aimlessly’. Its Sinaugoro cognate behaves similarly: _raka-rosi_ ‘go outside’, _raka-vesiri_ ‘go away’, _raka-ɣeɣeraɣi-ɣeɣeraɣi_ ‘go from place to place’.

[PMP &ast;_la(ŋ)kaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-394-POc-laka-a)

A reduplicated reflex of POc _&ast;pano_ ‘go (away)’, (?) ‘move in a transverse direction’ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).1) means ‘walk’ in a number of languages with a discontinuous distribution including some MM languages of New Ireland, some SES languages, and a number of northern Vanuatu languages. The reduplicated form is tentatively attributed to POc.


<a id="p-395"></a>

[POc &ast;_pa(no)-pano_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-395-POc-panopano-a)

At first sight POc _&ast;pajale_ ‘walk about, take a walk’ looks suspiciously like the root _&ast;jalan_ ‘path’, preceded by the causative prefix _&ast;pa-_. However, this would give rise to Lavongai †_asalen_ (_salen_ ‘path’) and Tigak †_asalan_ (_salan_ ‘path’) instead of _pasal_ in both languages.

<a id="s-3-1-4"></a>

#### 3.1.4. Move quickly, hurry, run


Terms in this area of meaning are difficult to reconstruct, as lexical replacement seems to have been frequent. For this probable reason reflexes of the reconstructed etyma have spotty distributions.


<a id="p-396"></a>

POc _&ast;(i,a)ropu_ ‘run’ bears a superficial resemblance to POc _&ast;Ropok_ ‘fly’ ([§6.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-2#cldf:5-6).1), and indeed some terms meaning ‘run’ reflect the latter (e.g. Longgu [SES] _lovo-lovo_ ‘run quickly’, a reduplicated form of lovo ‘fly’). The terms listed below, however, reflect POc _&ast;r-_, as reflexes of _&ast;r_ and _&ast;R_ are distinct in Admiralties languages. Furthermore, terms for ‘fly’ reflecting _&ast;Ropok_—Mussau _loo_, Titan _yo_, Misima _you_—are different from those reflecting _&ast;(i,a)ropu_ ‘run’.

[POc &ast;_(i,a)ropu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-1-396-POc-iaropu-a)

The cognate set supporting POc _&ast;joŋas_ ‘move quickly’ entails two small phonological difficulties. First, the non-Micronesian reflexes reflect POc _&ast;j-_, but [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) reconstruct PMic _&ast;caŋa_. PMic _&ast;c-_ regularly reflects POc _&ast;d_ or _&ast;dr_. However, Kiribati _r-_ reflects POc _&ast;d_, _&ast;dr_ or _&ast;j-_, and the most economic assumption is that Ponapean _t-_ and Chuukese _c̣-_ reflect an irregular intra-Micronesian sound change. Second, evidence as to the first vowel is conflicting. Admiralties and NNG languages reflect _-o-_, MM and Micronesian languages _-a-_. I have assumed here that the protovowel was _&ast;-o-_ and that _-a-_ is the result of assimilation.

<a id="s-3-1-5"></a>

#### 3.1.5. Crawl, creep


Two POc terms for ‘crawl, creep’ can be reconstructed. The term with the most widely distributed reflexes is POc _&ast;kaRaka_ ‘crawl on all fours’. Less widely distributed, with only one non-WOc reflex is POc _&ast;(d,dr)aRaC_ ‘crawl (along the ground)’ below.

PCP _&ast;dolo_ ‘crawl (along the ground)’ bears a vague formal similarity to POc _&ast;(d,dr)aRaC_ above, but in fact only their initial consonants correspond and they are not related.

#### 3.1.6. Limp, hop


The senses of reflexes of POc _&ast;tige_ vary between ‘hop on one leg’, ‘limp’ and ‘walk on tiptoe’. Iduna _sike_ and Longgu _tike_ occur where respectively †_ɣige_ and †_ige_ would be the regular reflexes and are evidently loans. PPn &ast;_teki_ reflects vowel metathesis.

<a id="s-3-1-7"></a>

#### 3.1.7. Roll


This subsection concerns ‘roll’ as an intransitive locomotion verb expressing the manner in which its subject moves, e.g. ‘The stone rolled down the hill.’ At first sight, the items in the three sets below seem to form a single cognate set, but closer examination shows that they reflect three different POc etyma. The first, _&ast;buliŋ_ (VI) ‘roll’, was intransitive (or just possibly ambitransitive, i.e. used both transitively and intransitively). The other two, &ast;(p,pʷ)uluk-i- (VT) ‘roll’ and &ast;(p,pʷ)uri- (VT) ‘roll’, were transitive, and intransitive forms meaning ‘roll’ in its locomotion sense were formed with the spontaneity prefix _&ast;ta-_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-6).4). Drehet _ta-pulu-i_ and Samoan _ta-fuli_ (VI) reflect POc _&ast;ta-_, while Bariai _ma-pul_ reflects POc _&ast;ma-_. These prefixes are described by [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):268–271, 279–284), who notes that both were only semi-productive in POc, both were valency-decreasing, removing the agent, while _&ast;ta-_ also emphasised the spontaneity of the event (2003:300).

#### 3.1.8. Climb


‘Climb’ has two main senses in English: ‘go up’ and ‘propel oneself up or down (a tree, a cliff etc)’. The first of these senses is a verb of direction, and its POc equivalent is _&ast;sake_, reconstructed in [vol.2(263](ContributionTable?anchor=p-263#cldf:2-8)-264). The sense intended here is the second, although the glosses below suggest that its meaning was readily extended to include the first sense. The POc verb is &ast;panaik, and one of the activities it denoted was one that is still readily seen in Melanesian villages, nicely defined in [Ivens’](Source#cldf:Ivens1918) ([1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918)) dictionary definition: ‘climb trees … with a rope round the feet, ascending by alternate jumps of hands and feet’.

Blust (ACD) reconstructs _&ast;panek_, as supported by his data. POc _&ast;panaik_ is reconstructed here to take account of Lukep _painak_, which appears to reflect metathesis of the two syllable nuclei.

<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Locomotion in the air


There are far fewer terms for locomotion in the air than for on land or in/on water simply because human beings in traditional societies do not engage in aerial locomotion. The two main meanings associated with movement through the air are ‘fly’ and ‘fall’.


<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Fly


The most widespread cognate set for ‘fly’ reflects POc _&ast;Ropok_. It is not found, however, in Micronesian or in this meaning in Central Pacific languages. Reflexes exist in Polynesian but with changed meaning (PPn _&ast;ofo_ ‘be startled, wake up’; [§4.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-4#cldf:5-6)) In Micronesian languages _&ast;Ropok_ is replaced by various terms. In Eastern Fijian we find Bauan _vuka_, Boumaa _vuʔa_, in Western Fijian Wayan _ðavu_, whilst the PPn term was _&ast;lele_ (see below). The Fijian terms listed under ‘cf. also’ look at first sight like reflexes of _&ast;Ropok_, but are not, as the expected reflex is †_ovo_.

It is interesting that some reflexes of POc _&ast;Ropok_ and PPn _&ast;rere_ taken from sources that provide more detailed definitions are glossed not only as ‘fly’ but also as ‘jump’, implying perhaps that the core meaning of the POc and PPn terms was something like ‘move through the air without touching the ground’.

<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Fall (from a height)


The English term ‘fall’ is polysemous, and only the locomotion sense ‘fall from a height’ is considered here. As [Zlatev & Yangklang](Source#cldf:ZlatevandYangklang2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:ZlatevandYangklang2004)) point out in relation to serial verb constructions in Thai, ‘fall’ is not strictly a verb of locomotion, but rather a path verb, i.e. a verb of geographic direction. What is more, unlike most locomotion verbs it is not agentive. These facts perhaps provide a clue as to why no Oceanic-wide cognate set for ‘fall’ is found: a number of languages instead use their geographic direction verb ‘go down’ for ‘fall’, thus treating ‘go down’ as unmarked for agentivity.

The most widely reflected form in the data is POc _&ast;(p,pʷ)u(k,kʷ)a_ ‘fall’. Under ‘cf. also’ are listed a number of WOc items that reflect the appropriate consonants but lack the ‘right’ vowels. This is a conundrum that awaits explanation.

<a id="p-403"></a>

In support of the PMP monosyllabic root _&ast;-buq_ ‘fall’, Blust (ACD) cites Yamdena (CMP) _fu-fu_ ‘fall from a height’ and Arosi ahu below. With the NNG items these imply the possibility of POc _&ast;(a)pu_.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Locomotion in and on water


In a study of verbs used in various languages for locomotion in and on water Lander, Maisak & Rahilina (2012) divide this semantic domain into three semantic subdomains: (a) swimming (self-propelled motion of an animate being); (b) floating (uncontrolled and non-agentive motion); and (c) sailing (motion of vessels and of the people aboard). Some languages (e.g. English) have verbs for each of these domains and little more. Others elaborate the subdomains. For example, Indonesian elaborates (c) with many verbs formed from nouns denoting vessels or areas of water. Others, on the other hand, conflate the three subdomains, like Russian, where _plyt’_/_plavat’_ is a verb denoting locomotion in and on water in general.

Given that the speakers of POc were skilful sailors, in many cases long-distance sailors, one might expect POc to have been like Indonesian. Indeed, perhaps it was, but the available data do not allow reconstruction of an elaborate set of terms for (c). Only POc _&ast;palau(r)_ ‘go to sea, make a sea voyage’ is reconstructable ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-6).1). This may be because relevant terms in modern languages have been lost with the demise of the ocean-going canoe, or simply because researchers have not been conscious of the need to collect such terms. POc terms can be reconstructed for the three subdomains proposed by Lander et al., but not for much more. There was also a verb for ‘wade’ ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-6).2), a concept not included in their analysis. There are two reconstructions for ‘swim’ ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-6).3) and one for ‘go under water’ ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-6).4). The ‘swim’ terms presumably differed in meaning in some now irretrievable way. Modern languages often distinguish between swimming on the surface and swimming under the surface. There were also terms for ‘float’ ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-6).5). Thus if one is to believe the testimony of the reconstructions presented in this section, POc was like English in its lexicalisation of locomotion in and on water, but this may well be an artefact of data collection and/or modernisation.


<a id="s-3-3-1"></a>

#### 3.3.1. Travel by sea


No term for a locomotion verb ‘sail’ is reconstructable. POc _&ast;palau(r)_ meant ‘go to sea, make a sea voyage’, and is derived from PMP _&ast;lahud_/POc _&ast;laur_ ‘sea, seawards’ ([vol.2:91](ContributionTable?anchor=p-91#cldf:2-4)–92).

<a id="p-404"></a>


<a id="s-3-3-2"></a>

#### 3.3.2. Wade


POc had a term for wading, i.e. for walking through water deep enough to impede free movement, namely _&ast;tuRu(p)_. Blust (ACD) is uncertain whether the medial consonant is _&ast;R_, but this is confirmed by the Baluan reflex. He suggests on the basis of SES transitive reflexes that the POc form may have ended in _&ast;-p_. The latter is parenthesised here as we so far have evidence of it only in SES languages.

<a id="p-405"></a>


<a id="s-3-3-3"></a>

#### 3.3.3. Swim


Four POc terms possibly meaning ‘swim’ are reconstructable, namely _&ast;kaRu_ and _&ast;qasa_, both ‘swim’, _&ast;loso_ ‘bathe, swim’ and _&ast;kʷaya_ ‘immerse self, swim’. It is reasonable to infer that their meanings differed, but, because there is a tendency for reflexes to shift meaning, the protoglosses are inevitably tentative. A major distinction that was evidently made is that between swimming as a physical activity entailing movement of arms and legs, and immersing oneself in water, typically with the intention of washing one’s body. The first two verbs, _&ast;kaRu_ and _&ast;qasa_ appear to have denoted the physical activity of swimming by moving arms and legs, whereas _&ast;loso_ and _&ast;kʷaya_ apparently denoted immersion. Hence _&ast;kaRu_ and _&ast;qasa_ were locomotion verbs, and their cognate sets are listed below. POc _&ast;loso_ and _&ast;kʷaya_, on the other hand, denoted a physical activity other than locomotion and appear in chapter 7.

[POc &ast;_qasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-3-3-406-POc-qasa-a)

Also reconstructable is PEOc _&ast;olo_ ‘swim’. A possible WOc cognate is Teop (MM) _oro_ ‘drift, float, be carried by the current’.

<a id="s-3-3-4"></a>

#### 3.3.4. Dive, go under water


Although most Oceanic languages have verbs that denote various kinds of diving as a human physical activity, the data do not allow POc reconstructions to be made for these meanings. The directional aspect of diving is often indicated by one of the geographic verbs for ‘go down’, POc _&ast;sipo_ and _&ast;sobu_, reconstructed in [vol.2:261](ContributionTable?anchor=p-261#cldf:2-8)-262. Nonetheless, one of the meanings of POc _&ast;ruku_ was ‘go under water’.

<a id="s-3-3-5"></a>

#### 3.3.5. Float, drift


Two POc terms meaning ‘float, drift’ can be reconstructed, but it is debatable whether either of them was a locomotion verb. POc _&ast;ma-qañur_ ‘floating, adrift’ is a promising candidate, as its Seimat and Arosi reflexes have glosses that imply movement. POc _&ast;saliR_ ‘flow, of water’ denoted movement of water, but the glosses of some of its reflexes also denote the movement of an object floating on flowing water. Whether the latter sense is reconstructable to POc is unclear. NCV reflexes do mean ‘float’, but the unexpected final vowel of PNCV _&ast;sale_ calls into question its descent from POc _&ast;saliR_. PWOc _&ast;pʷati_ ‘float, drift, be carried on water’ does seem to have denoted movement, but no EOc reflexes have been found.

## 4. Direction verbs


A section with this title also occurs in [vol.2(256](ContributionTable?anchor=p-256#cldf:2-8)-282). It presents reconstructions of the semantically most basic verbs of geographic direction, i.e. _&ast;sipo_, _&ast;sobu_ and _&ast;[s,j]u[(a,u)]_ ‘go downward’, _&ast;sake_ ‘go upward’, _&ast;surup_ ‘enter, penetrate’, and of deictic direction, i.e. _&ast;ma[i]_ ‘come (towards speaker)’, _&ast;ua_/_&ast;watu_ ‘towards addressee, _&ast;la[ko]_, _&ast;pa[no]_ and _&ast;[y]aku_ ‘away from speaker’. The purpose of the present section is to offer reconstructions of verbs that are semantically more complex but have a directional semantic component.


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Return


Verbs of returning arguably encode both an element of geographic direction, in that there is a reversal of path direction, and an element of deixis, as movement is towards a goal identical with an earlier starting point of movement.

Three verbs of returning reflect a single PMP root _&ast;uliq_. Final _&ast;-iq_ is often raised to Oceanic _-e_. POc evidently had reflexes of both the plain root _&ast;uliq_ (POc _&ast;uli(q)_, _&ast;ule_) and of _&ast;um-uliq_ (POc _&ast;mule_), where PMP _&ast;um-_ is the marker of actor voice, present by default as the PMP verb was intransitive.

[PMP &ast;_uliq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-1-409-POc-uliq-a)

In serial verb constructions reflexes of POc &ast;mule are often treated as verbs of geographic direction, as in this Takia (NNG) example:

[5-6-4-1-409-14](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-4-1-409-14)


<a id="p-410"></a>

[PMP &ast;_um-uliq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-1-410-POc-mule-a)

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1983b) ([1983–84b](Source#cldf:Blust1983b):11–13) draws attention to an idiosyncratic innovation shared by CMP and Oceanic languages. This is the raising of PMP _&ast;u-_ to _&ast;o-_ giving a PCEMP variant _&ast;oliq_ ‘return’, reflected in Oceanic only in SES languages.

[PMP &ast;_uliq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-1-410-POc-oliq-a)


<a id="p-411"></a>

There are relatively few EOc reflexes of the terms reconstructed above, partly perhaps because their function had been taken over by reflexes of PEOc _&ast;poki_ ‘return’.

[PEOc &ast;_poki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-1-411-PEOc-poki-a)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Turn round



<a id="p-412"></a>

POc apparently had two homophonous verbs with the root _&ast;liu_, one glossed ‘turn aside, change direction’ (this section) and the other _&ast;liu_ ‘go beyond, pass, surpass’ ([§6.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4-3#cldf:5-6)). It is possible that both reflect PAn _&ast;liuS_, which Blust (ACD) glosses ‘circumambulate, circumvent’. However, its Formosan reflexes suggest that PAn _&ast;liuS_ formed both intransitive and transitive verbs meaning ‘turn around’,[^12] the sense inherited by POc. Whether PAn _&ast;liuS_ was also ancestral to PMP _&ast;liu_ ‘surpass, exceed’ is not clear.

In addition to POc _&ast;liu_ ‘turn aside, change direction’, a reduplicated _&ast;li-liu_ ‘turn around, go back’ is also reconstructable (the different glosses of POc _&ast;liu_ and _&ast;li-liu_ are tentative at best). Many reflexes of these two forms are similar in meaning to reflexes of the items in [§6.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4-1#cldf:5-6), but the overall pattern of their glosses suggests that _&ast;liu_ and _&ast;li-liu_ profiled the semantic element of turning around rather than simply of going back.

The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ below appear to reflect a POc _&ast;[ri]riu_ ‘turn’, i.e. a form in which _&ast;l_ had been replaced by _&ast;r_. This is not a regular sound change.

[POc &ast;_liu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-2-412-POc-liu-a)


<a id="p-413"></a>

PPn _&ast;ma-liu_ reflects the same root with the addition of the detransitivising prefix _&ast;ma-_ (see also the entries for Neve’ei and Naha’ai above).

[PAn &ast;_ma-liuS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-2-413-POc-maliu-a)


<a id="p-414"></a>

Three further POc terms meaning ‘turn round’ or ‘turn back’ are reconstructable. The first, _&ast;likot_, is reconstructed on the basis of evidence from western Malayo-Polynesian languages noted in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) and a single regular Oceanic reflex, Bali (MM) _liɣota_. The Vangunu reflex _likoso_ is irregular, as the expected form is †_liɣoto_.

[PMP &ast;_liget_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-2-414-POc-likot-a)

The other two reconstructions are formally similar, and it is hard to believe that they are not historically connected in some way, as both display the pattern &ast;LABIAL-_ulos_. They are:

- POc _&ast;[ta]bulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round, turn back’, _&ast;bulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn round, turn back’
- POc _&ast;pulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round’, _&ast;pulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’

However, there is no straightforward way to unify them.

The first, _&ast;[ta]bulo(s)_, _&ast;bulos-i-_, is internally consistent. Most of the intransitive forms reflect the semi-productive POc prefix _&ast;ta-_, which decreased valency by removing the agent, and emphasised the spontaneity of the event ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-6).4; [Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):300). However, in this instance, the prefix simply functions to reduce valency.

[POc &ast;_&#91;ta&#93;bulo(s)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-2-414-POc-tabulos-a)


<a id="p-415"></a>

POc _&ast;pulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round’, _&ast;pulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’ entails some formal challenges:

-    The presence of fortis _p-_ in Bulu, Harua, Roviana, W Guadalcanal, Talise and Birao, where
     a lenis reflex is expected, is probably explained by the fact that the sequence _&ast;pu-_
     sometimes gives rise to [&ast;pʷu], where [&ast;pʷ] resists lenition.
-    The sequence [&ast;pʷu] sometimes becomes [&ast;pʷi] in Oceanic languages, i.e. the rounding
     feature is fully transferred from [&ast;u] to preceding [&ast;pʷ], accounting for _-i-_, instead of †_-u-_,
     in W Guadalcanal, Talise, Birao and all NCV reflexes except Kiai.
-    The second vowel, _&ast;-o-_, is fronted to _-e-_ (or _-i-_ in Tabar and Neve’ei) in both intransitive
     and transitive forms. This is especially common in NCV reflexes, leading [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) to
     reconstruct two PNCV forms, _&ast;viles-i_ and _&ast;vilos-i_. There is no obvious explanation for
     this alternation, but it is very unlikely that †_&ast;pules-i-_ occurred in POc, as _&ast;e_ is usually
     stem-final, reflecting PMP _&ast;-ay_.

These considerations point to the reconstruction of POc _&ast;pulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round’, _&ast;pulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’, and also suggest that early Vanuatu Oceanic must also have retained the form _&ast;vulos-i_.

<a id="p-416"></a>

[PNCV &ast;_viles-i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-2-416-PNCV-vilesi-a)

The POc stems _&ast;bulos_ and _&ast;pulos_ which are central to the reconstructions above must have a common origin, but they are not related by any known morphological pattern.


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Go beyond, pass by, surpass


The formal identity of POc _&ast;liu_ ‘go beyond, pass, surpass’ and POc _&ast;liu_ ‘turn aside, change direction’ is discussed in the introduction to 6.4.2 above.

Grammaticisation of a verb meaning ‘surpass’—often a figurative extension of a verb meaning ‘go beyond, pass’—as a comparative marker is common in Oceanic languages, such that _My house is bigger than yours_ is expressed by a clause containing a serial verb construction with the sense ‘My house big surpasses yours.’ Such a use is noted in the ’Are’are and Arosi dictionary entries from which items below are drawn.

<a id="p-417"></a>


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Arrive, appear


Four POc verbs are reconstructed in this section: _&ast;potu_ ‘appear, come into view’, _&ast;pʷosa_ ‘appear’, _&ast;pura_ ‘arrive, appear’, _&ast;pʷaka_ ‘come into view’. They share similar clusters of meanings: ‘arrive’, ‘come into view’, ‘rise (especially of the moon)’ and ‘appear’. They are included here because reflexes of the most widely reflected of the four, _&ast;potu_, serve as direction verbs in serial verb constructions in at least the languages of southern New Ireland, as in this Ramoaaina (MM) example.

[5-6-4-4-417-15](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-4-4-417-15)

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) notes that in north and central Vanuatu languages reflexes of _&ast;potu_ are used of the emergence of the new moon: e.g. Mota _o vula we wot ma_ ‘a new moon appears’, and occur as an attribute in the phrase ‘new moon’: e.g. Nokuku _wul wotu_ ‘new moon’, Tamambo _vitu-votu_ ‘new moon’, Rerep _nebur mi uet_ ‘new moon’.

[PMP &ast;_betu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-4-417-POc-potu-a)


<a id="p-418"></a>

The other three verbs are less widely reflected and their usage is less well understood than that of _&ast;potu_.

[POc &ast;_pʷosa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-4-418-POc-posa-a)

[POc &ast;_pura_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-4-4-418-POc-pura-a)

The presentation of POc _&ast;pʷaka_ ‘come into view’ below retains [Bender et al.’s](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) presentation of Micronesian data supporting PMic _&ast;pʷax(a,e)_ but separates off under ‘cf. also’ the transitive reflexes they list meaning ‘show’ or ‘announce’. This is done to highlight a difficulty in Bender et al.’s analysis. They reconstruct PMic medial _&ast;-x-_ (< POc _&ast;g_) on the basis of the seemingly regular sound correspondence Kosraean _-k_, Ponapean, Mokilese and Pingelapese _-r_ and Chuukese, Puluwatese, Carolinian and Woleaian zero ([Bender et al. 2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003):4). This is achieved by segmenting the transitives as Chuukese _pʷǣ-ri_ etc. But if, as is usual, the consonant preceding the transitive suffix _-i_ belongs to the PMic root (Chuukese _pʷǣr-i_ etc.), then Chuukese, Puluwatese, Carolinian and Woleaian have _-r_ in this position, and all items except Kosraean reflect PMic _&ast;pʷar(a,e)_, not PMic _&ast;pʷax(a,e)_. If this reinterpretation is correct, then it is possible that all Micronesian items other than Kosraean reflect POc _&ast;pura_ above, rather than POc _&ast;pʷaka_.

<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Gather, congregate


A POc verb of the form _&ast;so(k,g)o(n)_ is reconstructable with a meaning that has to do with gathering or assembly, but both its form and its semantics are problematic. The Mussau, Mota and Paamese reflexes point to medial _&ast;-k-_, the Lonwolwol and Wayan reflexes to _&ast;-g-_ (and Nguna to _&ast;-ŋ-_). The glosses make it difficult to determine which form is intransitive, which transitive. On formal grounds, _&ast;so(k,g)o(n)_ was presumably intransitive, _&ast;so(k,g)on-i_ transitive, but the Nguna and Wayan Fijian use of _&ast;so(k,g)on-i_ as intransitive render this a little uncertain.

[POc &ast;_so(k,g)o(n)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-5-2-420-POc-sokgon-a)

Two POc locative nouns _&ast;muri-_ ‘rear, back part’ and &ast;muqa- ‘front’, along with PWOc _&ast;muga_, a variant form of _&ast;muqa_, are reconstructed in [vol.2(247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8)–249, 251-252). It is noted there that _&ast;muqa_/_&ast;muga_ and _&ast;muri_ both also occurred as verbs, respectively meaning ‘be in front’ and ‘be behind, be after’. Only verbal reflexes are listed below.

## 6. Caused movement verbs


Caused movement refers to an event where an agent, usually a person, causes a theme (the person or thing that is moved) to move. The semantic frame of caused movement is rather complex. It involves

- an agent (who/which moves the theme)
- a theme (what is moved)
- a source (the location the theme is moved from)
- a goal (the location the theme is moved to)
- the movement event itself

Thus in an English sentence like

|       |         |           |                  |                 |
|:------|:--------|:----------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| _She_ | _moved_ | _the pot_ | _from the table_ | _to the ground_ |
| AGENT | EVENT   | THEME     | SOURCE           | GOAL            |

all five frame elements are profiled.[^15] Caused movement constructions differ as to whether these elements are all profiled. In this construction the source and the goal are each optional. In construction with, say, put (instead of moved), the goal is obligatory and for many English-speakers the source is obligatorily absent.

Crucially, however, the verb itself may also profile certain frame elements. Predictably some caused movement verbs profile elements associated with posture and movement verbs, discussed in earlier sections. These include:

 4. the resulting posture of the theme (cf [§6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:5-6)): transitive sit/seat/set, stand, lay, hang
 5. locomotion (cf [§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-6)), i.e. the manner of movement of the theme: drop (‘let fall, cause to
    fall’), send (‘cause to go’), throw (‘cause to fly’), transitive roll
 6. the direction of vertical movement ([§6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4#cldf:5-6)): lift, raise (‘cause to go up’), lower, drop
    (‘cause to go down’)
 7. the path of movement ([§6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4#cldf:5-6))): insert (‘cause to go into’), extract (‘cause to come out of’),
    immerse (‘cause to go into water’), box (‘cause to be in boxes’)
 8. Other frame elements profiled by caused movement verbs relate to human causal agency:
 9. whether or not the agent accompanies the theme in its movement:[^16]
 10. not specified, with take, push and pull
     a. yes, with carrying verbs like carry, bring, drag
     b. if no, then whether or not some part or tool of the agent touches the theme until it reaches its goal
        i. yes, with putting verbs like put, insert, immerse
        ii. no, with sending verbs like send, drop, throw
        iii. the kind of force that the agent applies in order to move the theme: push, pull,
             drag, throw
 11. change of possession: give, present, distribute, receive, exchange, steal


<a id="p-423"></a>

The elements listed above are not mutually exclusive. Some of the English verbs given as examples occur more than once because their meaning potentially profiles more than one element. Because of this, verbs can be somewhat arbitrarily categorised in various ways. The organisation below is an attempt to categorise verbs by meaning in a way that is appropriate to Oceanic languages. A primary three-way division is based on item 9 which distinguishes among the following: a few verbs like take, push and pull where the agent may or may not accompany the theme in its movement (9a); carrying verbs, quite numerous in Oceanic languages (9b); and verbs of putting and sending (9c). Explanations of lower-order categories are distributed through the sections below, which are arranged as follows:

- [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6). Simple caused movement:
  - [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).1. Taking (9a)
  - [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).2. Verbs that profile vertical direction: raising and lowering (3)
  - [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).3. Force-profiling verbs: pushing and pulling (9a, iii)
- [§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6). Accompanied caused movement (9a):
  - [§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).1–12. Carrying verbs that profile the physical relationship between agent and theme
  - [§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).13. Dragging
- [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6). Unaccompanied caused movement:
  - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1. Putting (9c-i)
    - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.1. Simple putting
    - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.2. Putting verbs that profile the resulting posture of the theme (1)
    - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.3. Putting verbs that profile the path of movement (4)
    - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.4. ‘Putting’ in reverse: taking
  - [§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).2. Sending (9c-ii)

The verbs reconstructed in the sections below consist of a root or, in the case of transitives formed from a root ending in _-a_ or a consonant, of root + _&ast;-i_. POc evidently had two morphological means of forming a caused movement verb from a locomotion ([§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-6)) or direction verb ([§6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4#cldf:5-6)). One was to prefix it with the causative derivational prefix _&ast;pa-_, a process reflected in this Kwaio (SES) example:

Kwaio _oli_ ‘return, come back to’ >      _faʔa-oli-_ ‘cause to return, send back’


<a id="p-424"></a>

The other was to add the applicative suffix _&ast;-akin[i]_. Semantically this had two functions, as [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):203) notes. In the first it produced a verb like those formed with _&ast;pa-_, in which the agent causes the theme to perform the action denoted by the root, as in

|          |                     |     |                                        |
|:---------|:--------------------|:----|:---------------------------------------|
| Manam    | _gege_ (VI) ‘roll’  | >   | _gege-ak_ (VT) ‘roll’                  |
|          | _alale_ (VI) ‘walk’ | >   | _alale-ak_ (VT) ‘help s.o. walk’       |
| NE Ambae | _saga_ ‘go on top’  | >   | _sagat-agi[ni]_ ‘put s.t. on top’      |
| Bauan    | _ðuru_ ‘enter’      | >   | _ðurum-aki_ ‘insert s.t.’              |
|          | _dromu_ ‘sink’      | >   | _dromuð-aki_ ‘push s.t. under (water), |

In the typology above, these are simple or unaccompanied caused movement verbs.

In the second function _&ast;-akin[i]_ formed a verb in which the agent performs the action denoted by the root, and the theme is a concomitant:

|          |                  |     |                                                   |
|:---------|:-----------------|:----|:--------------------------------------------------|
| NE Ambae | _toa_ ‘run’      | >   | _toa-gi[ni]_ ‘run off with s.t.’                  |
|          | _hivo_ ‘go down’ | >   | _hivo-gi[ni]_ ‘go down with s.t., take s.t. down’ |
|          | _vano_ ‘go’      | >   | _vano-gi[ni]_ ‘go with s.t., take s.t.’           |
| Bauan    | _ðiði_ ‘run’     | >   | _ðiðiv-aki_ ‘run off with s.t.’                   |
|          | _galo_ ‘swim’    | >   | _galov-aki_ ‘swim with s.t.’                      |

Such verbs are verbs of accompanied caused movement, resembling verbs of carrying. However, in a carrying verb it is the physical relationship between the agent and the theme that is profiled. In an _&ast;-akin[i]_ verb it is the manner or direction of the agent’s movement that is profiled.

Verbs formed with _&ast;pa-_ and _&ast;-akin[i]_ are not considered further here, because we cannot be sure which derived verbs occurred in POc. But we can be sure that the morphosemantic processes reflected in these examples occurred in POc. The functions of _&ast;pa-_ have been widely discussed in the literature, and [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):195, 203) shows that the two functions of _&ast;-akin[i]_ mentioned here are reflected so widely that they must be reconstructed for POc.

### 6.1. Simple caused movement


The word ‘simple’ is used here of verbs that are unspecified for a certain frame element. Verbs of taking ([§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).1) and the force-profiling verbs of pushing and pulling ([§6.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-1-2#cldf:5-6)) are unspecified for item 9 in the list above. That is, they sometimes denote accompanied caused movement, sometimes unaccompanied. In the case of verbs of pushing and pulling, this is rather obvious: one can push a cart along a street (accompanied caused movement) or push a pot over (unaccompanied caused movement). In the case of ‘take’, the lack of specification is less obvious, and is explained in the following section.


<a id="s-6-1-1"></a>

#### 6.1.1. Taking


Simple verbs of caused movement are often glossed as ‘get’, ‘take’ or ‘bring’. They are used in constructions that also profile the source, e.g. ‘he took the knife from the table’, and in constructions that only profile the caused movement, e.g. ‘he took/brought my knife’.


<a id="p-425"></a>

English _take_ occurs in dozens of idiomatic phrases (_take heart_, _take hold_, _take a sip_, _take a break_, _take over_, etc), but its core meaning involves accompanied movement by an agent of something (the theme) from one location to another. Either the source location or the goal location may be profiled, as for instance, in ‘take it off the ground’ and ‘take it to its mother’. In this respect Oceanic languages are similar to English. The Vitu (MM) verb _pele-_ is used with a source in this example. The source is ‘her betelnut basket’.

[5-6-6-1-425-16](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-425-16)

However, English _take_ also profiles direction away from the deictic centre, contrasting with bring, which profiles direction towards it. Oceanic languages, however, encode this deictic contrast with a deictic direction verb—or a deictic morpheme derived from a verb ([vol.2:273](ContributionTable?anchor=p-273#cldf:2-8)-282)—in the last slot of a serial verb construction, as in these Vitu (MM) examples.

[5-6-6-1-425-17](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-425-17)

[5-6-6-1-425-18](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-425-18)

This leaves _pele-_ profiling only the means of movement, namely that the agent moves the theme, i.e. simple caused movement. The verb _pele-_ is the same in all three examples. This is a typical Oceanic configuration, such that one caused movement verb corresponds to both English _take_ and _bring_. A practical result of this is that these Oceanic verbs are often glossed as one or more of ‘take’, ‘get’ and ‘bring’, but the verbs have the same functions whichever of these glosses is used. Thus the verbs reconstructed here overlap two semantic domains. The first is ‘reverse putting’, e.g. ‘taking off the table’ as opposed to ‘putting on the table’ ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.4), a subdomain of unaccompanied caused movement. The other is carrying ([§6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:5-6)), a subdomain of accompanied caused movement.

A second semantic complication, discussed by [D’Jernes](Source#cldf:DJernes2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:DJernes2013)) with regard to Lukep (Pono) _-kaua_/_-kap_ ‘get, give’ (where the first form takes a singular object, the second a plural) is that a verb meaning ‘take, get’ in some languages also means ‘give’. In others, the ‘give’ verb is derived historically from a ‘take, get’ verb. This is less strange than it appears. If the basic meaning of these verbs is simply that the agent moves the theme, then the addition of a recipient is enough to narrow the movement to ‘giving’.[^17]

The verbs reconstructed below also raise formal challenges. Broadly, these are due to the fact that words of high token frequency may fail to undergo changes that would otherwise affect them. For example, the Lukep (Pono) pair mentioned above, _-kaua_ and _-kap_, are exceptional in encoding their object respectively as singular and plural. Lukep (Pono) has generally lost POc object indexing enclitics, but retains _-a_ 3SG on a small number of now ‘irregular’ verbs ([D’Jernes](Source#cldf:DJernes2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:DJernes2002)).


<a id="p-426"></a>

However, at least one such irregularity originated long before the emergence of POc. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn/PMP _&ast;alap_, PMP _&ast;alaq_ both ‘fetch, get, take’, and PAn _&ast;ala_ ‘take, get, fetch, obtain’. Their similarities of form and meaning indicate that they have a shared origin that cannot be reconstructed. PMP _&ast;alap_ and _&ast;alaq_ were both inherited into POc, but with a complication. The predicted POc transitive forms are _&ast;alap-i-_ and _&ast;alaq-i-_. The former is reflected in Gela and Tongan (immediately below). But more widely reflected are forms in which initial _&ast;a-_ has vanished, i.e. _&ast;lap-i-_ and _&ast;la(q)-i-_. The _&ast;a_-less forms evidently already occurred in POc, and for clarity’s sake are reconstructed separately below

[PAn/PMP &ast;_alap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-426-POc-alap-a)

<a id="p-427"></a>

[PMP &ast;_alaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-427-POc-laqi-a)

Three further verbs which, like those above, denote simple caused movement, are reconstructed below. The first, POc _&ast;pa_, is phonologically unusual in that its root is a monosyllabic CV form. Most POc roots are polysyllabic. The New Caledonian forms in this set are from [Ozanne-Rivierre](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre2004b) ([2004b](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre2004b)).

[POc &ast;_pa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-427-POc-pa-a)

[POc &ast;_ŋal(e,i)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-427-POc-alei-a)

The exact form of the reconstruction below is not entirely clear. Evidence for the phoneme following initial _&ast;ka-_ is conflicting. Seimat and Kilivila _kau_, Lukep (Pono) _-kau-a_, Patep _ko_, Sinaugoro _-ɣau_, Wayan Fijian _kau_ and Samoan _ʔau-mai_ support the reconstruction of POc _&ast;kʷau_. Other evidence points to a labial, but which labial is unclear. Tuam _ɣam_, Mangap _kam_, and Nehan _kaba_ support _&ast;kʷabV_, while a number of items indicate _&ast;kʷap_. There are two possible explanations here. One is that the cognate set reflects more than one POc morphological variant, just as Lukep (Pono) preserves two variants ([D’Jernes 2013](Source#cldf:DJernes2013)). The other is that this is not one cognate set but two, reflecting similar but separate POc forms. The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ complicate the picture, but appear to reflect a separate form _&ast;ka[-i-]_.


<a id="p-428"></a>

[POc &ast;_kʷau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-428-POc-kau-a)

Almost certainly related to the above is POc &ast;(k,kʷ)awe ‘carry, carry away’, but the relationship does not reflect a known derivational process.


<a id="p-429"></a>

<a id="s-6-1-2"></a>

#### 6.1.2. Raising and lowering


A verb for a certain kind of raising, POc _&ast;laŋa(t)_, _&ast;laŋat-i-_ ‘raise, pull up, lever up’, is reconstructable.

[POc &ast;_laŋa(t)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-429-POc-laat-a)

No verb of lowering can be reconstructed, but a number of languages form a verb ‘lower’ by attaching a reflex of the POc causative prefix _&ast;pa-_ to a verb meaning ‘be deep’ or ‘go down’. Examples include Bariai (NNG) _pa-sil_ from _sil_ ‘deep’, Sursurunga (MM) _a-sih-əi_ from _sih_ ‘go down’, To’aba’ita (SES) _faʔa-sifo-a_ from _sifo_ ‘go, move down, descend, more or less vertically’.


<a id="p-430"></a>


<a id="s-6-1-3"></a>

#### 6.1.3. Force-profiling verbs: pushing and pulling


Verbs of pushing and pulling profile the force that the agent exerts on the theme in order to move it. Whether the agent accompanies the theme along the path of movement is not part of the verb’s lexical meaning, but is conveyed by the construction in which the verb is used, e.g. They pulled the canoe up the beach (accompanied caused movement) vs He pulled the bag open (unaccompanied caused movement).


##### 6.1.3.1. Pushing


Oceanic languages tend to have a number of path-profiling verbs of pushing, e.g. ‘push open’, ‘push in’, ‘push through’, ‘push aside’, ‘push away’, ‘push under’, ‘push against’. None of these can be reconstructed from available data, but these ‘push’ terms from Lou (Adm), Lewo (NCV) and Sinaugoro (PT) give an indication of one reason for this.

| Lou (Adm)   |                         |
|:------------|:------------------------|
| _suek_      | ‘push’                  |
| _suer_      | ‘push ground’           |
| _susuer_    | ‘push ground with foot’ |
| _suput_     | ‘push away, make go’    |
| _susuŋ_     | ‘push clothes up’       |

| Lewo (NCV)   |                              |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------|
| _suponia_    | ‘push’                       |
| _suponipu_   | ‘push and turn s.t.’         |
| _supʷoni_    | ‘push, shove’                |
| _susuni_     | ‘move, push’                 |
| _suwani_     | ‘push into hole to block it’ |

Both the lists above, geographically separated as they are, consist of words with initial _su-_. The fact that so many ‘push’ verbs in each language begin with the same syllable cannot be coincidence, and probably tells us that these forms reflect earlier nuclear serial verb constructions, a productive construction in which two verbs formed a compound (Lou _suek_ ‘push’ is an exception: _-ek_ reflects the POc applicative suffix _&ast;-aki(n)_). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in Sinaugoro, such forms still are transparent compounds where the second element has its own lexical meaning (forms preceded by a hyphen in the third column always occur as the final part of a compound).


<a id="p-431"></a>

| Sinaugoro (PT)   |                           |         |           |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------|:--------|:----------|
| _dori_           | ‘push’                    |         |           |
| _dori-faka_      | ‘open by pushing’         | _faka_  | ‘between’ |
| _dori-ɣau_       | ‘close by pushing’        | _-ɣau_  | ‘cover’   |
| _dori-maraɣe_    | ‘push up’                 | _raɣe_  | ‘go up’   |
| _dori-riɣo_      | ‘push down’               | _riɣo_  | ‘go down’ |
| _dori-rosi_      | ‘push out’                | _-rosi_ | ‘out’     |
| _dori-tari_      | ‘push down on the ground’ | _-tari_ | ‘down’    |
| _dori-toɣa_      | ‘push inside’             | _-toɣa_ | ‘inside’  |

Sinaugoro _dori_ ‘push’ is not cognate with Lou or Lewo _su-_ but the latter are probably cognate with each other and probably reflect POc _&ast;qusur_ ‘push, shove’ with loss of the first syllable. Other Oceanic ‘push’ forms with initial _su(r)-_ are listed under ‘cf. also’.

[PMP &ast;_qunzur_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-1-431-POc-qusur-a)

A second POc term for ‘push’, _&ast;juju(n)_, _&ast;juni-_ ‘push’, is reconstructed below. There are some unanswered marginal queries about this reconstruction. It is reflected to my knowledge in only one non-WOc language, Lau, but Lau does not usually contain WOc loans, and is a reliable witness. Ughele and Marovo _juno-_ suggest a transitive form †_&ast;juno-_, but all other reflexes point to instantiation of the paradigm identified by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1977a) ([1977a](Source#cldf:Blust1977a)) ([vol.1:25](ContributionTable?anchor=p-25#cldf:1-2)), i.e. the forms as reconstructed.

##### 6.1.3.2. Pulling


There are a good many path-profiling ‘pull’ verbs in Oceanic languages. One, POc _&ast;pupu(t)_, _&ast;puti-_ ‘pick (fruit +), pluck (feathers +), pull out (weeds +)’, is widely reflected ([vol.1:277](ContributionTable?anchor=p-277#cldf:1-9)–278). An apparently simple verb of pulling, POc _&ast;Rape_ ‘pull, drag’, has quite widely distributed reflexes. POc _&ast;dradra_ ‘pull’ has just three known reflexes, all NNG, but non-Oceanic cognates support the POc reconstruction.

### 6.2. Accompanied caused movement


Verbs of accompanied caused movement are verbs of carrying and dragging. Many Oceanic languages have no default verb of carrying, but employ a number of carrying verbs, depending on how something/someone is carried and to a lesser degree on what is carried.[^18] Meanings that crop up with considerable frequency include

- carry on the head
- carry hanging from the head
- carry a child in a sling on the back
- carry on the shoulder
- carry hanging from shoulder
- carry piggyback
- carry with a shoulder pole
- carry on a long shoulder pole between two people
- carry under the arm (and on the hip)
- carry in both arms
- carry on a canoe

Of these, the first three modes listed are usually restricted to women, whilst carrying something on or hanging from the shoulder is typically a male mode. Hill (2015) remarks, ‘In the villages of Longgu district there is only one way to transport goods or children on land and that is for people to carry them. There are no animals used to carry loads, no bicycles, wheelbarrows or cars.’ This was true of all pre-contact Oceanic speaking communities and was true of communities speaking POc. Hill goes on to point out that while Longgu does not have a generic verb ‘carry’, it does have a verb _zabe_ ‘not carry anything’, ‘behavior that is considered either unusual or unacceptable’ in a community where every able-bodied person must contribute to the daily labour of the village.


<a id="p-434"></a>


<a id="s-6-2-1"></a>

#### 6.2.1. Carrying in general


POc, however, appears to have used _&ast;puat_ as a generic verb of carrying and transporting, although when the agent was male it apparently also could have the specific meaning ‘carry on the shoulder’. In its generic sense it probably overlapped with POc _&ast;kʷau_, _&ast;kʷap(i)_ ‘get, take’ ([§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).1), but the glosses in the cognate set below suggest that generic _&ast;puat_ profiled carrying or transporting a load, whereas _&ast;kʷau_, _&ast;kʷap(i)_ denoted carrying in a more general sense.

<a id="p-435"></a>


<a id="s-6-2-2"></a>

#### 6.2.2. Carrying on the head


The central meaning of POc _&ast;suqun_ was with reasonable certainty ‘carry on the head’, attested by non-Oceanic cognates from Taiwan to CMP (ACD). In Takia and Megiar the meaning has been extended to carrying in general. In NCV, as [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) recognises, the extension is to wearing on the head, then to wearing in general. That these terms are cognate is confirmed by the presence of the glottal stop in Namakir _hiʔin_, Namakir being the only NCV language regularly to reflect POc/PNCV _&ast;q_.

[PAn &ast;_suquL_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-2-435-POc-suqun-a)

PWOc _&ast;kud(r)u_ is also reconstructable as a term for carrying on the head. How this differed in meaning from POc _&ast;suqun_ is not clear, but the Mangap and Nakanai glosses below note that women carry burdens in this way, and it may be that _&ast;kud(r)u_ denoted a female carrying style.


<a id="p-436"></a>

#### 6.2.3. Carrying hanging from the head


When a woman from New Guinea carries a loaded netbag (_bilum_ in New Guinea Tok Pisin), she lets it hang down behind her resting on her back and she pulls its woven handle over her head to rest across her forehead so that the bag is suspended from it. Occasionally other loads are carried in this way too. Interestingly, no POc term for this mode of carrying can be reconstructed, and this matches the fact that no term for a netbag can be reconstructed either ([vol.1:79](ContributionTable?anchor=p-79#cldf:1-4)), apparently because the bilum was a New Guinea highland artefact that spread to the lowlands after the dispersal of Oceanic languages from NW Melanesia. This carrying mode has spread into the Solomon Islands, but is attested only at odd locations in the north of Vanuatu.

Some Admiralties and WOc terms for this carrying mode, along with one NCV term, look as if they are reflexes or borrowings of reflexes of PWOc _&ast;kud(r)u_ ‘carry on the head’ ([§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).2). Note that Tawala and Gapapaiwa _gedu_ share the replacement of _-u-_ by _-e-_ also found in Iduna _kedu_ above.

[5-6-6-2-436-adm-loniu-kun](cf.csv#cldf:5-6-6-2-436-adm-loniu-kun)


<a id="p-437"></a>

The most likely borrowing above is Poeng _kule_ as Poeng _-l-_ reflects POc _&ast;-r-_, _-R-_ or _-l-_ but not _&ast;-d(r)-_. Significantly Madden (n.d.) annotates this entry with a comment that Poeng speakers do not normally make or use bilums.


<a id="s-6-2-4"></a>

#### 6.2.4. Carrying piggyback


The main POc term for carrying someone piggyback (or pick-a-back, the older English form) is _&ast;pʷa(p,pʷ)a_, which is of PAn antiquity. Its exact POc form is uncertain, as the phonological evidence is conflicting. At the same time, the similarities in both form and meaning make it probable that these items form a cognate set. PMP _&ast;baba_ could regularly have become either POc _&ast;baba_ or _&ast;papa_. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) correctly observes that NCV items reflect either PNCV/ POc _&ast;baba_ or PNCV _&ast;bava_ (POc _&ast;bapa_). One might reconstruct alternant POc forms, but there is a solution which unites the apparently conflicting lines of evidence. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)) shows that PMP labials surface sporadically as POc labiovelars, and that the reflex of POc _&ast;pʷ_ in WOc languages is often a fortis _p_. The evidence below suggests that the initial POc consonant was indeed _&ast;pʷ_, an inference supported by the rounded vowels of Poeng _pope_ and Arosi _boha_. It is less clear whether the medial consonant was _&ast;-pʷ-_ or _&ast;-p-_, as some reflexes are fortis, others lenis.

There are also forms reflecting POc _&ast;papa_, but I argue in [§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).5 that these form a separate cognate set.

#### 6.2.5. Carrying a child in a sling on the back


During the research for this chapter the set below was included in the set in [§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).4 above. Two facts led to its separation and to the reconstruction of POc _&ast;papa_. First, Lonwolwol has two forms, _baba_ and _fefa_ (N Ambrym _fafa_), admittedly not very different in meaning. Second, Polynesian forms reflect PPn _&ast;fafa_ rather than _&ast;papa_.

It may well be that there is a historical connection between POc _&ast;pʷa(p,pʷ)a_ ‘carry pick-a- back’ and POc _&ast;papa_, tentatively ‘carry a child slung on the back’. It is also possible that reflexes of one have been contaminated by reflexes of the other.

#### 6.2.6. Carrying on the shoulder


See also the generic carrying verb POc _&ast;puat_ ([§6.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-2#cldf:5-6).1), which also seems to have had a specific use ‘carry on shoulder’.

The terms listed below reflect POc _&ast;[qa]paRa-_ ‘shoulder’, reconstructed in [§3.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-3#cldf:5-6). It is possible that the term has been repurposed as a verb at various times and places, but two facts speak against this. First, all the forms listed reflect _&ast;qapaRa_ rather than simply _&ast;paRa_. As noted in the reconstruction of _&ast;[qa]paRa-_, there are a number of body-part and other nouns that are reflected with and without _&ast;qa-_. If the repurposing had taken place on various occasions, we would expect some reflexes without _&ast;qa-_, but none are found. Second, the repurposing must be quite old, as the Malalamai, Gapapaiwa and Longgu forms are no longer used for ‘shoulder’, and the Gumawana, and Misima forms are no longer identical to the noun ‘shoulder’.

#### 6.2.8. Carrying with a shoulder pole


A carrying mode that is quite common among men in Oceanic societies is to attach a load to one end of a short pole and to balance the pole on the shoulder with the load hanging behind and the hand holding the pole’s front end. The POc term for this was _&ast;sola(t)_, _&ast;solat-i-_, widely reflected in Oceanic languages.

#### 6.2.9. Carrying on a long shoulder pole between two people


Once a pig has been captured for slaughter, the favourite way to carry it in Melanesian communities is to tie its legs to a pole, such that the pole can be placed across the shoulders of two men, standing one behind the other, one at each end of the pole, the pig hanging between them. Terms for this mode of carrying occur in numerous Oceanic languages, but no extensive cognate sets are found. The three items below are nonetheless attested.

#### 6.2.10. Carrying under the arm (and on the hip)


The stem of POc _&ast;qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_, &ast;qa(p,pʷ)is-i- ‘carry (a child) on the hip or under the arm’ appears to reflect PAn _&ast;qapiC_/PMP _&ast;qapit_ ‘tongs, anything used to hold things together by pinching’ (ACD). However, aside from the extension in meaning, this derivation is not straightforward. An irregular reflex, POc _&ast;kapit_ ‘tongs’; _&ast;kapi(t)_, _&ast;kapit-i-_ ‘grasp (with tongs)’ is reconstructed in [vol.1(148](ContributionTable?anchor=p-148#cldf:1-6)) (with hindsight this should more accurately be _&ast;ka(p,pʷ)it_ ‘tongs’; _&ast;ka(p,pʷ)i(t)_, &ast;ka(p,pʷ)it-i-)_. Its irregularity lies in the presence of _&ast;k-_ for expected †_&ast;q-_. The terms in the set below, however, do reflect _&ast;q-_.

POc _&ast;qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_, _&ast;qa(p,pʷ)is-i-_ is nonetheless irregular in a different respect. Instead of stem-final _&ast;-t_ it reflects _&ast;-s_. The one exception is the Teop term under ‘cf. also’ below, which reflects _&ast;ka(p,pʷ)it-i-_ ‘grasp (with tongs)’. The apparent replacement of _&ast;-t_ by _&ast;-s_ in the POc form may reflect palatalisation or borrowing at a very early stage, perhaps pre-POc. Alternatively, the resemblance between _&ast;ka(p,pʷ)it_ and _&ast;qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_ may be a matter of chance.

Despite its formal similarity to the set above, the cognate set below evidently reflects PMP _&ast;qabin_ ‘hold or carry under the arm’, POc _&ast;qapi(n)_, _&ast;qapin-i-_ ‘hold or carry under the arm’. However, contamination from POc _&ast;qapiŋa_ ‘armpit’, itself a nominalisation formed from POc _&ast;qapi(n)_ ([§3.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-4#cldf:5-6)), has evidently occurred in Yalu, Mota, Raga and Rennellese and in the Dangal and Buang forms under ‘cf. also’, which have _ŋ_ for †_n_. All the forms under ‘cf. also’ reflect _&ast;k-_ rather than †_&ast;q-_, apparently reflecting contamination from POc _&ast;kapi(t)_, _&ast;kapit-i-_ ‘grasp (with tongs)’ ([vol.1:148](ContributionTable?anchor=p-148#cldf:1-6)).

#### 6.2.11. Carrying in both arms


The common factor among the glosses of items reflecting POc _&ast;tabe_ is one of holding something with both arms.

#### 6.2.12. Carrying on a canoe


Blust (ACD) reconstructs three formally similar PMP terms for ‘load a canoe’: _&ast;Rujan_, _&ast;lujan_, and _&ast;ujan_. He offers no explanation for the existence of three similar forms, and nor can I. In [vol.1(198](ContributionTable?anchor=p-198#cldf:1-7)) it was inferred that Oceanic items reflected POc _&ast;lujan_, and _&ast;ujan_. With a better understanding of Oceanic sound correspondences, _&ast;Rujan_ is inferred here, rather that _&ast;lujan_, and the two POc forms are reconstructed as _&ast;Rujan_, _&ast;Rujan-i-_ and _&ast;ucan_, _&ast;ucan-i-_, both ‘load (s.t.) onto a canoe, transport by canoe’. The two reconstructions differ in two consonant correspondences. The key lies in the medial correspondence. SE Solomonic, Fijian and Polynesian terms unambiguously reflect POc _&ast;-j-_ and are assigned to a single cognate set, whose initial consonant correspondence—PSES _&ast;l-_, PCP &ast;∅- —regularly reflects POc _&ast;R-_.

# FIXME: update/replace/deprecate reconstruction in vol1?

The second set reflects POc _&ast;ucan_, _&ast;ucan-i-_. Several irregularities in the medial consonant reflex are noted below, but none is assignable to _&ast;-j-_.

Finally, the Micronesian set assembled by [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) may reflect either POc _&ast;Rujan_ or _&ast;ucan_. POc _&ast;R_ is lost in many Micronesian etyma, while _&ast;c_ and _&ast;j_ are merged except in Kosraean, which does not have a known reflex of either _&ast;Rujan_ or _&ast;ucan_.

#### 6.2.13. Dragging


Dragging is a form of accompanied caused movement, in that the agent follows the same path as the theme (the thing dragged). In this respect it differs from pulling, where, as with putting, some part of the agent remains in contact with the theme but the agent doesn’t follow the theme’s path ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6)). Only one dragging verb is reconstructable, and only to PROc.

<a id="s-6-3"></a>

### 6.3. Unaccompanied caused movement


Verbs of unaccompanied caused movement form two categories, based on whether or not some part or tool of the agent remains in contact with the theme until the theme reaches its goal. If it does, then we have a putting verb like put, insert or immerse ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1). If it doesn’t, the verb is a verb of sending, like send, drop, throw or pour ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).2).

#### 6.3.1. Putting


‘Putting’ is used here in a specialised sense. The English verb _put_ is ubiquitous. It occurs in dozens of idiomatic phrases like _put out the light_, _put on clothes_, _put to death_, _put down_ (‘humiliate’), _put out_ (‘annoy’), _put off_ (‘postpone’). Its core meaning, however, has to do with moving something to a named location, as in put on the table, put into the bag and so on.

Some verbs of putting profile the resulting posture of the theme, e.g. _He sat the child on the chair_ (result: the child was sitting on the chair). Others profile the path to the resulting location, e.g. _He inserted the key into the keyhole_ (result: the key was in the keyhole).

Verbs of putting in the world’s languages vary as to whether they have a simple verb of putting like English _put_, whether they have verbs that specify the target posture of the theme (i.e. the thing that is put), like German _setzen_ ‘sit, seat’, _stellen_ ‘stand’ and _legen_ ‘lay’, or whether they have a number of putting verbs that, like insert, specify the path of putting, e.g. ‘put into’, ‘put through’, ‘put on top of’, ‘put down’, ‘put up (e.g. onto a shelf)’, ‘put out (e.g. to dry)’, ‘put on a pile’ and ‘put in a line’ ([Narasimhan et al. 2012](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012)).

These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Oceanic languages tend to be of the third type, and the list of path-of-putting categories in the previous sentence is based on Oceanic tendencies. At the same time, most Oceanic languages have a simple ‘put’ verb ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.1), and many have verbs for ‘stand (s.t.) (on s.t)’ and ‘lay (s.t.) (on s.t)’ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).2). Few, however, have a verb for ‘sit (s.t.) (on s.t)’, presumably because, as noted in [§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:5-6), sitting is typically not encoded by a dedicated verb.

Oceanic dictionaries sometimes appear to be incomplete when it comes to putting verbs. One which does contain a comprehensive collection is [Pawley & Sayaba’s](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)) dictionary of Wayan Fijian, which includes the putting verbs tabulated below (two leftmost columns) together with the bases from which they are derived (third and fourth columns). All have the theme as their object except _drosomi-_/_drosoti-_ ‘put s.t. inside’, which takes the location as its object.

Some interesting patterns emerge from the tabulation. There are far more path-profiling than posture-profiling verbs. All the verbs listed except the last are derived from a base listed in the dictionary, and a majority are derived from undergoer-subject verbs (U-verbs; [vol.1:23](ContributionTable?anchor=p-23#cldf:1-2)). Four are derived from a noun denoting the path’s destination. Each of the derived verbs is simply a transitive form of its base, with the exception of vaka-dureni ‘stand s.t. up, make s.t. stand’, formed with the causative prefix _vaka-_. The latter is a posture-profiling putting verb, and supports the view that Wayan Fijian is indeed, in the preliminary typology of [Narasimhan et al.](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012)), a language that elaborates path-profiling rather than posture-profiling verbs of putting.

None of these observations is inconsistent with the data available for other Oceanic languages (other than perhaps Polynesian). Certainly, path verbs play a major role everywhere. Whether they are commonly derived from U-verbs it is impossible to say, as comprehensive dictionaries are not available for other languages that may share this derivation. Another extensive set of verbs of putting is from Mangap-Mbula, which, like all Oceanic languages on or near the New Guinea mainland, does not have U-verbs. and lacks transitive derivational morphology other than the causative prefix _pV-_, which occurs on three posture verbs (the language is exceptional in having a ‘sit’ verb here) and two path verbs. Mangap-Mbula putting verbs are shown in [Table 17](#table-17).

Simple verbs of putting often occur in serial verb constructions. In terms of the division into manner (locomotion), path (geographic direction) and deictic direction verbs put forward in [§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-6) on the basis of occurrence in these constructions, simple verbs of putting occupy the manner slot, i.e. they are verbs of (caused) locomotion. This follows from their encoding the act of putting and from their lack of directional meaning, as well as from their place in serial verb constructions.

[5-6-6-3-449-21](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-6-6-3-449-21)

Posture-profiling verbs of putting occur so rarely in sentence examples that one cannot classify them in this way. Path-profiling verbs of putting, as their label suggests, are verbs of geographic direction.


##### 6.3.1.1. Simple putting


The most widely reflected simple ‘put’ verb is POc _&ast;taRu(q)_ ‘put down, lay down’. The Mapos Buang and Meramera forms are shown under ‘cf. also’ as the expected forms are Mapos Buang †_taɣu_, Meramera †_talu_.

<a id="p-450"></a>

Other apparently simple ‘put’ verbs have only two or three known reflexes. However, whether POc had more than one or two simple ‘put’ verbs is questionable, and it is possible that both &ast;taRu and the two verbs below each had a more specific meaning.

[PEOc &ast;_naki-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-3-450-PEOc-naki-a)

Two other apparently simple ‘put’ etyma have reflexes that are not widespread enough to support POc reconstruction.

##### 6.3.1.2. Posture-profiling verbs of putting


Assuming that lexical sources are reliable, Oceanic languages have far more underived path- than posture-profiling verbs of putting. Where posture-profiling ‘put’ verbs occur, they tend to be transparently derived from posture verbs, as the Wayan and Mangap examples above show. Other instances include those in [Table 18](#table-18).

No underived POc posture-profiling verbs of putting can be reconstructed, but it is likely that there were verbs consisting of cardinal posture stems ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:5-6)–2.3) prefixed by causative _&ast;pa-_. The data in [§6.2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-4#cldf:5-6).3 also suggest that transitive ‘hang’ was formed from an intransitive ‘hang’ verb.


##### 6.3.1.3. Path-profiling verbs of putting


Despite the high numbers of verbs of putting in Oceanic languages that specify a path ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1), only one POc path-profiling verb of putting can be reconstructed, namely _&ast;soŋo_ ‘put into, insert’.

At first blush, the absence of POc reconstructions seems to contradict the statement that Oceanic languages have numerous path-profiling ‘put’ verbs. However, it is probably the very plethora of such verbs in Oceanic languages that leads ironically to the absence of cognate sets. The large number of ‘put’ verbs and their propensity to be derived apparently means that the lexical replacement rate is high in this semantic domain, so that cognates often vanish.

<a id="p-452"></a>


##### 6.3.1.4. Putting in reverse: removing


‘Removing’ in the title of this section refers to acts of unaccompanied caused movement that are opposite in direction to ‘putting’ (e.g. _He took the knife from the table_). In [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).1 it is argued that POc probably had no simple verb of removing that denoted the reversal of putting. Instead it had a simple verb of caused movement that covered both the reversal of putting and accompanied caused motion, i.e. ‘bring’ and ‘take’.

Across the world’s languages verbs of putting often profile both the path along which the object is moved and/or its resulting posture, but verbs of removing tend to profile only the source from which it is moved, not its former posture. Languages in which a verb of removing also encodes the object’s posture are rare ([Narasimhan et al. 2012](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012):10), but one of them occurs in the heart of Melanesia. In the Papuan language Yélî Dnye, located on the periphery of WOc, there are verbs meaning both ‘put into’ and ‘take out of’, ‘put onto’ and ‘take off of’, ‘stand/lay/hang at a location’ and ‘unstand/unlay/unhang from a location’ ([Levinson & Brown 2012](Source#cldf:LevinsonandBrown2012)). Oceanic languages, however, do not resemble Yélî Dnye in this respect. This is no surprise, as even their verbs of putting tend not to profile posture ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-6).1.2). Instead, we typically find a simple verb of removing (‘take out of/from/ away’) along with numerous specialised removal verbs, depending on what is being removed and from where. Many of these verbs concern common domestic processes: removing bark from wood, removing the husk from a coconut, removing fruit from a branch, removing flesh from a coconut or a mollusc, removing the stones from an earth oven, or removing the serrated edge from pandanus leaves. No attempt is made to reconstruct verbs for these meanings here, because they lie outside the semantic domain with which this chapter is concerned and are reconstructed elsewhere ([vol.1:165](ContributionTable?anchor=p-165#cldf:1-6)–168, 277–279). However, Blust (ACD) has reconstructed a simple verb of removal, POc _&ast;unus_, _&ast;unus-i-_ ‘withdraw, pull out, extract’ (I take ‘pull’ in the glosses below simply to be a consequence of caused movement towards the agent).

#### 6.3.2. Sending, dropping, throwing and pouring


‘Send’ verbs denote caused movement where the agent neither accompanies the theme in its movement nor, unlike ‘put’ verbs, remains in contact with the theme until it reaches its goal. In this semantic domain one might expect to be able to reconstruct a simple ‘send’ verb and one or two more verbs whose meaning satisfies these criteria, namely ‘drop’ (‘let fall, cause to fall’) and ‘throw’.

Curiously, neither a simple ‘send’ verb nor one meaning ‘drop’ is reconstructable on the basis of available data. There is no immediately obvious reason for this, as Oceanic languages often have verbs with each of these meanings, but they do not form widespread cognate sets. Many ‘send’ verbs appear to reflect the POc causative prefix _&ast;pa[ka]-_ but the roots to which it is attached do not occur independently in the data. Two that do are Teop (MM) _va-nao_ ‘send’ (_nao_ ‘go’) and Wayan Fijian _vā-kauti-_ ‘send s.t., have s.t. carried or taken’ (_kau_ ‘be carried, taken’). Takia uses a periphrastic causative _-gane -ao_ ‘send’ (_-gane_ ‘do’, _-ao_ ‘go’). A number of ‘drop’ verbs similarly reflect the causative prefix: Poeng (NNG) _pa-pu-e_ ‘drop, cause to fall’ (_pu-pu_ ‘fall’), Iduna (PT) _-ki-ve-beʔu-_ ‘drop from hand, make something fall’ (_beʔu_ ‘fall’, _ki-_ ‘do with hand’, _ve-_ CAUSATIVE), Misima (PT) _pa-bun_ ‘drop’ (_bun_ ‘fall’), Wayan Fijian _vaka-lutu-ni-_ ‘drop (s.t.)’ (_lutu_ [VI] ‘drop, fall’). It thus seems possible that POc used causatives for ‘send’ and ‘go’, and that the plethora of ‘send’ forms in Oceanic languages reflects a re-purposing of other verbs.

The situation with ‘throw’ and ‘pour’, however, is quite different, perhaps because ‘throw’ also profiles the kind of force applied to the theme and ‘pour’ the action applied to the vessel containing the liquid.


##### 6.3.2.1. Throwing


It seems fairly clear that throwing stones was a primary sense of POc _&ast;piri(ŋ)_.

[PCEMP &ast;_biriŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-3-453-POc-piri-a)


<a id="p-454"></a>


##### 6.3.2.2. Pouring


Several verbs of pouring can be reconstructed. The most widely reflected is POc _&ast;liŋi(s)_, _&ast;liŋis-i-_ ‘pour out, spill (liquid)’. POc _&ast;puRi_ ‘pour water on’ took the goal as its object. PWOc _&ast;jiwaR_, _&ast;jiwaR-i-_ ‘pour out (liquid)’ is reflected only in WOc languages, and seems to have replaced _&ast;liŋi(s)_/_liŋis-i-_. It is not clear whether its object was the (liquid) theme or the goal of pouring. As noted below, it may have an earlier shared history with PCP _&ast;suqi_ ‘pour water on/into’, which took the goal as its object.

[PMP &ast;_iliŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-3-454-POc-liis-a)

[POc &ast;_puRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-6-6-3-454-POc-puri-a)


<a id="p-455"></a>

The relationship, if any, between the two reconstructions below, PNGOc _&ast;jiwaR_, _&ast;jiwaR-i-_ ‘pour out (liquid)’ and PCP _&ast;suqi_ ‘pour water on/into’, is somewhat puzzling. Each is based on a regionally restricted cognate set, and the formal similarities between them suggest that they may share an earlier history. Indeed, the Fjian (Bauan and Wayan) terms under PCP _&ast;suqi_ could also reflect _&ast;jiwaR-i-_, if one assumes that the sequence _&ast;-iwa-_ is readily reduced to _&ast;-ua-_ (as in Takia and Sio), then _&ast;-u-_ (as in Kela and Numbami). This would give PCP _&ast;juRi_, hence, e.g. Wayan _sui_. Concomitantly, _&ast;suqi_ would then be demoted to PPn status. Either way, though, PPn _&ast;-q-_ cannot be reconciled with PWOc _&ast;-R-_ without resorting to ad hoc speculation.

## Notes

[^1]: This is a simplified version of [Ameka & Levinson’s](Source#cldf:AmekaandLevinson2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:AmekaandLevinson2007)) categorisation, which see for more detail.

[^2]: Abbreviations in these examples are as follows: ASP aspect marker, CLF classifier, INDEF indefinite, IRR irrealis, REAL realis; ~ connects reduplicates.

[^3]: Oceanic existential constructions tend to be similar to locative constructions, with the one difference that their subject is indefinite (e.g. ‘A cat is sitting under me’ = ‘There is a cat sitting under me). For present purposes, existential constructions are treated as a subtype of locative construction, as in the first Manam example below.

[^4]: A number of sources gloss a verb as ‘be’, but ‘be (at)’ is used here to indicate locative usage,

[^5]: See also the discussion of terms for ‘cold’ in [§4.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8-1#cldf:5-6).

[^6]: Blust labels this form PCEMP, implying that there are also CMP reflexes, but none are listed.

[^7]: More recent work ([Aske 1989](Source#cldf:Aske1989), [Huang & Tanangkingsing 2005](Source#cldf:HuangandTanangkingsing2005), [Croft et al. 2010](Source#cldf:Croftetal2010)) emphasises that many languages have constructions of both types, depending on the semantics of the event.

[^8]: There has been debate ([Slobin 2004](Source#cldf:Slobin2004), [Zlatev & Yangklang 2004](Source#cldf:ZlatevandYangklang2004), [Talmy 2008](Source#cldf:Talmy2008), [Ameka & Essegbey 2013](Source#cldf:AmekaandEssegbey2013)) as to whether a serial verb construction contains a main verb. One criterion offered by Talmy is that the verb belonging to the set with the largest number of members is the main verb. In Oceanic languages this would be the manner verb if there is one, otherwise the path verb.

[^9]: Most descriptions are silent as to how such constructions should be analysed.

[^10]: The expected reflex of _&ast;laka_ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:5-6).3) in both languages is †_laʔa_.

[^11]: John Lynch points out that Clark (2004) reconstructs PNCV _&ast;lakau~&ast;lakawa_ ‘cross over’. I suggest this may be a lexicalised serial verb construction made up of _&ast;laka_ and POc _&ast;ua_ ‘go towards addressee’ ([vol.2:284](ContributionTable?anchor=p-284#cldf:2-8)).

[^12]: Budai Rukai _ma-liu-lius_ (VI) ‘turn round’, Tamalakaw Puyuma _mu-liu-lius_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’, Amis _liyuc_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’.

[^13]: Reconstructed on the basis of Formosan data: Budai Rukai _ma-liu-lius_ (VI) ‘turn round’ ([Ferrell 1969](Source#cldf:Ferrell1969), cited ACD).

[^14]: We thank John Lynch for drawing our attention to the Lenakel reflex.

[^15]: Semantic frames, frame elements and profiling are terms from Frame Semantics, a theory of meaning deriving from the work of Charles J. Fillmore (see especially [Fillmore 1982](Source#cldf:Fillmore1982), [1985](Source#cldf:Fillmore1985)). [Croft & Cruse](Source#cldf:CroftandCruse2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:CroftandCruse2004):8–22 and passim.) provide an overview. A short set of definitions is given at https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/about .

[^16]: This distinction is adopted from [Levin’s](Source#cldf:Levin1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:Levin1993)) analysis of English verbs. Note, though, that by no means all distinctions that work for English verbs work for Oceanic verbs. English take and bring contrast in deixis (‘away from deictic centre’ vs ‘towards deictic centre’), but deixis is not usually profiled by caused movement verbs in Oceanic languages, as the discussion in [§6.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-1#cldf:5-6).1 indicates.

[^17]: [Narasimhan et al.](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:Narasimhanetal2012):10) note that Tzeltal, a Mayan language of Mexico, has a semantically general ‘put’ verb that encompasses both ‘put’ (inanimate goal) and ‘give’ (animate recipient) meanings.

## 1. Introduction


A cognition verb like ‘know’, ‘think’, ‘understand’ or ‘remember’ denotes a concept that speakers are aware of because it denotes an event within their own minds, but often has only indirect correlates in the perceived world. As a result, speakers of different languages classify cognitive events in rather different ways, requiring us first to gain some insight into how speakers of present-day Oceanic languages classify these events.

English cognition verbs tend to cover a range of events. The verb think has a considerable range of meanings:

 1. _Don’t talk to me—I’m thinking._ (cogitation)
 2. _I think John stole the key._ (belief, opinion)
 3. _I didn’t think of it_ (‘I forgot it.’)
 4. _I thought I would go shopping_ (intention)
 5. _I keep thinking about poor Mary_ (‘I’m worried because she is ill’ OR ‘I’m saddened by
   her death’ OR ‘I would like to be with her’)

To be sure, a native speaker disambiguates each meaning in context. The progressive aspect in the present tense (… _am thinking_) in (1) indicates that this is thinking in the sense of cogitation. The complement clause (… _I would go shopping_) in (4) points to intention.

There is probably no other language in the world with a verb whose range of meanings exactly corresponds to those of English _think_ (not even close neighbours like French or German do), but many of our sources give English glosses consisting of a single cognition verb like ‘think’, leaving us ignorant of how the verb thus glossed is used.

To gain insight into how speakers of present-day Oceanic languages classify cognitive events, we have first tried to ensure that we compare like with like semantically. A list of semantic frames for cognition terms was drawn up. A semantic frame is a description of an event, relation, or entity and the participants involved in it.[^1] Making the list was a two-step procedure. First, the [FrameNet website](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/) was consulted. It provides semantic frames for a very large number of English lexemes and, for example, distinguishes the various senses of English _think_. Second, frames were defined that reflect meanings found in dictionaries of Oceanic languages for cognitive states and activities. Semantic frame labels appear below in small capitals. Terms for each frame were found in dictionaries of four Oceanic languages: Nakanai (MM; [Chowning and Goodenough 2014](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014)), To’aba’ita (SES; [Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)), Mwotlap (NCV; [François 2012](Source#cldf:Francois2012)) and Wayan Fijian ([Pawley & Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)) and are tabulated in the sections on knowing ([§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-10)), thinking ([§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-10)) and remembering ([§10.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-5#cldf:5-10)). This constituted a check of the appropriateness of the list of frames and of their possible representation in POc. In the event, several cognition frames that were supported by dictionary glosses did not lead to the reconstruction either of forms or of metaphorical structures, and they are omitted here. These include ‘not know, be ignorant’ (often a simple verb), ‘think about, long for’, ‘be on one’s mind, have s.t. on one’s mind’, ‘remember to do s.t.’, ‘forget to do s.t.’, ‘hope’ and ‘expect’.


<a id="p-536"></a>

A larger language sample would have been ideal, but identifying semantic frames requires sentence examples. These are absent from [Chowning and Goodenough](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014)), but the latter is the best available dictionary of a MM language. Because semantic frames are subject to borrowing by bilingual speakers, and NNG and PT languages have all been in contact with Papuan languages at various points in their histories, they are probably poor indicators of POc’s frames and were therefore excluded from the sample, meaning that WOc could be appropriately represented only by a MM language.

There is a tendency for terms denoting abstractions to be metaphors that refer to less abstract concepts. Metaphors in turn are often encoded by complex lexemes; that is, lexemes made up of two or more simple lexemes. Complex lexemes include body-part metaphors (BPMs; ch.9), serial verb constructions (SVCs),[^3] and compounds derived from either of these, and apparently these have long been productive lexeme-creating devices, as they are also present in Central Malayo-Polynesian and South Halmahera/West New Guinea languages and were apparently constructions of Proto Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. We can be sure that complex lexemes with these structures occurred in POc.

Each section below discusses a single cognition frame or a set of related frames. Sections discussing further frames could be added, but these would not contain reconstructed forms. They would at best list the meanings of complex lexemes together with supporting data, and these are already well enough represented in the chapter.

## 2. Knowing


Verbs encoding three semantic frames denote knowledge in Oceanic languages:

__block - AWARE, e. g. ‘I know that he is coming.’ - ACQUAINTED, e. g. ‘I know him well.’ - EXPERT, e. g. ‘I know how to plant yams.’


<a id="p-537"></a>

Their distribution across verbs in the four witness languages is shown in [Table 22](#table-22).[^4] In Mwotlap, Wayan and To’aba’ita one verb is used for all three frames, but To’aba’ita also has dedicated EXPERT verbs. Nakanai has distinct verbs in each frame, but the AWARE verb _rovi_ also occurs in the ACQUAINTED compound _rovi-lala_. The morpheme _-lala_ is perhaps related (diachronically, at least) to _lalai_ ‘to try (to do s.t.)’. If so, it has a similar meaning to To’aba’ita _toʔo_, which means ‘to try, test’ in a number of compound verbs ([§8.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-5#cldf:5-10)) including apparently _θaitoʔoma-_ ‘know’, but does not occur independently.

<a id="table-22"> </a>

: Table 22         Verbs of knowing in the four witness languages

|            | AWARE                        | ACQUAINTED                    | EXPERT                                                                                        |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|            | ‘know (s.t. /that …)’        | ‘know/recognise (s.o.)’       | ‘know/learn (how to …)’                                                                       |
| Nakanai    | ___rovi___                   | _mata-kilala_ [look-(know)]   | _tahai_, _mari_                                                                               |
|            |                              | ___rovi___-_lala_ [know-? ]   |                                                                                               |
| To’aba’ita | ___θai-toʔoma-___ [(know)-?] | ___θai-toʔoma-___ [(know)-? ] | __θaitoʔoma-__, _filo-_, _filoŋani-_, _maʔalutani-_ [eye-? ], _dau-fīfirisi-_ [? -thoroughly] |
| Mwotlap    | _eɣlal_                      | _eɣlal_                       | _eɣlal_                                                                                       |
| Wayan      | _kilāti-_                    | _kilāti-_                     | _kilāti-_                                                                                     |

The glosses on the second line of [Table 22](#table-22) are intended to capture the fact that in certain contexts (e. g. in the presence of a perfective marker) ACQUAINTED and EXPERT verbs often have dynamic punctual senses, respectively ‘recognise (s.o.)’ and ‘learn (how to …)’.

The POc ‘know’ verb with the most widely distributed reflexes is _&ast;kilala_. It appears to have had AWARE, ACQUAINTED and EXPERT senses, to judge from the more specific glosses in the cognate set below, but it is difficult to be certain. WOc glosses match the PMP gloss, ACQUAINTED. The trisyllabic form is unusual, and there is reasonable evidence for a transitive alternant _&ast;kila-i-_ from which the third root syllable was deleted.

[PMP &ast;_kilala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-537-POc-kilala-a)


<a id="p-538"></a>

A number of languages have verbs that are formally similar to the reflexes above but have meanings that indicate that they more probably reflect POc _&ast;kilat_ (VI) ‘be seen clearly, discerned, recognised’, (VT) ‘see clearly, discern, recognise’ ([§8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:5-10)).

[5-10-2-None-538-ncv-tolomako-kile](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-538-ncv-tolomako-kile)

The Wayan verb _kilāti-_ ‘know’, on the other hand, conflates a form reflecting _&ast;kilat_ with the sense ‘know’.

From the glosses of the data below, POc _&ast;qataq_, _&ast;qataq-i-_ evidently meant ‘know, understand, realise (that)’, encoding AWARE. In a few languages the verb has the same form as the reflex of _&ast;qate-_ ‘liver’ ([§3.7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7-6#cldf:5-10)). Despite the role played by _&ast;qate-_ in bodypart metaphors, particularly those expressing emotions ([§9.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-2-1#cldf:5-10)), however, the resemblance seems to have emerged by chance. Final _&ast;-q_ is attested in Mutu and Namakir.


<a id="p-539"></a>

[POc &ast;_qataq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-539-POc-qataq-a)


<a id="p-540"></a>

The first morpheme of PPn _&ast;qata-mai_ ‘intelligent, expert, clever’ evidently reflected POc _&ast;qataq_.

[PPn &ast;_qata-mai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-540-PPn-qatamai-a)

POc evidently had another term with an EXPERT meaning, _&ast;taqu_, but it is reflected with reasonable certainty only in Anejom (SV) and in Polynesian languages, and two PPn terms are reconstructable: _&ast;tau_ ‘skilful at, familiar with’ and _&ast;mātau_ ‘know, understand, be experienced’. The latter has an apparent Banoni (MM) cognate, allowing the reconstruction of POc _&ast;ma-taqu_ (_&ast;ma-_ was a stative formative; [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-10).4).

[PAn &ast;_Caqu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-540-POc-taqu-a)

[POc &ast;_ma-taqu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-540-POc-mataqu-a)


<a id="p-541"></a>

It is well known that in many languages a perception verb may also mean ‘know, understand (s.t.)’ ([Aikhenvald & Storch 2013](Source#cldf:AikhenvaldandStorch2013), [Evans & Wilkins 2000](Source#cldf:EvansandWilkins2000), [Viberg 1984](Source#cldf:Viberg1984)). English uses ‘I see’ to mean ‘I understand’, i.e. an AWARE sense. This semantic extension occurs occasionally in Oceanic languages. A few NNG languages use a reflex of POc _&ast;reki[-]_, _&ast;reqi[-]_ ‘see, look, see s.t., look at s.t.’ ([§8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:5-10)) also in the sense ‘know’:

[5-10-2-None-541-nng-mangap-re](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-541-nng-mangap-re)

A similar extension of meaning occurs with PPn _&ast;kite_ ‘see, appear, know’ from POc _kita-i-_ ‘see s.t.’, and Raga (NCV) _ilo_ ‘know, perceive’ from POc _&ast;qilo_ ‘be aware of, discern, see’ ([§8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:5-10)). The transitive reflex of POc _&ast;qilo_, namely PPn _&ast;qilo-_ (VI) ‘to know, be aware’, (VT) ‘know s.t.’, had been fully repurposed as a verb of knowing.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;roŋoR-_ ‘hear s.t., listen to s.t.’[^5] with the additional sense ‘know’ are sufficiently widespread to raise the possibility that this sense was already present in POc.

<a id="p-542"></a>

Lexical replacement has evidently been frequent among verbs of knowing, and many reconstructions can be made of verbs that are reflected in just one subgroup. Some are listed here in the hope that their origins may eventually be identified.

[Proto Willaumez &ast;_maci_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-542-ProtoWillaumez-maci-a)

[PPT &ast;_siba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-542-PPT-siba-a)

The verbs below reflect _&ast;sagova_, _&ast;sagov-i-_ ‘know’, reconstructable to a lower-order interstage within the Papuan Tip cluster.

[5-10-2-None-542-pt-gumawana-yagoi](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-542-pt-gumawana-yagoi)

All languages below reflect _&ast;b⟨in⟩isi_, but Nokuku also reflects _&ast;bisi_, implying that _&ast;bisi_ is the root and that _&ast;⟨in⟩_ reflects the POc nominalising infix, the resulting nominalisation having been reanalysed as a verb in these languages.

[PNCV &ast;_bisi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-2-None-542-PNCV-bisi-a)

Interestingly, many Oceanic languages have distinct verbs for ‘not know (s.t.), be ignorant of (s.t.)’ and for ‘not recognise (s.o.)’, but none of the terms found is cognate with any of the others. Some terms are evidently monomorphemic, like Lou _tɔn_ ‘not know’, Mangap _-kus_ ‘not recognise’, Takia _-ŋaoŋ_ ‘not know’, whilst others, like Balawaia _ɣita-lea_ ‘not recognise’ (_ɣita_ ‘see’ + _lea_ ‘miss’) and Wayan _kila sēti-_ ‘not recognise’ (_kila_ ‘know (s.t., s.o)’ + _sēti-_ ‘do s.t. wrongly’) are clearly serial verb constructions.

## 3. Thinking


Across languages verbs of thinking fall into two broad semantic frames:


<a id="p-543"></a>

- OPINE, e. g. ‘I think/believe that he is coming.’
- COGITATE, e. g. ‘I think of/about him/this a lot.’

[Table 23](#table-23) shows that in all four witness languages there is a verb (in bold) that embraces both frames, but in Nakanai, To’aba’ita and Wayan there are other verbs with somewhat more specialised meanings. None of this is surprising. English has believe, surmise, guess, suspect and suppose as OPINE verbs, and a number of COGITATE verbs: cogitate on, consider, ponder, reflect on, contemplate and others, each with a different shade of meaning. Dictionaries often do not encapsulate these shades of meaning well.

<a id="table-23"> </a>

: Table 23     Verbs of thinking in the four witness languages

|            | OPINE                           | COGITATE                                                                                                      |

| Mwotlap    | ___dem___                       | ___dem___                                                                                                     |
| Wayan      | ___nūmi-___                     | ___nūmi-___, _lēŋa-i-_                                                                                        |

OPINE verbs seem to occur less frequently in Oceanic discourse than they do in European languages, and there are at least two reasons for this.

First, OPINE verbs differ from AWARE verbs ([§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-10)) in that a complement clause of the latter is taken to be a fact, whereas the complement clause of an OPINE is not. _I know John is a teacher_ entails the proposition _John is a teacher_ as a fact, but _I think John is a teacher_ doesn’t guarantee the truth of the proposition. One result of this is that in English _I think_ is often little more than a marker of possibility, i.e. ‘perhaps’. The Tok Pisin term for ‘perhaps’ is _ating_, transparently reflecting English _I think_, and many Oceanic languages have a corresponding sentence adverb that is glossed in dictionaries ‘perhaps, I think’; e. g., Mangseng (NNG) _ava_, Misima (PT) _tabam_, Muyuw (PT) _adók_, Tawala (PT) _nugote_, Ramoaaina (MM) _bi-gaŋ_, Sursurunga (MM) _gut_, Teop (MM) _aekas_, Kwaio (SES) _baleʔe_, Mwotlap (NCV) _so_. Of these, however, only the Tawala adverb has a derivational relationship to an OPINE verb (see below), and it seems that in Oceanic languages OPINE verbs typically do not have this bleached ‘perhaps’ function.

Second, OPINE is quite often expressed by a languages’s default verb of saying, so that in Baluan (Adm), for example, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the speaker intends the complement of _pʷa_ to be spoken or simply thought (Dineke Schokkin, pers. comm.). [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b) ([2007b](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b)) gloss the Mangap sentence

[5-10-3-None-543-22](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-543-22)

as both _I say that is not good_ and _I think that is not good_. Thus the meaning of the example ‘say/think’ verbs listed below is something like ‘formulate in words, either spoken or unspoken’.


<a id="p-544"></a>

[5-10-3-None-544-adm-baluan-pa](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-544-adm-baluan-pa)

Hence OPINE verbs in Oceanic languages are centrally about mental activity, and it is not surprising that [Table 23](#table-23) shows them overlapping with COGITATE verbs. Indeed, no dedicated POc OPINE verb that is not also a speech verb is reconstructable.

Glosses of reflexes of POc _&ast;nonom_ ‘think, remember; mind, thought’ point quite strongly to it being a COGITATE verb with a semantic focus on thinking about or remembering something. Its reconstruction, though, involves some ad hoc assumptions about the history of the apparent reflexes listed below. These display a somewhat abstract formal template _nVNV[N]_, where N is _n_ or _m_, but _m_ occurs no more than once in a reflex. The shape is that of POc _&ast;nonom_ (V) ‘think’, (N) ‘mind, thought’, the expected reflex of PAn _&ast;nemnem_ ‘think’ (ACD). However, Blust (ACD) notes Fordata (CMP) _nanaŋ_ ‘remember, remember sadly’, with _-a-_ twice for expected _-e-_ (< PAn _&ast;-e-_). This suggests that there was an alternant of the form _&ast;nanam_ as far back as PCEMP, perhaps ancestral to some of the forms listed below. Treating the forms below as a cognate set also assumes that the presence of three nasals led to metathesis in Seimat and Nehan (_&ast;nVnVm_ > _&ast;nVmVn_), and to assimilation of point of articulation in Bariai, Babatana and Ririo (_&ast;nVnVm_ > _&ast;nVnVn_).

The Wayan transitive verb _num-i-_ (VT) ‘think of s.t.’ requires special mention. As [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1977a) ([1977a](Source#cldf:Blust1977a)) shows, a POc intransitive verb of the form C1V1-C1V1C2 often had a corresponding transitive of the form _C1V1C2-i_. Thus POc _&ast;nonom_ may have been paired with transitive _&ast;nom-i_, of which Wayan _num-i-_ is the only reflex known to us. Alternatively, it may be a back-formation from intransitive &ast;nanum, reflected in Bauan nanu.

[PAn &ast;_nemnem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-544-POc-nonom-a)


<a id="p-545"></a>

The two verbs discussed below, POc _&ast;drodrom_ ‘think, worry; love, be sorry for, long for’ and POc _&ast;nuka_ ‘think, feel’, are both COGITATE verbs, but both also have emotional overtones. Indeed, glosses in Oceanic dictionaries suggest that cogitation and worry or longing frequently go together.

Although its reflex is the Mwotlap default verb for thinking ([Table 23](#table-23)), the NCV evidence, presented in some detail below, suggests that the POc verb was a COGITATE verb with an emotional overtone of ‘love, be sorry for, long for’, i.e. the SORRY semantic frame recognised in [§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:5-10). Indeed, the emotion-related meanings are the only ones recorded for the Nakanai, Nokuku, Namakir, Nguna and S Efate reflexes, and they also figure in the Tamambo and Uripiv glosses. The expected POc reflex of PAn _&ast;demdem_ is POc †_&ast;rodrom_ (_&ast;-md-_ > _&ast;-nd-_ > _-dr-_), but maintaining the consistency of reduplication is perhaps responsible for _&ast;drodrom_. Transitive _&ast;drom-i_ arose via the template recognised by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1977a) ([1977a](Source#cldf:Blust1977a)).

[PAn &ast;_demdem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-545-POc-drodrom-a)


<a id="p-546"></a>

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _&ast;ajem_ ‘heart, mind’. Reflexes are found in SE Solomonic languages, some of which reflect an unexpected initial _&ast;q-_.

[PAn &ast;_ajem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-546-POc-qajom-a)

POc _&ast;nuka_ ‘think, feel’ was also evidently a COGITATE verb, but with a sense of associated emotion—desire for its object. In some daughter languages the reflex of _&ast;nuka_ is a verb, in others a monovalent body-part noun meaning ‘mind’, ‘thought’, ‘feeling’, or ‘desire’, and in yet others both a nominal and a verbal reflex occurs. When it occurs in complex lexemes, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether it is a verb or a noun, and a rule of thumb is adopted such that it is glossed as a verb ‘think’ unless there is clear evidence that it is a monovalent noun.

The reconstruction of &ast;nuka is a little problematic with regard to its medial _&ast;-k-_, and it is tempting to avoid irregularity by splitting the data into two formally similar cognate sets. However, the glosses imply quite strongly that this is a single set. The irregularity occurs in the Micronesian reflexes. Woleaian _nʉ-nʉwa-n_ and Ifaluk _nu-nuwa-n_ reflect either _&ast;nua_ or _&ast;nuqa_, whereas Carolinian _lɨxɨ-lɨx_ reflects _&ast;nuka_. The Adzera medial _-g-_ and Tolai and Ramoaaina final _-k_ reduce the choice to _&ast;nuqa_ or _&ast;nuka_, but could reflect either (final _&ast;-q_ is occasionally retained in New Ireland languages). Since _&ast;q_ is lost in Micronesian languages and the reflexes of _&ast;-k-_ in Chuukic languages like Woleaian and Ifaluk are known to be complex and not always regular ([Jackson 1983](Source#cldf:Jackson1983):175–185), it makes sense to treat the Carolinian reflex as criterial and to reconstruct _&ast;nuka_. The MM and PT reflexes in which _&ast;-k-_ is thus deemed to be lost are all regular.

[POc &ast;_nuka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-3-None-546-POc-nuka-a)


<a id="p-547"></a>

The inherited core meaning of POc _&ast;manaca(m)_ was evidently ‘tame (of animals), familiar to’ (of people). Its form—_&ast;ma-_ + disyllabic root—indicates that it was originally a stative verb, but the glosses of the forms below suggest that it came also to be used of people in the senses ‘quiet, thoughtful, learned’, and then developed the meanings ‘know, understand, think about’ and was also used as an abstract noun. In a number of languages it became the base for a transitive verb. In some languages the original meaning has been lost, but the retention of ‘tame’ as one of its senses in Lau, ’Are’are, Sa’a, Arosi and Owa attests to something like this series of semantic developments. Reflexes vary in meaning between AWARE and COGITATE.

## 4. True and believing to be true


In those Oceanic languages for which there are relevant data[^6] believing something to be true usually differs lexically from OPINE ([§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-10)) and thus forms a separate semantic frame, here labelled BELIEVE. In most of these languages, the basic BELIEVE predicate is a complex form, either a derived verb or, less commonly, a BPM, involving a stative verb root meaning ‘true, real, genuine, correct, right’, a frame here labelled TRUE. The most widespread derivation is a TRUE verb preceded by the prefix that forms causative verbs, reflecting POc _&ast;pa[ka]-_. Verbs with this form are listed in [Table 24](#table-24).

From the examples in [Table 24](#table-24) it seems likely that there was a POc believe verb of the form _&ast;pa[ka]-_ + true verb, but its form is uncertain. The glosses of _&ast;pa[ka]-_ + true verbs in the table point to the likelihood that the basic meaning of POc _&ast;pa[ka]-_ + true was ‘verify as true’, and that ‘believe (s.t.) to be true’ was a secondary meaning. Other derivations with a true root are listed in [Table 25](#table-25). The Takia lexeme is a BPM, and the Owa lexeme is a compound derived from a BPM. The Gela, Longgu, Sa’a and Pn forms are evidently compounds derived from SVCs.


<a id="p-549"></a>

It follows from the material in Tables 21 and 22 that the term to be reconstructed is the stative verb for the true frame rather than a believe verb. In other words, this is an instance where the basic lexeme was a stative verb with the stimulus as subject: ‘X is true’ rather than ‘I believe X’.

<a id="p-550"></a>

The most widely reflected TRUE verb is POc _&ast;tuna_ (sometimes &ast;tutuna) ‘true, genuine, correct’.

[POc &ast;_&#91;tu&#93;tuna_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-4-None-550-POc-tutuna-a)

It is tempting to combine the set below with the set above. All the forms above could reflect putative _&ast;tuquna_, with regular loss of _&ast;-q-_ and shortening of resulting _&ast;-uu-_. However, none of the forms below would be regular reflexes, as they fail to reflect either _&ast;-a_ or _&ast;-na_ as predicted by regular sound change. Either the formal similarity between _&ast;tuna_ and _&ast;(t,d)uqu_ is accidental, or they were associated at some point in their history by an unknown derivational process.

[POc &ast;_(t,d)uqu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-4-None-550-POc-tduqu-a)

Overlapping semantically with the TRUE frame is the STRAIGHT frame, as Oceanic verbs meaning ‘straight’ tend strongly also to have the metaphorical sense ‘correct’, a component of the TRUE frame. Some reflexes of POc _&ast;tonuq_ ‘straight, correct’ have the additional sense ‘true’, and it seems possible that contamination by reflexes of &ast;tuna has occurred, resulting in forms that appear to reflect †_&ast;tunuq_ rather than _&ast;tonuq_. On the strength of Nokuku _ta-tino_ ‘true’ and Kiai _tu-tunu_ ‘good, straight, sweet’ below, all the NCV forms have been attributed to _&ast;tunuq_, but some may either reflect _&ast;tuna_ above or a contamination of one form by the other.


<a id="p-551"></a>

[POc &ast;_tonuq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-4-None-551-POc-tonuq-a)

Several forms with initial _&ast;m-_ meaning ‘true’ can be reconstructed. The reason is perhaps that each has its origins in a form with the PMP anticausative/stative prefix _&ast;ma-_. This is certainly true of reflexes of POc _&ast;ma-qoli_ and _&ast;ma-qoni_, both ‘true, real’. Despite their formal and semantic similarity, they appear to have been separate POc terms. Their similarity has almost certainly led to crossovers in meaning and to conflation of the two terms, as apparently no language other than Anutan reflects both—and the gloss of Anutan maori ‘indigenous, true, close of kin’ suggests it is borrowed from an EPn language. No EPn language has a reflex of &ast;ma-qoni. PEPn _&ast;ma-qoni_ acquired the additional sense ‘native, indigenous’, giving rise to the terms Māori and Mōriori for the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand and New Zealand’s Chatham Islands respectively.

# FIXME: erratum  inn vol2


<a id="p-552"></a>

Perhaps the clearest indicator that the terms originally had slightly different meanings is the contrast in meaning between the PPn causatives PPn _&ast;faka-moqoli_ ‘assent (V)’ and PPn _&ast;faka-maqoni_ ‘tell the truth, be honest’.

There is evidence that Gela, Lau and S Efate reflexes (shown under ‘cf. also’ below) of POc _&ast;ma-qoli_ ‘true, real’ have been conflated with those of POc _&ast;maqurip_ ‘be alive, live, flourish’ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-10).1). All three reflect POc _&ast;-r-_ rather than _&ast;-l-_, and the Gela and Lau reflexes mean ‘alive’ as well as ‘real’.

PEMP _&ast;molaŋ_ ‘true, real, genuine’ has just one known non-Oceanic reflex, Buli _molaŋ_ ‘correct, real, genuine, true’ (ACD).

[PEMP &ast;_molaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-4-None-553-POc-mola-a)

The question mark against POc _&ast;moqi_ below refers to its form. If Takia _mok_ is indeed a reflex, then medial _&ast;-q-_ should be reconstructed.

[POc &ast;_moqi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-4-None-553-POc-moqi-a)

A small number of forms meaning ‘true’, all Northwest or Southeast Solomonic, reflect a root _&ast;mana_. It is tempting to associate these with POc &ast;mʷane ‘straight, direct; flat, level’ (Vol. 2:213),[^9] and this is probably the origin of Gela _mae-mane_ ‘correct’ below. However, neither forms nor meaning otherwise support this association. It is possible that these forms are cognate with PPn _&ast;mana_ ‘supernatural power’ (POLLEX) and reflect the term that Blust (ACD) reconstructs as POc _&ast;mana_ ‘power in natural phenomena; thunder, storm wind’. However, the glosses below suggest (i) that _&ast;mana_/_&ast;ma-mana_ was a homophone of Blust’s reconstruction, and (ii) that the Simbo and Lau reflexes below reflect a conflation of Blust’s POc _&ast;mana_ ‘power…‘ and _&ast;mana_ ‘true’. Since all reflexes of the latter are located in the Solomons archipelago, it is difficult to know which interstage it should be attributed to.

The set below deserves mention because of its frequent occurrence in [Table 25](#table-25). It is restricted to SES languages, and there seems to be no consistent semantic difference between forms with and without _&ast;-ni_.

Finally, the small set below has a curious distribution. Reflexes of PMP _&ast;bener_ occur in Western MP languages, but none are known in Oceanic outside Eastern Polynesian.

## 5. Remembering


Probably all Oceanic languages have terms for MEMORISE (‘commit s.t. to memory’) and for RECALL (‘remember s.t. /that…’), but these terms are usually complex lexemes, ([§10.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-1#cldf:5-10)). The glosses of their components are given henceforth in square brackets. [Table 26](#table-26) sets out terms for the two semantic frames in the four witness languages.

<a id="table-26"> </a>

: Table 26       Verbs of remembering in the four witness languages

|            | MEMORISE                  | RECALL                                 |
|:-----------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
|            | ‘commit (s.t.) to memory’ | ‘remember (s.t. /that …)’              |
| Nakanai    | _mata-toro_ [look-strong] | _hilo-tavu_ [see-towards]              |
| To’aba’ita |                           | _manata oli uri-_ [think back about]   |
| Mwotlap    |                           | _dem sas_ [think find]                 |
| Wayan      | _katoni-_ ‘put in box’,   | _numi-lesu-ni-_ [think-back-TR],       |
|            | _bolani-_ ‘put in basket’ | _divi-_ ‘daydream, remember longingly’ |

The absence of MEMORISE lexemes in Mwotlap and To’aba’ita typifies their absence from many dictionaries. The data are so sparse that they will not be further considered here. The Wayan verbs are simple metaphors: _katoni-_ is derived from _kato_ ‘container with lid’ and bolani- from _bola_ ‘coconut leaf basket, container with lid’.

The default POc RECALL verb was apparently _&ast;nonom_, _&ast;nanam_ ‘think about s.t., remember s.t.’, reconstructed in [§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-10). It encoded both RECALL and COGITATE frames. The only simple RECALL verb in [Table 26](#table-26) is the Wayan verb _divi-_ ‘daydream, remember longingly’, but this includes the additional sense of longing, quite common in RECALL verbs in Oceanic languages.

The remaining RECALL terms in [Table 26](#table-26) are complex lexemes, and three of them begin with the language’s default COGITATE verb. In this they are typical of Oceanic RECALL terms outside Polynesia. It is possible that, for example, the ‘think + find’ sequence immediately below is of POc antiquity, but the data do not allow us to reconstruct the forms that occurred in this and other complex lexemes.

An effect of employing complex lexemes is that they may encode more specific meanings than English usually encodes with remember. Thus one sense of remember, as in ‘He managed to remember the address’, views remembering as finding a piece of information in one’s memory after a search, encoded by a SVC ‘think + find’:

[5-10-5-None-555-pt-dobu-nualoba](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-5-None-555-pt-dobu-nualoba)

These data imply the existence of a compound lexeme meaning ‘search one’s memory for s.t.’, and examples occur, but sometimes with rather vague glosses. Here and below, languages around the Vitiaz Strait replace ‘think’ or ‘mind’ with ‘eye’, giving a BPM.


<a id="p-556"></a>

[5-10-5-None-556-nng-bariai-imatananan](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-5-None-556-nng-bariai-imatananan)

Remembering in the sense of casting one’s mind back, recalling and recollecting is often expressed by the sequence ‘think + go back’ or sometimes ‘think again’. Note below that Iduna has two syntactically different variants of the same expression. In one, _nua-_ ‘mind’, a monovalent noun, is subject of the verb _-nauye-_ ‘go back’. The other is a compound verb made up of the same morphemes.

[5-10-5-None-556-nng-mangap-mataimiili](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-5-None-556-nng-mangap-mataimiili)

Remembering in the MEMORISE sense of holding something in one’s memory is expressed in a number of WOc languages by the sequence ‘think + hold’, or in Nehan by a simple ‘hold’ metaphor.

[5-10-5-None-556-nng-kove-mataxuvara](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-5-None-556-nng-kove-mataxuvara)

Much the same concept is occasionally expressed by a ‘think + stay’ sequence:

<a id="p-557"></a>

In many Oceanic languages, serialisation and compounding have remained productive, and there are complex lexemes that appear to be quite localised:

<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Forgetting


Like terms for RECALL, many terms for forgetting are complex lexemes, the first component of which is either the default COGITATE verb or the body-part noun that the language uses for ‘mind’. The second component is a verb, the meanings of which are in several instances quite widespread. There are dozens of combinations in the data. A geographically well distributed combination is ‘think/mind’ + ‘lose’.

[5-10-6-None-557-adm-nyindrou-balemani](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-557-adm-nyindrou-balemani)

Another is ‘think/mind’ + ‘short’, where ‘short’ is apparently used metaphorically for ‘lacking’. The two terms below are from the opposite geographic extremes of MM.

[5-10-6-None-557-nng-poeng-laupogo](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-557-nng-poeng-laupogo)

The existence of a verb meaning ‘not know’ in many Oceanic languages was noted in [§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-10). It figures as the second component of the following lexemes.

[5-10-6-None-557-nng-takia-iloao](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-557-nng-takia-iloao)

A number of complex lexemes glossed ‘forget’ have a verb meaning ‘leave, go away’ as one of their components, usually the second. However, some of these have glosses—‘abandon’, ‘leave behind’—that imply a conscious choice to forget.


<a id="p-558"></a>

[5-10-6-None-558-adm-baluan-wotlilisek](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-558-adm-baluan-wotlilisek)

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009):130) reconstructs a PNCV BPM _&ast;lolo- boŋi_ [mind night] ‘forget’, and infers that one component or the other has been replaced in various languages. He may well be right, but a more conservative inference is that a complex lexeme ‘mind’ + ‘night’ was present in early EOc. The terms for ‘night’ reflect either POc _&ast;rodrom_ ‘be dark, be night’ or POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night’ ([vol.2:295](ContributionTable?anchor=p-295#cldf:2-9)–298). In some languages this BPM also has the sense ‘be ignorant’ ([§11.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3-4#cldf:5-10).1).

[5-10-6-None-558-ses-saa-maarodo](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-558-ses-saa-maarodo)

PPn _&ast;nimo_ ‘vanish, forget’ perhaps reflects a metaphorical use of ‘vanish’ for ‘forget’.

[PPn &ast;_nimo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-6-None-558-PPn-nimo-a)

PPn _&ast;ŋalo_ uses the metaphor of a submerged (i. e. hidden) rock for ‘forgotten’.

<a id="p-559"></a>


<a id="s-7"></a>

## 7. Deciding


The gloss ‘decide’ is rare in dictionaries of Oceanic languages, implying that deciding is not an Oceanic concept. One reason for this is that major decisions are traditionally made by consensus, for which—if one digs far enough—a term can be found. Its meaning, though, often includes the foregoing discussion as well as the decision.

[5-10-7-None-559-nng-takia-awatumani](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-7-None-559-nng-takia-awatumani)

No reconstruction can be made, and no consistent BPM pattern has been found.

On the rather rare occasions that one finds a term that appears to denote individual decision-making, it typically also includes either a reference to planning or to choosing. Indeed, the gloss ‘plan’ occurs rather more frequently than ‘decide’, but again no reconstruction is possible. ‘Choosing’, on the other hand, is clearly an Oceanic concept, and a verb can be reconstructed ([§10.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-10#cldf:5-10)).

When one searches a dictionary for ‘decide’, the gloss ‘undecided’ frequently turns up, and this is the topic of the next section.


<a id="s-8"></a>

## 8. Being undecided, of two minds


The English idioms ‘be of two minds’ (this section) and ‘be of one mind’ ([§10.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-9#cldf:5-10)) translate as semantically similar BPMs in Oceanic languages.

Numerous expressions in Oceanic languages for ‘be undecided’ translate roughly as ‘be of two minds’. Expressions for ‘be undecided’ have been found in three of the four witness languages, and examples are given in [Table 27](#table-27).

The Nakanai example and the first To’aba’ita example are BPMs, with a body-part as subject and ‘two’ as predicate. The second To’aba’ita example is a compound verb, ‘mind’ + ‘two’, presumably derived from a BPM. The Wayan example also appears to be a BPM-derived compound, but here ‘two’ is replaced by ‘entangled (with weeds)’.

BPMs that are semantically similar to the top three examples in [Table 27](#table-27) are widespread in Oceanic languages (but seemingly infrequent in Vanuatu), and such a metaphor almost certainly occurred in POc.

If by inference the POc body part in this context was _&ast;lalom_ ‘insides’ ([§9.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-4#cldf:5-10)), then the POc BPM _&ast;lalo- rua-rua_ is a plausible reconstruction.

In a few languages a reduplicated reflex of POc _&ast;rua_ ‘two’ with the sense ‘twofold’ serves alone as ‘of two minds’.

[5-10-8-None-561-mic-carolinian-rar](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-8-None-561-mic-carolinian-rar)

Occasionally the BPM turns up with ‘many’ instead of ‘two’, indicating that in some languages at least the metaphor remained productive.

## 9. Agreeing, being of one mind


Metaphors for ‘agree, reach consensus, be unanimous’ fall into two patterns. The first roughly translates ‘be of one mind’. Its POc form may well have been parallel to that of POc _&ast;lalo- rua-rua_ ‘be of two minds’ ([§10.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-8#cldf:5-10)), but its reconstruction is obstructed by the fact that several POc forms for ‘one’ can be reconstructed (Lynch, Ross & Crowley 2002:72), and their distribution is not yet well enough understood to infer which form probably occurred in this BPM.

[5-10-9-None-561-nng-takia-ilokisaek](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-9-None-561-nng-takia-ilokisaek)

Other languages employ a variety of complex lexemes meaning ‘mind together’ or ‘speak together’.

## 10. Choosing


Choosing is a cognitive act, but it is one that has visible physical consequences, and it is perhaps for this reason that a POc etymon, _&ast;piliq_ (VI), _&ast;piliq-i-_ (VT) ‘choose, select, pick out’ , has enjoyed considerable continuity and relatively little replacement.

## 11. Learning and teaching


To teach someone something is to cause them to learn it, and the learner then either knows what has been taught or knows how to do something. This causative relationship is explicit in many Oceanic languages. Occasionally it is expressed simply by using the same transitive verb for learning something and teaching something, as in the instances below:

[5-10-11-None-563-ses-tolo-sasani](cf.csv#cldf:5-10-11-None-563-ses-tolo-sasani)

More often ([Table 28](#table-28)) it is expressed by attaching a causative prefix, usually a reflex of POc _&ast;pa[ka]-_ CAUSATIVE, to a root meaning ‘know’ ([§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-10)) or ‘learn’. Since to learn is often synonymous with ‘come to know’, the English distinction between ‘know’ and ‘learn’ is not relevant in this context.

The Bariai (NNG), Misima (PT) and Halia (MM) items above, along with Dawawa (PT) _wai-kata-i_ ‘show’, suggest that there was a PWOc causative _&ast;paka-qataq-i-_ ‘teach, cause to know, show’, formed from _&ast;qataq-i-_ ‘know, understand, realise (that)’ ([§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-10)).

Another semantic dimension of verbs of learning and teaching arises out of teaching styles in traditional Oceanic communities. A young person learned how to do something by watching an older person and imitating them, and this is reflected in the fact that POc _&ast;towa_ ‘imitate, learn by imitation’ and POc _&ast;usuri_/_&ast;usawiri_ ‘imitate’ below both have ‘imitate’ as their primary sense. The causatives formed from them, however, mean ‘teach, instruct’, presumably by demonstration.

Lou, Baluan and Manam reflexes of intransitive POc _&ast;towa_ ‘imitate, learn by imitation’ reflect a transitive _&ast;towa-(a)kini-_ ‘learn (s.t.) by imitation’ formed with the suffix _&ast;-(a)kini_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-10).2). Curiously, PT reflexes of &ast;towa are formed with a causative prefix, but mean ‘imitate’ rather than ‘teach’.

At first sight, the set below appears to reflect the POc root _&ast;usuri_, but the Ramoaaina and Nehan reflexes suggest that formal reconstruction is more complicated. The Nehan root _sairi_ contains no internal _-u-_. The fact that NW Solomonic languages lose _-w-_. but not _-u-_, suggests that _sairi_ reflects _usawiri_ (with unpredicted loss of initial _u-_). Ramoaaina loses _-s-_, and its expected reflex of _&ast;usuri_ would be †_ūr_, rather than actual wer, which also attests to the presence of _&ast;-w-_ followed by an unrounded vowel.

Reflexes of another term for ‘learn’ are known only from Gapapaiwa and from Polynesian languages.

[POc &ast;_akop_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-10-11-None-565-POc-akop-a)

The primary meaning of POc _&ast;[ña]ñau_ appears to have been ‘teach’, perhaps centring on parents or seniors instructing children orally about their responsibilities (cf Lukep, Sursurunga and Kwaio glosses) and/or showing them how to perform traditional practices (cf Gela and Lau glosses).


<a id="p-566"></a>

The form of _&ast;[ña]ñau_ is open to question. If the Nyindrou term is indeed a reflex, then the POc consonant was _&ast;ñ_. But if the Nyindrou term is not a reflex, and the Titan term listed under ‘cf. also’ is a proper reflex, then the form was _&ast;[na]nau_.

## 12. Conclusion


For many cognition frames no POc term can be reconstructed. Apparently because their meanings are abstract, their lexical replacement rate is considerably higher than for items with less abstract meanings ([§9.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-6#cldf:5-10)). As we have noted, abstract states and activities tend to be encoded metaphorically as complex lexemes.

At the same time, it is reasonable to infer that, for example, the ‘think + find’ SVC pattern for ‘remember’ in [§10.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-5#cldf:5-10) is quite probably of POc antiquity, as it occurs in widely distributed languages. However, the data do not allow us to reconstruct the forms that occurred in this and other complex lexemes, and so the possibility of independent parallel innovation cannot be excluded. Thus for remembering ([§10.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-5#cldf:5-10)), forgetting ([§10.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-6#cldf:5-10)) and being of one mind ([§10.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-9#cldf:5-10)) no forms are reconstructed, but complex lexemes are described, as they give us some insight into how POc speakers conceived these cognitive activities. For deciding ([§10.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-7#cldf:5-10)) not even a consistent pattern of complex lexemes is found, and the same is true of hoping and expecting, which are omitted here.


## Notes

[^1]: Semantic frames are part of Frame Semantics, a theory of meaning deriving from the work of Charles J. Fillmore (see especially [Fillmore 1982](Source#cldf:Fillmore1982), [1985](Source#cldf:Fillmore1985), [Croft & Cruse 2004](Source#cldf:CroftandCruse2004):8–22 and passim.).

[^3]: Oceanic SVCs are described by [Crowley](Source#cldf:Crowley2002d) ([2002d](Source#cldf:Crowley2002d)) and in the contributions to [Bril & Ozanne-Rivierre](Source#cldf:BrilandFrancoiseOzanneRivierre2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:BrilandFrancoiseOzanneRivierre2004)).

[^4]: Bolded verbs are identical across frames. Glosses in square brackets give senses of compound elements. Parentheses indicate that an element does not occur independently with this meaning, which is inferred either from occurrence in several compounds or from cognates in closely related languages.

[^5]: Reflexes of POc _&ast;roŋoR-_ raise a number of formal challenges. These are discussed in [§8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-3#cldf:5-10).

[^6]: In a number of languages for which there are otherwise good data, including Nakanai and Mwotlap, two of our witness languages, BELIEVE terms are not recorded.

[^7]: Reflexes of initial _&ast;t-_ and _&ast;d-_ both occur, and the latter are listed under ‘cf. also’. They give grounds for reconstructing a POc doublet _&ast;donuq_ ‘straight, correct’. How it arose is unknown, but _&ast;d_ was the least frequently occurring of all the POc obstruents, reflecting an earlier _&ast;nt_ sequence.

[^8]: In his dictionary of Arosi [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) takes _moi_ ‘true’ to be an ‘abbreviated’ form of _mori_ ‘true’ (under _&ast;maqurip_ above), but this is not a regular phonological process in the language.

[^9]: In vol.2 this form was reconstructed as _&ast;mʷane-mʷane_, but the reduplication is not justified by the data.

[^10]: SE Ambrym _e-_ is a monovalent noun used in a few complex lexemes and has no independent meaning.

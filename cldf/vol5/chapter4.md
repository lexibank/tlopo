## 1. Introduction


This chapter is complementary to chapter 3 on the human body. Whereas the latter is devoted to the nouns that label the parts of the body, the present chapter is dedicated to events and states that are associated with the body’s natural processes. Events in this context include both processes that occur spontaneously (sweating, breathing, snoring) and deliberate activities like eating, drinking and copulating. In between these two extremes are numerous events the agentivity of which is open to question: sleeping, belching, yawning, defecating, laughing, crying and so on.

The chapter begins with events and states relating to life, death and reproduction ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:5-4)). These are followed by events and states that have to do with eating, drinking and the digestive organs ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:5-4)). Then follow events concerned with the emission or elimination of bodily substances ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:5-4)), with breathing and the respiratory organs ([§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:5-4)), with sleeping and waking ([§6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6#cldf:5-4)), with physical responses to emotion, pain or cold ([§7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:5-4)), and with body temperature ([§8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8#cldf:5-4)). A separate chapter, ch.5, deals with terms relating to sickness and health. The line drawn between this chapter and ch.5 is at times somewhat arbitrary. Terms denoting itching, dizziness and pain are handled in ch.5.

One might think because the subject matter of this chapter deals with aspects of the life of all human beings, culture would impinge less here that in other areas of the lexicon. Perhaps this is true, but there are a surprising number of points in this chapter where culture, broadly conceived, is encapsulated in lexical choices. Although there was a general POc term for drinking, drinking was also subdivided into two different physical acts ([§3.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-1#cldf:5-4)). One was pouring liquid down the throat without the vessel touching the lips, a practice which probably has its roots in drinking coconut water from a small hole in the shell. The other was sipping and slurping liquid directly from a vessel. Similarly, chewing and sucking also each constituted more than one activity, depending on what was chewed ([§3.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-2#cldf:5-4)) or what was sucked on ([§3.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-2#cldf:5-4)–3). Certain sucking noises served as signals of refusal or attention-getting (§[§3.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-1#cldf:5-4)–2), whilst kissing appears to have lacked a distinct label. In Central Pacific languages what other languages commonly conceive as the states of being hungry, thirsty and sleepy are commonly conceived as desires: ‘want to eat’ ([§3.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-1#cldf:5-4)), ‘want to drink’ ([§3.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-2#cldf:5-4)) and ‘want to sleep’ ([§6.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-1#cldf:5-4)).

## 2. Living, dying, reproducing and growing



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Living, dying and being healthy


The principal POc verbs for ‘be alive’ and ‘die, be dead’ have an interesting and complementary range of meanings. The verb _&ast;maqurip_ is glossed ‘be alive, live, flourish; be in good health, recover health’, whilst _&ast;mate_ is glossed ‘be dead, die; be unconscious, numb, paralysed, lose consciousness; die, of fire or light’. These ranges of meaning are continued in many modern Oceanic languages.

Like many verbs denoting states, both these verbs and their reflexes may also be used inchoatively, i.e. of coming to be in a state ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).1). This explains why _&ast;maqurip_ and many of its reflexes mean both ‘be in good health’ and ‘recover health’, and why _&ast;mate_ and many of its reflexes mean both ‘be dead’ and ‘die’, as well as ‘be unconscious’ and ‘faint, become unconscious’.

The semantically interesting feature of these two verbs is that they were used not only to denote living and dying, but that they were also used of a person’s state of health or consciousness. Someone in good health or recovering their health was labelled _&ast;maqurip_ ‘alive’ or ‘coming alive’. Someone unconscious or fainting was labelled _&ast;mate_ ‘dead’ or ‘dying’.


<a id="s-2-1-1"></a>

#### 2.1.1. Being alive


Two POc intransitive verbs had the meaning ‘be alive’. One, POc _&ast;mañawa_ ‘breath, breathe, be alive; fontanel; rest’ evidently had the central meaning ‘breathe’ and is presented with a detailed discussion in [§5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:5-4). The other, _&ast;maqurip_ had the central meaning ‘be alive’ but, as mentioned above, it inherited a wider set of meanings from PMP _&ast;qudip_ which Blust (ACD) describes as ‘a dominance of vitality as manifested in growth, flourishing, and being healthy, fresh (of plants), or green (of plants, wood)’.

[PAn &ast;_qudip_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-1-210-POc-maqurip-a)


<a id="p-211"></a>

The coexistence of PPn _&ast;maquri_ ‘live, alive’ continuing POc _&ast;maqurip_ above and PPn _&ast;ola_ ‘be alive, well, healthy; recover from illness’ poses a semantic question. Why would two PPn terms coexist for what is apparently the same concept? The answer may be found in the comparison of Wayan Fijian _ðola_ with PPn _&ast;sola_ ‘flee, escape danger’. The Wayan gloss reads (1) ‘be alive, living, live’; (2) ‘survive, escape danger’; (3) ‘recover from illness’; (4) ‘be healthy, well’; (5) ‘(of living things) grow, thrive, flourish’. Meaning 2, ‘survive, escape danger’, accords with PPn _&ast;sola_ whose reflexes consistently mean ‘flee’. What Wayan includes within one term PPn evidently separated into _&ast;sola_ ‘flee, escape danger’ and _&ast;ola_ ‘be alive, well, healthy, recover from illness’, with almost no overlap of meaning.


<a id="p-212"></a>

Many Polynesian languages retain reflexes of both POc _&ast;maqurip_ and PPn _&ast;ola_. Each Polynesian language distinguishes the two terms by various subtleties of meaning. Eastern Polynesian languages tend to use reflexes of _&ast;maqurip_ to denote matters of the spirit and consciousness while _&ast;ola_ reflexes are concerned more with physical health.

#### 2.1.2. Dying and being dead


Reflexes of PAn _&ast;ma-aCay_, PMP _&ast;m-atay_ ‘die, dead’ have from very early times carried a number of extended meanings. POc _&ast;mate_ evidently included among its meanings ‘be unconscious, numb, paralysed’, as noted in [§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-4), and if reduplicated, ‘be weak or ill’.[^1] But there were further extensions in meaning, some of them apparently already present in POc. The tabulation below presents an analysis of the meanings of verbal reflexes of POc _&ast;mate_ in Mangap (NNG) _-mēte_, Gela (SES) _mate_, To’aba’ita (SES) _mae_ and Wayan Fijian _mate_ as they are given in dictionaries of these languages ([Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen 2007b](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b), [Fox 1955](Source#cldf:Fox1955), [Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008), [Pawley & Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)).

The extensions of meaning shown above vary somewhat across the four languages, but we suspect that the differences are not as great as they appear from the tabulation, i.e. that some senses have been omitted from the dictionary glosses. The tabulation suggests that ‘be[come] paralysed (of a body-part)’, ‘die down, be[come] calm (of storm, wind or sea)’ and ‘go out (of fire)’ are senses that were present in POc, and the glosses of reflexes in the cognate set below indicate that ‘be[come] unconscious’, and ‘be[come] numb’ should be added to these. As the glosses of a number of reflexes below indicate, POc _&ast;mate_ apparently also participated in a metaphor parallel to English ‘to die for’, i.e. ‘to desire strongly’ (see [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:5-4)). Note that ‘be[come]’ in these glosses reflects the typical situation in Oceanic languages whereby the aspect marker(s) that accompany a verb denoting a property indicate(s) whether it is to be taken statively or inchoatively.

Omitted from the table are a nominal sense of To’aba’ita _mae_, namely ‘k.o. evil spirit in the bush, used by its possessor to kill people’ and nominal senses of Wayan Fijian _mate_: ‘death’, ‘paralysis’, ‘failure to work, malfunction’ and ‘sickness, disease, ailment’. The latter simply reflect a zero nominalisation strategy. Their correspondents in Mangap and To’aba’ita are formed with nominalising suffixes.

### 2.2. Reproducing



<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. Copulating


Two terms are reconstructed for sexual intercourse, POc _&ast;qait_, _&ast;qait-i-_ and PEOc _&ast;pai(s)_, _&ast;pais-i-_.

The first of these appears to continue PMP _&ast;ayu[t,d]_, which Blust (ACD) reconstructs to PWMP because he lacks Oceanic reflexes. If POc _&ast;qait_ does represent a continuation, albeit with irregular prepended _&ast;q-_, then _&ast;ayu[t,d]_ is promoted to PMP. POLLEX attributes the Polynesian reflexes of this etymon to POc _&ast;saqit_ (PPn _&ast;haqi_), but the initial sound correspondences reflect PPn _&ast;q-_, not _&ast;h-_. Kwaio _l-_ and Bauan Fijian _ð-_ ultimately reflect accretion of _&ast;[y]_ before initial _&ast;a-_ after loss of _&ast;q-_ ([Lichtenberk 1988](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1988), [Geraghty 1983](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983)).

Two POc forms are reconstructable: intransitive _&ast;qait_ ‘copulate’, with a non-singular subject, and transitive _&ast;qait-i-_ ‘have sexual intercourse with s.o.’ , with a singular subject.

[PMP &ast;_ayu&#91;t,d&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-216-POc-qait-a)


<a id="p-217"></a>

The reciprocal forms in the set below reflect the addition of reflexes of POc _&ast;paRi-_ RECIP to _&ast;qai(t)_/_&ast;qait-i-_ ‘have sexual intercourse (with s.o.)’. The reflexes are few enough to suggest that these are local formations, and that the POc form is not necessarily reconstructable. Indeed, as reciprocals with _&ast;paRi-_ were typically intransitive, only the Tawala form, reflecting POc intransitive _&ast;qait_, appears to be a direct descendant of the likely POc form _&ast;paRi-qait_. The Samoic–Outlier forms all reflect loss of _&ast;-a-_, i.e. _&ast;fe-qiti_ for expected †_&ast;fe-qaiti_.

[POc &ast;_paRi-qait_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-217-POc-pariqait-a)

[Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) imply that the Micronesian reflexes below may reflect an interrogative verb meaning ‘do what?’, and POLLEX reconstructs PPn _&ast;fai_ ‘do, make’, homophonous with _&ast;fai_ ‘copulate’ as in Tongan and Samoan.

It is not clear whether the South Vanuatu forms below are cognate or not.

[PEOc &ast;_pai(s)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-217-PEOc-pais-a)


<a id="p-218"></a>

The following PMP reconstructions by Blust (ACD) have respectively one and two known Oceanic reflexes. PMP _&ast;duluR_ was perhaps already a euphemism for copulation, as Blust (ACD) records Cebuano (C Philippines) dulug ‘sleep with someone’. Note, however, that the initial consonants do not correspond: the expected POc root is †_&ast;ruluR_ or _&ast;druluR_.

<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. Sexual desire


No term can be reconstructed here, but a number of languages use their term for ‘itchy’ ([§5.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-2#cldf:5-4).4), either alone or in a body-part metaphor (ch.9) to mean ‘sexually excited’.

[5-4-2-2-218-nng-gedaged-magagau](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-218-nng-gedaged-magagau)


<a id="s-2-2-3"></a>

#### 2.2.3. Being pregnant


POc _&ast;tian-an_ ‘pregnant’ is derived from PAn _&ast;tiaN_ ‘belly’, which also gave rise to POc _&ast;tia-_ ‘belly’ ([§3.5.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-9#cldf:5-4)). It is rather easy to mistake a reflex of _&ast;tian-an_ for a reflex of _&ast;tia-_. For example, Loniu _tiyan_ is a reflex of POc _&ast;tian-an_ ‘pregnant’, not of POc _&ast;tia-_ ‘belly’, as POc final &ast;-VC is normally lost in Admiralties languages.


<a id="p-219"></a>

It is possible that some reflexes of POc _&ast;tian-an_ have been conflated with a reflex of POc _&ast;tina-ña_ ‘his/her mother; big, biggest’, discussed in [vol.2:195](ContributionTable?anchor=p-195#cldf:2-7), and as a result have lost the first _&ast;-a-_. A pregnant woman is naturally described as a woman with a large belly (e.g. Nyindrou [Adm] _drine-n i tinan_ [belly-her go big] ‘her belly is getting big; she is pregnant’), and, for example, Siar _tinan_ ‘pregnant’ has the form that is expected of a reflex of _&ast;tina-ña_ rather than of _&ast;tian-an_.

<a id="s-2-2-4"></a>

#### 2.2.4. Giving birth


Although there is clear external support for POc _&ast;pañaRu_ ‘give birth’, all Oceanic subgroups apart from Polynesian have adopted other terms. PPn _&ast;fanau_ evidently could be used in both an active ‘give birth’ and stative ‘be born’ sense.

[PMP &ast;_pañaRu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-219-POc-panaru-a)


<a id="p-220"></a>

Nominalised forms carry a range of associated meanings:

[5-4-2-2-220-pn-samoan-fanaua](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-220-pn-samoan-fanaua)

The two following reconstructions, _&ast;pasu[su]_ ‘(mother) give birth’ and _&ast;pusa_ ‘(baby) be born’ raise a number of questions. If metathesis was ever involved in assumed forms _&ast;pasu_ and _&ast;pusa_, evidence from Gela and Bugotu shows that there is now clear separation of form and meaning.

The form of _&ast;pasu[su]_ suggests that it reflects _&ast;pa-susu_, i.e. causative prefix + ‘suck’. POc _&ast;susu_ meant ‘suck’[^2] ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).3) and _&ast;pa-susu_ meant ‘suckle, feed (baby) at the breast’, i.e. ‘cause to suck’. Two questions arise:

A) Does _&ast;pasu[su]_ reflect _&ast;pa-susu_, derived from the latter by metonymy?
B) If yes, were _&ast;pasu[su]_ ‘give birth’ and _&ast;pa-susu_ ‘suckle’ a single verb in POc?

There are two sets of evidence, and they are in conflict. First, reflexes of _&ast;pa-susu_ ‘suckle’ in [§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).3 all reflect the disyllabic root _&ast;-susu_, whereas several reflexes of _&ast;pasu[su]_ ‘give birth’ do not reflect the disyllabic root and instead reflect POc _&ast;pasu_. What is more, in several languages (Hote, Tinputz, Bugotu, Gela, Tolo) the form for ‘breast’ is different enough from the portion of the verb that reflects _&ast;-su[su]_ to indicate that POc _&ast;pasu[su]_ ‘give birth’ was not (or was no longer) derivationally related to POc _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast’. These facts suggest rather strongly that the answer to question B is ‘no’, _&ast;pasu[su]_ and &ast;pa-susu were not a single verb in POc.

The opposing set of evidence is as follows. In Southeast Solomonic and Central Pacific the POc causative prefix _&ast;pa-_ has been replaced by reflexes of _&ast;paka-_, the causative form that originally occurred with statives, and so the Arosi, Wayan and Bauan forms appear transparently to reflect _&ast;pa-susu_, pointing to an affirmative answer to question B. Further, in certain other languages (Arop-Lukep, Teop, Mota, Raga) the reflex of the _&ast;-susu_ part of POc _&ast;pasusu_ ‘give birth’ is identical with the reflex of POc _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast’, or nearly so.


<a id="p-221"></a>

How can this conflict be resolved? The answer is a little complicated. The evidence for POc &ast;pasu ‘give birth’ is well enough distributed (Hote, Bugotu, Gela, Paamese) to suggest that it was a separate verb from _&ast;pa-susu_ ‘suckle’, and the first set of evidence indicates that it had no derivational relationship to _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast’. To account for the second set of evidence, however, we infer that in certain languages the reflex of the _&ast;-susu_ part of _&ast;pasusu_ ‘give birth’ was (by chance?) similar enough to the reflex of _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast’ for reanalysis by folk etymology to take place, so that the reflex of _&ast;pa-_ was reanalysed as the causative prefix and the reflex of the _&ast;-susu_ as ‘breast’.

Thus we answer question B above in the negative. We have no definitive evidence regarding question A.

[POc &ast;_pasu&#91;su&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-2-2-221-POc-pasusu-a)

Although POc _&ast;pusa_ ‘be born’ is straightforwardly reconstructable, Oceanic languages also reflect several forms that are similar in that they have an initial labial followed by _&ast;-u-_ or _&ast;-o-_ and a medial apical, but they cannot be readily accounted for. Their resemblances have arisen by chance, and are listed below.

### 2.3. Growing


A number of PT and Mic reflexes of POc _&ast;tubuq_ ‘grow, swell’ ([vol.1:134](ContributionTable?anchor=p-134#cldf:1-5)), evidently used of humans, animals and plants, are glossed ‘be born’. Some Polynesian reflexes, although retaining the central meaning ‘grow’, extend it to include ‘originate’, ‘issue’, and ‘be descended from’, all ideas associated with birth.

## 3. Ingestion and related activities and states



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Eating and chewing


In this section are presented reconstructed verbs which have to do with the ingestion of solids. A pair of verbs meaning ‘eat’ is given in [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1. This is followed by verbs of chewing, which fall into two categories, namely chewing something as part of the process of eating ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).2), and chewing something in order to extract its ingestible content, after which the chewed remains are spat out ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).3). The latter category includes general verbs of chewing without eating and verbs denoting the culturally significant activity of chewing betelnut.


<a id="s-3-1-1"></a>

#### 3.1.1. Eating


Across the world’s languages the verbs for ingestion tend to be exceptional in their lexical and grammatical behaviour. A typical transitive verb like English hit (as in _The man hit the dog_) has a volitional agent as its subject (the man) and an affected patient as its object (the dog). English eat and drink, on the other hand, can occur quite naturally in both transitive and intransitive constructions, e.g. _The man ate the banana_ vs. _The man ate_, whereas it requires considerable ingenuity to think up possible contexts for intransitive _The man hit_ (cf [Næss 2009](Source#cldf:Nss2009):35). The apparent reason that ‘eat’ and ‘drink’ verbs allow a transitive/intransitive alternation in many languages is that they do not have the kind of meaning that is typically encoded by a transitive construction ([Newman 2009](Source#cldf:Newman2009):6). Certainly the person who eats or drinks is normally a volitional agent, and there is a sense in which what is eaten is an affected patient. But unlike verbs meaning ‘hit’, or even ‘destroy’, where the fate of the patient is part of what is profiled by the verb, ‘eat’ and ‘drink’ verbs primarily profile the agent and the effect of the activity on the agent (rather than on the patient), and this is what allows them to be used in intransitive as well as transitive constructions ([Newman 2009](Source#cldf:Newman2009):5, [Næss 2009](Source#cldf:Nss2009):27–28).

In some languages this distinction is carried further, as there are separate verbs for transitive ‘eat (something specified)’ and intransitive ‘eat’ (where what is eaten remains unprofiled) ([Newman 2009](Source#cldf:Newman2009):4, [Næss 2009](Source#cldf:Nss2009):29). One may say, with [Newman](Source#cldf:Newman2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Newman2009):5), that these reflect different conceptualisations of the ingestion activity, one which includes the ingested patient in its semantic profile (the transitive) and one which excludes it and profiles only the activity of ingestion (the intransitive). There are a number of Oceanic languages which have separate verbs for transitive and intransitive ‘eat’. The forms of these pairs of verbs are cognate with each other, and so it may be inferred that Proto Oceanic also made this distinction. Proto Malayo-Polynesian distinguished between transitive forms which consisted of the root plus a suffix or prefix, and an intransitive form with an actor subject. The intransitive form was marked with the prefix _&ast;paN-_, where _&ast;-N-_ combined with the root-initial consonant to produce a nasal consonant. Although there are several reconstructed Proto Oceanic verbs that include a reflex of intransitive _&ast;paN-_, just one of these reconstructed verbs with _&ast;paN-_ forms a pair with a corresponding reconstructed transitive. This is the pair meaning ‘eat’, POc _&ast;paŋan_ ‘eat’ (VI) vs _&ast;kani_ ‘eat’ (VT). They reflect the Proto Malayo-Polynesian forms _&ast;paŋan_ ‘eat (VI)’ and _&ast;kaen-i_ ‘eat (VT), where _&ast;paŋan_ is derived from _&ast;paN-_ + the root _&ast;kaen_ ‘eat’,[^3] and _&ast;kaen-i_ includes the location undergoer voice suffix _&ast;-i_, which became the POc transitive suffix _&ast;-i_.

As the data above are from primary subgroups of Oceanic, this intransitive/transitive pair evidently occurred in Proto Oceanic. The fact that this appears to be the only intransitive/ transitive pair retained in modern Oceanic languages reflects the tendency for languages to encode intransitive and transitive ‘eat’ separately. This in turn reflects the centrality of eating in human life.

The forms _&ast;paŋan_ and _&ast;kani_ are treated separately below, as in many Oceanic languages one of them has displaced the other. More frequently, _&ast;kani_ has replaced _&ast;paŋan_. The latter is not reflected at all (with the exception of certain forms described below) in New Guinea Oceanic (NNG and PT), Northwest Solomonic, North/Central Vanuatu, Central Pacific or Micronesian.

People in traditional Oceanic-speaking villages ate one cooked meal a day, usually after the day’s work, and this presumably was also true of POc speakers. The meal typically consisted of starchy staples, made more appetising by the addition of coconut milk, leafy vegetables and sometimes some meat or fish ([vol.3:36](ContributionTable?anchor=p-36#cldf:3-2)). The lexicons of Oceanic languages thus usually distinguish two main categories of ingredient, and POc evidently did so too. The relevant terms are:

-    POc _&ast;kanaŋ_: starchy staples, including yams, taro, sweet potatoes and other root crops,
     cooking bananas and breadfruit ([vol.3:40](ContributionTable?anchor=p-40#cldf:3-2)–41);
-    POc _&ast;tamaji_: the additional ingredients: coconut milk, leafy vegetables and protein foods
     (meat, fish, shellfish) ([vol.3:43](ContributionTable?anchor=p-43#cldf:3-2)).

The general meaning of _&ast;paŋan_ and _&ast;kani_ was ‘eat’, but Ross ([vol.3:36](ContributionTable?anchor=p-36#cldf:3-2)–40) concludes that they also had the specific meaning ‘eat starchy staples’. There are three kinds of evidence for this. First, _&ast;kanaŋ_ ‘starchy staples’ is a nominalisation of the base also found in _&ast;kani_. Secondly, in Oceanic languages for which there is detailed information about verbs of eating, there is usually at least one other ‘eat’ verb, with the meaning ‘eat starch and protein food together’. Sometimes there is also a verb meaning ‘eat meat’, ‘eat fish’ or ‘eat protein food’ and less often one meaning ‘eat greens alone’ or ‘eat (s.t.) as an accompaniment to starchy food’ ([vol.3:39](ContributionTable?anchor=p-39#cldf:3-2)–41). Significantly, however, there is almost never a separate verb meaning ‘eat starchy food’, implying that this was the more specific sense of _&ast;paŋan_/_&ast;kani_. Thirdly, on the rare occasions that a verb meaning ‘eat starch’ is found, it is the general verb of eating combined with an element indicating that nothing else (other than starch) is eaten, e.g. Anejom (SV) _topʷ-haŋ_ ‘eat starch without additions’, literally ‘just eat’, where _topʷ_ means ‘only’ and _haŋ_ is the general verb ‘eat’ (< POc _&ast;paŋan_); Arosi (SES) _ŋau-koŋari_ ‘eat one thing without relish’, where _ŋau_ is the general verb ‘eat’ (< POc _&ast;ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’, [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).2) and _koŋari_ is ‘empty’.


<a id="p-226"></a>

There is a semantic association whereby terms for ‘sharp’ (referring to a blade, not a point) are derived from the verb ‘eat’ or ‘chew’. Reflexes of _&ast;paŋan_, often reduplicated, mean ‘sharp’ in a number of Meso-Melanesian and Southeast Solomonic languages, while reflexes of _&ast;kani_ mean ‘sharp’ in a number of Northwest Solomonic, Micronesian and Polynesian languages. Isolated instances also occur in reflexes of the verbs of gnawing _&ast;ŋau_ (Kwaio) and _&ast;ŋas(i,u)_ (Hoava, Vangunu) ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).2). Although this semantic extension of ‘eat’ seems rather an obvious one, it is not among those listed as occurring crosslinguistically by [Newman](Source#cldf:Newman2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Newman2009)).

A number of the reflexes of _&ast;paŋan_ with the sense ‘sharp’ display reduplication. This appears to have been an early Oceanic strategy for forming adjectives from members of other word classes. Colour adjectives, for example, were often reduplicated nouns ([vol.2:207](ContributionTable?anchor=p-207#cldf:2-7)–210). This strategy did not occur with reflexes of _&ast;kani_ that mean ‘sharp’, evidently because reduplication formed actor-subject intransitive verbs from transitives.

[PMP &ast;_paŋan_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-226-POc-paan-a)


<a id="p-227"></a>

As noted above, reduplication forms actor-subject intransitive verbs from transitives, and there are a few reflexes of a possible POc _&ast;kani-kani_ (VI) ‘eat’, namely Motu _ɣani-ɣani_, Nakanai _al-ali_, Hahon _an-an_, Lungga _ɣa-ɣani_, West Guadalcanal _ɣa-ɣani_, Tamambo _hani-hani_ — but only the Motu and Tamambo forms are clearly marked as intransitive in the sources. Madak _an-an_ and Barok _a-an_, both ‘sharp’, are exceptions to the generalisation above that adjectives are not formed from transitive verbs by reduplication. However, both sets of reduplicated forms here may be the result of post-Proto Oceanic applications of productive reduplication rules, rather than reflexes of reduplicated Proto Oceanic forms. It seems a little unlikely that a putative POc †_&ast;kani-kani_ (VI) ‘eat’ competed with _&ast;paŋan_ (VI) ‘eat’.

<a id="p-229"></a>

PPn _&ast;kai_ ‘eat’ below reflects irregular loss of POc _&ast;-n-_.

[PPn &ast;_kai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-229-PPn-kai-a)


<a id="p-230"></a>

There is a small collection of oddments derived from _&ast;paŋan_ which do not fit into the cognate sets above. The most intriguing of these is Arosi (SES) _maŋa_ (VI) ‘eat’, (N) ‘bits of food in the crevices of the teeth after eating’. It appears to reflect PMP _&ast;maŋan_ ([Blust 1983](Source#cldf:Blust1983)-84), the independent intransitive form corresponding with dependent PAn _&ast;paŋan_ (cf [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5). Only a few Proto Malayo-Polynesian independent intransitive forms survived into Proto Oceanic, and the history of this form (and why there is just one known Oceanic reflex) is a mystery.

Less mysterious are PROc _&ast;va-vaŋan-i_ (VT) ‘feed’ and PPn _&ast;fāŋai_ ‘feed, provide food for’, both causative verbs with a root reflecting POc _&ast;paŋan_ (VI) ‘eat’. It happens that the POc causative prefix was _&ast;pa-_, giving a causative form _&ast;pa-paŋan-i_, where _&ast;-i_ was the transitive suffix. The suffix is reflected in Wayan and also accounts (i) for the retention of root-final _-n_ in Mota, which would have been lost if it was word-final and (ii) for the final _&ast;-i_ of PPn _&ast;fāŋai_. It appears that the repeated syllable _&ast;pa-_ has been reduced by haplology in Mota and Rotuman, perhaps because reflexes of the root _&ast;paŋan_ have no function in these languages outside the causative (as noted above, in the sense ‘eat’ reflexes of the root _&ast;paŋan_ have been replaced by reflexes of &ast;kani). PPn _&ast;fāŋai_ reflects two idiosyncratic innovations. The first is the replacement of †_&ast;fafa-_ by _&ast;fā-_. The second is the loss of POc _&ast;-n-_, already noted above with regard to PPn _&ast;kai_ ‘eat’.

[PROc &ast;_va-vaŋan-i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-230-PROc-vavaani-a)

It was remarked above that POc _&ast;paŋan_ and _&ast;kani_ both probably had ‘eat starchy food’ as their more specific meaning. Modern Oceanic languages typically have at least one other ‘eat’ verb, with the meaning ‘eat starch and protein food together’. As the sample below shows, reconstruction of the POc term is impossible, but the concept must have been lexicalised in POc.


<a id="p-231"></a>

[5-4-3-1-231-nng-maposbuang-rm](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-231-nng-maposbuang-rm)

Also widespread is the concept ‘eat meat/fish alone’:

[5-4-3-1-231-nng-labu-hugu](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-231-nng-labu-hugu)

The concept ‘eat meat/fish alone’ was possibly already lexicalised in POc, as _&ast;[q,k]oda(q)_, but meaning occurs only in Roviana (MM) and as a subsidiary meaning in Wayan Fijian. More usually the reflexes mean ‘eat s.t. raw’, where the ‘something’ seems most frequently to be meat or fish (contra the gloss ‘raw seafood; eat raw seafood’ in [vol.4:438](ContributionTable?anchor=p-438#cldf:4-8), footnote 6).

[PAn &ast;_qetaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-231-POc-qkodaq-a)


<a id="p-232"></a>

Meat or fish was a less frequent food ingredient than starchy staples, but it was clearly valued, as the occurrence of verbs meaning ‘crave for meat/fish’ indicates:

[5-4-3-1-232-pt-iduna-onanaga](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-232-pt-iduna-onanaga)

Terms for ‘eat greens alone’ are rarer, probably reflecting the fact that Oceanic speakers rarely eat leafy vegetables without any other food:

[5-4-3-1-232-mm-ramoaaina-odo](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-232-mm-ramoaaina-odo)

PPn _&ast;samu_ seems to have meant something like ‘eat one food only’, and in Nuclear Polynesian (reflexes other than Tongan and Niuean) ‘eat protein food only’. If the Gedaged terms below are cognate, then POc _&ast;samu_ is reconstructable, perhaps with the sense ‘eat food that adds relish to staples’. In the Gedaged area this typically consists of green vegetables, with a small quantity of fish as a possible addition.

[5-4-3-1-232-nng-gedaged-same](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-232-nng-gedaged-same)

[PPn &ast;_samu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-232-PPn-samu-a)

It is difficult to know if POc _&ast;kamu_ meant more than just ‘eat’. The reflexes below that are glossed ‘chew (betelnut)’ all occur in the Southeast Solomonic area, and the Rennellese and Tikopia terms must be borrowings from a Southeast Solomonic language as betelnut has never been a part of Polynesian culture.

#### 3.1.2. Chewing and then eating, gnawing


Chewing is conceptualised in many Oceanic languages as two separate activities: chewing with the intention of eating, and chewing something of which the residue will afterwards be spat out. The object of the latter, either implied or specified, is typically sugarcane or betelnut. This section is concerned with chewing and eating, whilst chewing without eating is discussed in [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).3.

[Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994b) ([1994b](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1994b)) and Ross, Clark and Osmond ([vol.1:238](ContributionTable?anchor=p-238#cldf:1-9)) comment on the phonaesthetic pattern _&ast;kʷV[r,R,s]V-_[^5] in POc terms meaning ‘scrape’. A similar pattern, but with initial _&ast;ŋ-_, appears to be present in chewing verbs such as POc _&ast;ŋari(s)_, _&ast;ŋaris-i-_ ‘gnaw, of animals’ in this section and POc _&ast;ŋasu_ (VI), _&ast;ŋasi_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut, sugarcane), bite into’ and PNNG _&ast;ŋuru_ ‘chew (sugarcane)’ in [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).3, as well as a multiplicity of similar but not fully cognate forms which are listed under ‘cf. also’ beneath the _&ast;ŋari(s)_/_&ast;ŋaris-i-_ and _&ast;ŋas_ (VI)/_&ast;ŋas-i_ (VT) sets. The primary chew-and-eat verb POc _&ast;ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’ also begins with _&ast;ŋ-_.

Two POc verb roots are reconstructed for ‘chew and eat’, _&ast;ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’ and POc _&ast;ŋari(s)_ ‘gnaw’, _&ast;ŋaris-i-_ ‘gnaw (s.t.), of animals’. The semantic distinction is clear in Polynesian reflexes where &ast;ŋari- terms refer to gnawing or nibbling by animals, particularly rats, while reflexes of &ast;ŋau refer to human chewing/eating. A number of reflexes of the latter have become a general term for ‘eat’.

<a id="s-3-1-3"></a>

#### 3.1.3. Chewing without swallowing


Seven terms are reconstructed for chewing without swallowing:

 1.   POc _&ast;ŋas_ (VI), _&ast;ŋas-i-_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut), suck and chew (sugarcane), bite into’
 2.   PNNG _&ast;ŋuru_ ‘suck and chew (sugarcane)’
 3.   POc _&ast;qusi-_ ‘suck and chew (sugarcane)’
 4.   POc _&ast;mamaq_ (VI), _&ast;mamaq-i-_ (VT) ‘chew, masticate but not swallow’
 5.   POc _&ast;meme_ (VI), _&ast;[me]me-i-_ (VT) ‘premasticate food for baby’
 6.   POc _&ast;jamu_ (VI), _&ast;jamʷ-i-_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut)’ ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):78)
 7.   ?? PEOc _&ast;dramu_ (VI), _&ast;dramʷ-i-_ (VT) ‘chew’

With so many POc terms for the same or similar activities, one would expect them to have had different uses. Among the glosses of their reflexes one can distinguish general terms that make no reference to what is chewed, specialist terms used for chewing betelnut or sugarcane, and terms that refer to premasticating food for a baby. However, it is difficult to attribute specific meanings to the POc reconstructions because reflexes have undergone meaning shifts. A small complication is that ‘chew betelnut’ was a meaning in the wordlists elicited by Ross, but it is possible that terms thus glossed are also used for other kinds of chewing.

Betelnut chewing is singled out in many Oceanic languages because of its social significance. Betelnut is a stimulant, _Areca catechu_, POc _&ast;buaq_ ([vol.3:391](ContributionTable?anchor=p-391#cldf:3-13)–395), chewed throughout lowland New Guinea and NW Island Melanesia.

> Palms are grown in village groves or singly near houses. The seed may be chewed alone, but usually people chew a quid consisting of the seed, lime and a catkin or leaf of _Piper betle_ [POc _&ast;[pu-]pulu_] …. Chewing the seed induces salivation, and if lime is present it turns the chewed mass bright red. Some people swallow all but the initial burst of saliva, whilst others spit out the red masticate. Initially, chewing leads to a very short-lived dizziness, followed by a sense of renewed wakefulness. In Papua New Guinea and parts of the Solomons chewing betelnut is a social ritual when people meet. Convention requires that the host offer betelnut to visitors …. ([vol.3:392](ContributionTable?anchor=p-392#cldf:3-13))

So ‘chewing betelnut’ entails a semantic frame which includes not only the physical practices but also the assertion of social solidarity associated with chewing.

Betelnut is not chewed in Vanuatu, Fiji, Polynesia or Micronesia, where a similar social function is performed by kava-drinking (kava is made from _Piper methysticum_).

Another common activity in NW Melanesian villages is chewing a piece of sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_, POc _&ast;topu_ ([vol.3:389](ContributionTable?anchor=p-389#cldf:3-13)–391).

> The jointed, fibrous stalks contain sucrose, obtained by cutting off a stem and chopping it into convenient lengths which are sucked and chewed as a refreshing snack. When the sugar has been sucked out, the rubbish is spat out. ([vol.3:390](ContributionTable?anchor=p-390#cldf:3-13))

It has proven easier to identify POc terms for chewing sugarcane than for chewing betelnut.


<a id="p-236"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;ŋas_/_&ast;ŋas-i-_ and _&ast;mamaq_/_&ast;mamaq-i-_ are geographically interlaced in the North New Guinea and Meso-Melanesian clusters of Western Oceanic,[^6] whilst the former prevails in Southeast Solomonic, the latter in Vanuatu and the Central Pacific. It is difficult to infer a difference in meaning between them from the glosses of their reflexes. Glosses of the reflexes of _&ast;ŋas_/_&ast;ŋas-i-_ refer to both betelnut and sugarcane, but the term has reflexes only in the betelnut-chewing region, suggesting that it was used mainly of chewing betelnut. Glosses of Western Oceanic reflexes of _&ast;mamaq_/_&ast;mamaq-i-_ refer only to betelnut-chewing, but there are also reflexes outside the betelnut-chewing region, which tend to denote chewing without swallowing and in NCV and Polynesian sometimes refer specifically to premasticating food to be fed to a baby.

If the canonic derivation of POc verbs from PMP reduplicated monosyllables is applied ([Blust 1977b](Source#cldf:Blust1977b); see also [vol.2:25](ContributionTable?anchor=p-25#cldf:2-2)) to _&ast;ŋas_/_&ast;ŋas-i-_, the expected intransitive form is †_&ast;ŋa-ŋas_, but this is nowhere reflected, perhaps because the verb’s general meaning typically required an object specifying what was chewed. However, Banoni and Maringe ŋasa both reflect the Proto NW Solomonic final echo vowel _&ast;-a_, pointing to an earlier intransitive _&ast;ŋas_.

It is tempting to attribute Hoava _ŋahu_ and Vangunu _ŋasu_, both ‘sharp’ (under ‘cf. also’ below), to this set, extending the observation that words for ‘sharp’ are sometimes derived from eating verbs ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1). However, two features speak against this. First, _&ast;ŋasi-_ is not semantically a verb of eating. Second, final _-u_ is non-etymological. From this perspective, Mono-Alu _asu_ ‘chew (betelnut)’ is also not a regular reflex of POc _&ast;ŋas_ or _&ast;ŋasi-_. Loss of initial _&ast;ŋ-_ is regular, but final _-u_ appears to reflect blending of regular pre-Mono-Alu †_&ast;ŋasa_ (the expected reflex of POc _&ast;ŋas_) with a reflex of putative _&ast;ŋasu_ ‘sharp’ (of unknown antiquity).

Blust (ACD) offers evidence that Proto Malayo-Polynesian had a term referring specifically to chewing sugarcane. As Oceanic evidence he offers just the Mota reflex, and we have found one further Oceanic cognate.

POc _&ast;mamaq_ (VI), _&ast;mamaq-i-_ (VT) is reconstructed with final _&ast;-q_ on the basis of Tolai, Minigir, Label and Siar _-i_ and Namakir _-ʔ_.

[PMP &ast;_mamaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-238-POc-mamaq-a)


<a id="p-239"></a>

Vanuatu reflexes of POc _&ast;meme_ (VI), _&ast;[me]me-i-_ (VT) have the very specific meaning ‘premasticate food for baby’, where the baby is the object of the transitive form. However, inspection of the glosses below and the glosses of reflexes of POc &ast;mamaq ‘chew betelnut’ above suggests that there has been some blending of the two terms, whereby one of the two verbs also takes on the meaning of the other. It seems likely that Vanuatu reflexes preserve the POc sense, since there is no other POc candidate for the meaning ‘premasticate food for baby’. No reflex from outside Vanuatu with this meaning has been found.

[POc &ast;_meme_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-1-239-POc-meme-a)

POc _&ast;jamu_ perhaps meant ‘chew (betelnut)’, as this is its meaning throughout the betelnut-chewing area. Beyond this area it retains senses related to the fibrous residue remaining after a plant has been chewed or wrung out. PNCV _&ast;zamʷan_ ‘chew, fibrous residue’ appears to have been a noun reflecting the POc nominalisation _&ast;jamu-an_, suggesting that the meaning of the verb at an immediately pre-PNCV stage was something like ‘spit out residue’, a meaning which is, however, not directly attested. In fact even the verbs in some, if not all, Vanuatu languages listed appear to be back-formations from the nominalisation. Mota _samʷan_, Kiai _zama-i-_, Uripiv _o-jəm-jəmʷe_, Ninde _samʷe_, Rerep _jamue_, Nguna _samʷa-e_ all appear to reflect the suffix _&ast;-an_ (_&ast;-n_ is mostly lost in NCV languages).

It is tempting to try to associate POc _&ast;jamu_ with _&ast;d(r)amut_ ‘lime spatula’ ([vol.1:77](ContributionTable?anchor=p-77#cldf:1-4)), as the latter belongs to the paraphernalia of betel-chewing, but the resemblance seems to be a chance one.

PPn _&ast;samu_ ‘eat scraps’ has the same form as PPn _&ast;samu_ ‘eat one food only’ ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1), but this is also apparently a chance resemblance.

The set below appears to reflect an earlier intransitive, POc _&ast;ñamu_, corresponding to POc _&ast;jamu_ in the same way as POc _&ast;paŋan_ (VI) ‘eat’ corresponds to _&ast;kani_ (VT) ‘eat’. Blust (ACD) notes a corresponding Javanese pair, _ñamuk-ñamuk_ (VI)/_camuk-camuk_ (VT) ‘chew on something with the mouth full’.

Tentatively reconstructed PEOc _&ast;dramu_ (VI), _&ast;dramʷ-i-_ (VT) ‘chew’ below is suspect because the SE Solomonic reflexes other than Gela _dami_ could equally well reflect POc _&ast;jamu_ (VI), _&ast;jamʷ-i-_ (VT). The reflexes of PPn _&ast;lamu_ ‘chew’, however, are clearly distinct from those of PPn _&ast;samu_ ‘eat scraps’.

### 3.2. Drinking and sucking


The verbs reconstructed in this section denote the ingestion of liquids. Like eating ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1), drinking in general was evidently expressed in Proto Oceanic by a pair of verbs, intransitive and transitive. There were evidently two lexically encoded manners of drinking. One entailed opening the mouth and pouring liquid from a vessel (often a young coconut) which did not touch the lips ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).1.1). The other involved contact between the lips and the drinking vessel and translates roughly as sipping and slurping ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).1.2).

Sucking for Proto Oceanic speakers was perhaps not one category but three or four: sucking other than at the mother’s breast in order to drink ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).2), sucking at the mother’s breast ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).3), sucking at a pipe in order to inhale its smoke ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).4), and making sucking noises (in [§4.3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-6#cldf:5-4) below). The glosses of sucking verbs often include ‘kiss’, for which Proto Oceanic appears not to have had a dedicated term. The Oceanic way of greeting is or was by pressing the nose to face or limb and sniffing, an action often described as kissing (see POc _&ast;asok_ (VI) _&ast;asok-i_ (VT) ‘sniff’ in [§8.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-4#cldf:5-4)).


<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Drinking



<a id="p-242"></a>

Just as a pair of Proto Oceanic verbs _&ast;paŋan_ and _&ast;kani-_, respectively intransitive and transitive ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1), can be reconstructed for ‘eat’, so too a pair can be reconstructed for ‘drink’: _&ast;mʷinum_ (VI) and _&ast;inum-i-_ (VT) (cf [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5). Unlike terms for ‘eat’, reflexes of the two ‘drink’ verbs appear never to co-occur in an Oceanic language as an intransitive/transitive pair, and in many languages we find either that a new transitive has been formed from a reflex of intransitive _&ast;mʷinum_ or that a new intransitive has been back-formed from transitive _&ast;inum-i-_, giving intransitive _&ast;inum_. Reflexes of the intransitive and transitive do occur, however, in closely related languages. Thus Bauan Fijian ŋunu/ŋunuv- reflects _&ast;mʷinum_, whilst Boumaa Fijian inu/inum- reflects _&ast;inum-i-_.

The derivation of the ‘drink’ pair is different from the ‘eat’ pair. The Proto Malayo-Polynesian intransitive of ‘eat’ was formed with _&ast;paN-_, whereas the intransitive of ‘drink’ was formed with a prefix allomorph of the PMP infix _&ast;⟨um⟩_, giving _&ast;um-inum_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5). Non-Oceanic languages have sometimes lost initial _&ast;u-_ (e.g. Malay minum), but there is evidence that it was still present at an immediately pre-Proto Oceanic stage, as it caused labialisation of _&ast;m-_, giving POc _&ast;mʷinum_ rather than _&ast;minum_ ([Lynch 2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)). This is attested both by reflexes that retain _mʷi-_ and by those that have simplified _&ast;mʷi-_ to mu-.

[PMP &ast;_um-inum_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-242-POc-minum-a)

[PMP &ast;_inum_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-242-POc-inum-a)


<a id="p-243"></a>


<a id="p-244"></a>

A good many reflexes of POc _&ast;inum_/_&ast;inumi_ have replaced initial _&ast;i-_ with _u-_. This is probably the result of anticipating the stressed vowel in _&ast;inúmi_, but may also reflect early analogy with the intransitive form, i.e. _&ast;mʷinum_ > _&ast;munum_, then by analogy _&ast;inum_ > _&ast;unum_. Because reflexes with _u-_ are readily explained and occur at scattered locations (in languages of East Nusantara as well as in Oceanic; ACD), we take them to reflect idiosyncratic local changes and do not reconstruct POc †_&ast;unum_.[^9] These reflexes are:

[5-4-3-2-244-adm-seimat-un](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-244-adm-seimat-un)

A number of reflexes of _&ast;inum_/_&ast;inumi_ have acquired an initial onset consonant, usually _ɣ-_ or _ʔ-_, bringing them into line with the consonant-initial majority of roots. Again, these appear to be local developments.

##### 3.2.1.1. Pouring down the throat


A common Melanesian way of drinking, especially from a young coconut with a hole in the shell, is to tip one’s head back, mouth open, and to pour the coconut water down the throat without the lips touching the coconut. There is evidence that Proto Oceanic speakers had a verb for this action, apparently with the form _&ast;gʷagʷa_ or _&ast;gʷaŋʷa_. The first form is reflected in Tawala (PT), Hahon and Teop (MM, NW Solomonic), the latter by Sursurunga and Siar (MM, South New Ireland) and Gela (SES). The forms from Solos to Gela all reflect initial _&ast;(k,kʷ)-_, suggesting that the form may have been _&ast;kʷagʷa_ or _&ast;kʷaŋʷa_. It is possible that the Proto Oceanic form continues PMP _&ast;kaŋa_ ‘be open, as the mouth’ and that the labialisation of the consonants is an Oceanic development, perhaps onomatopoeic. If so, then the Proto Oceanic form was presumably _&ast;kʷaŋʷa_ or _&ast;gʷaŋʷa_.[^10]

Because this was a traditional manner of drinking, it is unsurprising that a number of reflexes below have the simple gloss ‘drink’.

The items under ‘cf. also’ are listed because it is remotely possible that they are somehow related to the POc form. The two MM forms are from Santa Isabel languages, i.e. very close to Bugotu, and are probably borrowed from there.

##### 3.2.1.2. Sipping and slurping


The terms reconstructed below refer to drinking from a spoon or bowl and contrast semantically with the style of drinking denoted by POc _&ast;(gʷ,kʷ)a(gʷ,ŋʷ)a_ ‘drink by pouring down the throat’ in [§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).1.1.

Despite the formal and semantic similarities between POc _&ast;iRup_/_&ast;iRup-i-_ ‘sip (as soup), slurp’ and POc _&ast;soRop_/_&ast;soRop-i-_ ‘absorb (liquid), suck up (liquid), sip, slurp’ ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).2), the terms have separate origins.

<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Sucking-and-drinking


It was mentioned in [§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4) that what in European languages is classed as ‘sucking’ evidently fell into several categories in Proto Oceanic, and continues to do so in modern Oceanic languages. This section is concerned with verbs whose primary meaning is to suck in order to drink. These verbs are often also used figuratively of inanimate substances with the sense ‘absorb (liquid)’.

Three terms reconstructed below, POc _&ast;ñoñop_/_&ast;ñop-i-_ ‘put the face against, kiss, suck, sniff’, POc _&ast;ñosop_ ‘suck (?)’ and POc _&ast;sosop_/_&ast;sop-i-_ ‘put lips to, kiss, suck, absorb (moisture)’ are almost certainly derivationally related. The basic PMP form was _&ast;sepsep_, which by Blust’s (1977) ‘comparative paradigm’ became POc _&ast;sosop_ (VI), _&ast;sop-i-_ (VT). However, parallel with derivation of the intransitive/transitive pair _&ast;paŋan_/_&ast;kani_ ‘eat’ ([§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).1), PMP would have formed an intransitive/transitive pair &ast;(pa)ñepsep (_&ast;paN_ + _&ast;sepsep_)/_&ast;sepsep_, the first member of which is reflected in Baegu, To’aba’ita and Lau below. Initial _&ast;pa-_ was lost or was perhaps never present (as in Malay and other languages of western Indonesia), giving POc intransitive _&ast;ñosop_ (reflected in Lau _noso_). With the collapse of the intransitive/transitive morphological contrast in early Oceanic, a new transitive was formed from the resulting disyllable, PSES _&ast;nosov-i_, the direct ancestor of the Baegu, To’aba’ita and Lau transitive forms. Somewhere in the Malayo-Polynesian dialects ancestral to Proto Oceanic _&ast;sepsep_ also gave rise to a monosyllabic base _&ast;sep_, from which was formed the intransitive &ast;(pa)ñep, giving pre-POc _&ast;ñop_, from which by analogy POc _&ast;ñoñop_ was created, followed by a transitive derivation in some daughter-languages.


<a id="p-247"></a>

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;ñepñep_, but it has few non-Oceanic reflexes, and it seems likely that the process just described occurred independently in different languages where the systematic morphological relationship between intransitive (_&ast;paN-_ + root) and transitive (reduplicated root) had been lost.

[PMP &ast;_sepsep_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-247-POc-sosop-a)


<a id="p-248"></a>

The glosses below indicate that making a noise while drawing in liquid or breath was an element of the meaning of POc _&ast;soRop_/_&ast;soRop-i-_, and the Sursurunga gloss ‘sniffle’ suggests that this could occur with the nose as well as with the mouth. This is presumably the basis for NCV shifts in meaning to ‘snort’, ‘snore’, ‘grunt’, and ‘growl’. Bugotu and Gela soropi below are almost certainly borrowed from a NW Solomonic language, as the expected reflex is †_solo_/_solov-i-_. The items listed under ‘cf. also’ reflect an unexplained initial _&ast;t-_ rather than _&ast;s-_.

[PMP &ast;_seRep_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-248-POc-sorop-a)


<a id="p-249"></a>

The POc terms _&ast;tumu_ ‘suck’ and _&ast;dumu_(s)/_&ast;dumus-i-_ ‘suck on, suck up (liquid)’ below evidently denoted sucking and drinking, but we are not able to infer how they may have differed in meaning from the terms above.

[POc &ast;_tumu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-249-POc-tumu-a)

[POc &ast;_dumu(s)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-249-POc-dumus-a)

PNCV _&ast;zimi_ ‘sip, suck, taste’, PPn _&ast;ŋoŋo_ ‘suck liquid from a container’ and PPn _&ast;momi_ ‘swallow, suck’ are more localised terms for sucking in liquid.

[PNCV &ast;_zimi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-249-PNCV-zimi-a)

Comparison of the Wayan Fijian term _omi-_ (under ‘cf. also’) with PPn _&ast;momi_ suggests that a POc pair _&ast;m-omi_ (VI)/_&ast;omi-_ (VT) may have occurred, with an origin analogous to that of POc _&ast;mʷinum_ (VI)/_&ast;inum-i-_ (VT) ‘drink’ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5), but there is no solid evidence to support this conjecture.

#### 3.2.3. Sucking the breast and suckling


POc apparently had a pair of near homophones for ‘suck (the breast)’, namely _&ast;susup_ (VI), _&ast;susup-i-_ (VT) and _&ast;susu_ (VI), _&ast;susu-i-_ (VT). POc _&ast;susup_ continues an etymon of PAn antiquity. POc _&ast;susu_ is the root that also occurs as _&ast;susu-_ ‘breast, milk’ ([§3.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-7#cldf:5-4)). The forms are so similar that it is tempting to try to combine them into a single cognate set, but the differing transitive forms do not allow this. At the same time, in languages where word-final consonants are lost it is impossible to determine whether the intransitive form reflects _&ast;susup_ or _&ast;susu_.

The set below reflects POc _&ast;susup_ (VI), _&ast;susup-i-_ (VT) ‘suck (the breast)’. In each language the transitive suffix _&ast;-i-_ has prevented loss of the root-final consonant, so that the reflex of root-final _&ast;-p-_ attests that this is a reflex of _&ast;susup_.

[PAn &ast;_supsup_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-250-POc-susup-a)

The next set reflects POc _&ast;susu_ (VI), _&ast;susu-i-_ (VT) ‘suck (the breast)’. We know this either because _&ast;-p_ is absent in the transitive form or because — in the Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian languages listed below — if POc word-final _&ast;-p_ had been present it would have been retained (as it is in reflexes of _&ast;mawap_ ‘yawn’; cf. [§4.5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5-6#cldf:5-4)).


<a id="p-251"></a>

[PMP &ast;_susu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-251-POc-susu-a)

The remaining reflexes, listed below, could reflect either etymon, and one can reasonably infer that in many Oceanic languages reflexes of POc _&ast;susup_ and _&ast;susu_ were conflated as a single item when final-consonant loss took place.

[POc &ast;_susup_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-2-251-POc-susup-a)


<a id="p-252"></a>

The POc terms for ‘suckle, feed (baby) at the breast’ were _&ast;pa-susup-i-_ or _&ast;pa-susu-i-_, literally ‘cause to suck’, formed with POc _&ast;pa-_ CAUSATIVE. Conflation of _&ast;susup_ and _&ast;susu_ is probably also reflected here, and some of the terms listed under POc _&ast;pa-susu_ may in fact reflect intransitive _&ast;pa-susup_.

It was noted in [§4.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-2#cldf:5-4).4 that POc _&ast;pasu_[su] ‘give birth’ bears a striking resemblance to POc _&ast;pa-susu_ ‘suckle’, but concluded that the two POc forms were not (or were no longer) related.

#### 3.2.4. Sucking at a pipe to inhale smoke


The reconstruction of PEOc _&ast;komu_ (VI), _&ast;komi_ ‘suck at (a pipe)’ is somewhat tentative, as SE Solomonic reflexes except Bauro omu (listed by [Fox 1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) end in _-e_ or _-i_, presumably a transitive formative, whereas the Polynesian reflexes end in _-o_ rather than _u_. However, the shared sense of sucking on a pipe implies cognacy.

### 3.3. Being hungry, thirsty, replete



<a id="s-3-3-1"></a>

#### 3.3.1. Being hungry


POc _&ast;pitolon_ seems originally to have been a noun meaning ‘famine’ or ‘hunger’, derived from PMP _&ast;bitil-en_, where _&ast;-en_ is a nominaliser. The existence of Tuam, Malai, Lukep _pitola_, Malasanga _butola_, all with final _-a_, suggests that POc may also have had the alternant _&ast;pitolan_, from PMP _&ast;bitil-an_, where _&ast;-an_ is also a nominaliser. However, in POc _&ast;pitolon_ appears already to have been used as an adjective or stative verb as well.[^12]

POc also had the term _&ast;mʷalum_, with a meaning similar to that of _&ast;pitolon_.

<a id="p-254"></a>

[POc &ast;_mʷalum_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-3-254-POc-malum-a)

In certain Central Pacific languages the term for ‘be hungry’ is an expression meaning ‘wants to eat’ (cf. ‘want to drink’ for ‘thirsty’ and ‘want to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’; [§4.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-3#cldf:5-4).2, [§6.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-1#cldf:5-4)).

[PCP &ast;_via kani_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-3-254-PCP-viakani-a)

A similar locution is reflected in the Mengen languages of SE New Britain, where the term for ‘want’ reflects _&ast;mate_ ‘die’ ([§2.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1-2#cldf:5-4)):

<a id="s-3-3-2"></a>

#### 3.3.2. Being thirsty


The root of POc _&ast;[ma]raqu_ ‘be thirsty’ reflects PMP _&ast;laqu_ ‘thirst, hunger’. Unprefixed POc _&ast;raqu_ has just one known reflex, namely Sio _rako-ña_.[^14] [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs the alternative PNCV forms _&ast;marou_ and _&ast;madou_. These appear to reflect forms with different POc prefixes, namely _&ast;ma-raqu_ and _&ast;madraqu_, the latter from _&ast;maN-raqu_. It is difficult to determine exactly what the difference in meaning might have been. POc _&ast;ma-raqu_ would have meant ‘be thirsty, become thirsty’. The presence of _&ast;maN-_ in _&ast;madraqu_ implies some agentivity on the part of the subject, as in English ‘work up a thirst’ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).6).

Blust reconstructs PWMP _&ast;laqu_, implying an expected POc root †_&ast;laqu_, but the data unanimously support POc _&ast;raqu_.

[POc &ast;_madraqu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-3-256-POc-madraqu-a)

A good number of Oceanic languages express the concept of thirst phrasally, as they do for hunger, and we infer that this strategy may have been a POc alternative to the lexical items above. First, Central Pacific languages and certain others reflect an expression that means ‘want to drink’ (cf. ‘want to eat’ for ‘hungry’ and ‘want to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’; [§3.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-1#cldf:5-4), [§4.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-2#cldf:5-4).1)

[PCP &ast;_via inu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-3-256-PCP-viainu-a)

Second, a number of languages use a body-part expression (cf [§9.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-3#cldf:5-4)) in which the body part is the neck or throat.

### 3.4. Swallowing


[Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2001d) ([2001d](Source#cldf:Lynch2001d)) draws attention to the strange collection of hypothetically reconstructable POc forms for ‘swallow’—strange because they don’t reflect reconstructed PMP regularly and because they form an unusually large set of apparent variations on a single template.

If it is assumed that every cognate set found reflects a POc form, then the hypothetically reconstructable POc forms are those shown in [Table 15](#table-15). We infer that _&ast;toŋol_ reflects metathesis of _&ast;toloŋ_ and treat these two forms together.

<a id="table-15"> </a>

|               | _&ast;p-_    | _&ast;t-_              | _&ast;d-_    | _&ast;k-_    | _&ast;s-_    |

| _&ast;-l-_, _&ast;-m_ | _&ast;polom_ | _&ast;tolom_           | _&ast;dolom_ | _&ast;kolom_ | —        |

Earlier reconstructed forms provide some insight into what has happened here. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PCEMP _&ast;belen_ ‘swallow’ and PMP _&ast;tilen_ ‘swallow’. These have final _&ast;-n_, whereas the possible POc forms tabulated above have _&ast;-ŋ_ or _&ast;-m_. This apparent idiosyncratic change requires an explanation. A search of the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) for earlier forms that match the possible POc forms in _&ast;-ŋ_ or _&ast;-m_ yields PMP _&ast;teleŋ_ and _&ast;telem_, both ‘sink, disappear under water’. Lynch suggests tentatively that the POc ‘swallow’ forms in _&ast;-ŋ_ or _&ast;-m_ reflect blends of earlier ‘swallow’ forms in _&ast;-n_ with ‘sink’ forms in _&ast;-ŋ_ or _&ast;-m_ or with _&ast;inem_ ‘drink’.[^16] This seems unlikely, however. When blends occur, there are typically reflexes that retain the meanings of both input forms, but no known Oceanic form for ‘swallow’ also means ‘sink’ or ‘drink’.[^17]


<a id="p-258"></a>

A more probable explanation is to be found in the earlier forms themselves: _&ast;belen_ ‘swallow’ and _&ast;tilen_ ‘swallow’ both end in _&ast;-len_, giving POc _&ast;-lon_. The POc consonants _&ast;l_ and _&ast;n_ both probably had an alveolar point of articulation, and the replacement of _&ast;-lon_ by _&ast;-loŋ_ or _&ast;-lom_ gave the final consonant a velar or bilabial articulation and thus increased its distinctiveness. Obviously, this explanation would be stronger if a parallel change were found in other morphemes. It isn’t. But there are no cases of _&ast;-lon_ amongst our POc reconstructions.

The fact that pre-Oceanic _&ast;belen_ ‘swallow’ and _&ast;tilen_ ‘swallow’ (both containing the early Austronesian root _&ast;-len_ ‘swallow’) have been reconstructed explains the distinction between the first and second columns of [Table 15](#table-15). Under the reasonable assumption that PCEMP _&ast;belen_ was reflected as POc _&ast;polo_(m), the only peculiarity about the set below is that it is restricted to Polynesia.

[PCEMP &ast;_belen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-258-POc-polom-a)

This brings us to the forms in the four rightmost columns of [Table 15](#table-15). Forms with initial _&ast;t-_ and _&ast;k-_ have one of three medial consonants: expected _&ast;-l-_ and unexpected _&ast;-n-_ or _&ast;-d-_. Forms with initial _&ast;d-_ have one of two medial consonants: expected _&ast;-l-_ and unexpected _&ast;-n-_. It is hardly likely that these forms all occurred in Proto Oceanic, unless a semantic factor like word taboo intervened, and there are no grounds to infer this. Instead, assuming for the moment that PMP _&ast;tilen_ ‘swallow’ gave rise to the Proto Oceanic alternants _&ast;tiloŋ_ and _&ast;tilom_, it seems likely from their sporadic distributions that replacements of _&ast;-l-_ by _&ast;-n-_ or _&ast;-d-_ happened independently at different places and times.


<a id="p-259"></a>

Why might these changes have occurred (and recurred)? Again, the reason perhaps has to do with the fact that _&ast;t-_ and _&ast;-l-_ had a similar point of articulation. But this cannot be the whole reason, as the resulting combinations in [Table 15](#table-15), e.g. _&ast;donom_, also have similar or identical points of articulation. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2000a) ([2000a](Source#cldf:Lynch2000a)) shows that stress in Proto Oceanic words fell on the penultimate mora, i.e. _&ast;tilóŋ_ and _&ast;tilóm_,[^18] and on transitives _&ast;tilóŋi_ and _&ast;tilómi_. Thus there would have been a strong tendency for the first syllable to be phonetically weakened or deleted, i.e. &ast;[t(ə)ˈloŋ], &ast;[t(ə)ˈlom], &ast;[t(ə)ˈloŋi] and &ast;[t(ə)ˈlomi], giving the initial cluster &ast;[tl] in some dialects. Possible articulatory outcomes would have been

 1. the extension of voicing to &ast;[t], i.e. &ast;[tl] > &ast;[dl];
 2. the nasalisation of &ast;[l] under the influence of &ast;[m], i.e. &ast;[tl] > &ast;[tn] or &ast;[dl] > &ast;[dn].[^19]

A possible acoustic outcome would have been

 3. the mishearing of &ast;[tl] as &ast;[kl] or of &ast;[tn] as &ast;[kn].

Further articulatory outcomes would have been

 4. the denasalisation of &ast;[tn] to &ast;[td] or of &ast;[kn] to &ast;[kd].
 5. reinterpretation of first-syllable shortened Pre-Oceanic [ə] as /o/, anticipating the stressed vowel, giving _&ast;toloŋ_, _&ast;tolom_ etc.

This account explains

i)   why _&ast;-n-_ and _&ast;-d-_ don’t co-occur with _&ast;p-_: there is no _&ast;ponom_ or _&ast;podom_ in [Table 15](#table-15),
     because the difference in point of articulation between _&ast;p_ and _&ast;l_ means that changes
     parallel to (1)-(4) did not occur.
ii)  why there is a gap in 4.3.2.3 where _&ast;dodom_ would occur: &ast;[dd] would result in loss of
     distinctiveness.
iii) why the first vowel of the forms in 4.3.2.3 is _&ast;-o-_, not _&ast;-i-_ (as predicted by PMP _&ast;tilen_).
iv) indirectly why _&ast;toloŋ_, was metathesised as _&ast;toŋol_: metathesis increased distinctiveness by
    separating _&ast;t_ from _&ast;l_.

Just one known Oceanic form reflects the vowels of PMP _&ast;tilen_. The POc status of the reconstruction has a question mark, as it is possible that the Fijian form has arisen by some other route. It is unlikely—but not impossible—that Fijian has preserved a form not found elsewhere in Oceanic. A number of forms reflecting metathesised PWOc _&ast;toŋol_ (p261) also have _-i-_ in their first syllable, but these are presumably local developments.

[PMP &ast;_tilen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-259-POc-tilom-a)


<a id="p-260"></a>

The POc forms _&ast;tolo_(m)/_&ast;tolom-i-_ and _&ast;toloŋ_/_&ast;toloŋ-i-_ with the vowel replacement proposed in (iii) have the scattered reflexes listed below. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2001d) ([2001d](Source#cldf:Lynch2001d)) points out that Proto New Caledonian _&ast;tonom_ may reflect either POc _&ast;tolom_ or POc _&ast;tonom_, as _&ast;-l-_ and _&ast;-n-_ have merged.

[PMP &ast;_tilen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-260-POc-tolom-a)

[PMP &ast;_tilen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-260-POc-tolo-a)

A metathesised form PWOc _&ast;toŋol_/_&ast;toŋol-i-_ is widely reflected in Western Oceanic languages. However, bear in mind that Western Oceanic was a dialect network, and ‘Proto Western Oceanic’ simply refers to the stage when innovations still spread freely across the network. Evidently the metathesised form coexisted with unmetathesised _&ast;toloŋ_ (VI)/_&ast;toloŋ-i-_, as attested by the NNG and PT forms above. Indeed, the Megiar dialect of Takia has _-tuluŋ-i-_, whilst the Karkar Island dialects have _-tiŋal-i_.

A similarly metathesised form occurs in South Efate and South Vanuatu, and coexists with an unmetathesised reflex in Anejom. As metathesised reflexes occur in widely separated Oceanic groups—Western Oceanic and South Vanuatu—one might reconstruct metathesised POc _&ast;toŋol_/_&ast;toŋol-i-_. However, given the absence of reflexes elsewhere in Oceanic, we assume that the metathesised forms in Western Oceanic and South Efate/South Vanuatu reflect separate innovations. The fact that South Efate here groups with South Vanuatu is unsurprising, as South Efate is the closest external relative of the South Vanuatu languages ([Lynch 2000c](Source#cldf:Lynch2000c)).

Forms reflecting the change from POc _&ast;tolom_ to _&ast;tono_(m) occur in two areas: in North New Guinea, where final _&ast;-m_ is lost, and in SE Solomonic, where the contrast between intransitive and transitive forms is retained, final _&ast;-m_ being retained in transitives.

Turning now to cases where initial _&ast;t-_ has been voiced to initial _&ast;d-_, there is again no need to reconstruct these as POc alternants. Forms in _d-_ occur only in NCV languages

[PMP &ast;_tilen_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-263-POc-tolom-a)

Forms reflecting a hypothetical _&ast;donom_ appear in Kilivila and in languages scattered through north and central Vanuatu. We take the Vanuatu forms to reflect nasalisation of the _&ast;-l-_ of PNCV _&ast;dolo_ /_&ast;dolom-i-_ above.

Moving to forms in which POc _&ast;t-_ has been replaced by _&ast;k-_, the Psohoh and NCV terms below almost certainly reflect separate local changes.

A large block of Meso-Melanesian forms appears to reflect a PMM _&ast;konom_, which itself reflects nasalisation of _&ast;-l-_ as _&ast;-n-_ and acoustic reinterpretation of a _&ast;tn-_ cluster as _&ast;kn-_ (i.e. (2), then (3), above), followed by vowel insertion. Under ‘cf. also’ are listed MM terms for ‘neck’ which appear to be derived from reflexes of PMM _&ast;konom_.

<a id="p-264"></a>

Forms reflecting the denasalisation of _&ast;-n-_ in PMM _&ast;konom_ to produce _&ast;kodom_ are also found in Meso-Melanesian languages. The fact that Tolai kodom (below) appears alongside closely related Minigir konomi and Tolai (Nodup dialect) konome indicates that denasalisation is a localised and sporadic phenomenon.

[5-4-3-4-264-mm-tolai-kodom](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-3-4-264-mm-tolai-kodom)

Forms reflecting a hypothetical POc _&ast;sonom_ (see [Table 15](#table-15)) have not been accounted for. The hypothetical form POc _&ast;solom_ is nowhere reflected, implying that _&ast;sonom_ is not a phonologically modified form of POc _&ast;tolom_. We offer three hypotheses as to its origin, none of them fully satisfactory. First, POc _&ast;tilom_ may have given rise to _&ast;silom_ (_&ast;t_ > _s_ is common before _-i-_ in Oceanic languages), followed by replacement of the vowel as suggested in (5) above. Second, it may reflect a blend of _&ast;tolom_ with an ancestor of PNNG _&ast;soŋo_ ‘chew (betel)’, listed below—but this is unlikely, as Bariai reflects POc _&ast;sonom_ and _&ast;soŋo_ separately. Or it may have a separate but unknown extra-Oceanic origin.

There is just one possible reflex of _&ast;sonom_ with denasalisation (i.e. hypothetical _&ast;sodom_), namely Nakanai sogomu ‘swallow’ (_g_ < _&ast;d[r]_), but final _-u_ is unexplained.

The Micronesian set below appears to be formally connected with the sets above, but reflects a hypothetical POc _&ast;(w)o(rR)o/&ast;(w)o(rR)omi_, which is perhaps explained as an unsourced loan.

#### 3.5.1. Biting


POc _&ast;kaRati_ and POc _&ast;kati_, both meaning ‘bite’ possibly share a single source somewhere in their history. Some of the _-r-_less NCV terms, especially from islands towards the south, and all the Fijian and Polynesian terms could be reflexes of either, though the short _-a-_ of the Polynesian reflexes probably reflects _&ast;kati_.

<a id="p-267"></a>

Unambigous reflexes of POc _&ast;koto(p)_ have been found only in NW Solomonic languages and in one NCV language. However, it is possible that POc _&ast;ŋoto_ (VI), _&ast;ŋot-i_ (VT) ‘bite’ reflects a putative PMP †_&ast;[ma]ŋete[b,p]_, a possible intransitive form of the same root (of which no non-Oceanic reflexes are known; cf. [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5). If so, then the intransitivising function of initial _&ast;ŋ-_ had clearly been lost in Proto Oceanic, as a new transitive was formed by adding the POc transitive suffix _&ast;-i_ to the new root.

Although Blust (ACD) finds plentiful non-Oceanic data for the reconstruction of PMP _&ast;gutgut_, the only Oceanic reflexes appear to be in Fijian and Micronesian. Blust’s (1977) canonic derivation of POc verbs from PMP reduplicated monosyllables applies, giving POc _&ast;kukut_ (VI), _&ast;kut-i_ (VT) ‘bite’.

[PMP &ast;_gutgut_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-5-268-POc-kukut-a)

We note the small cognate set below because it again manifests the phonaesthetic pattern mentioned in [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-4).2.

#### 3.5.2. Licking and tasting


POc _&ast;d(r)amʷi(s)_/_&ast;d(r)amʷis-i-_ ‘lick, taste’ is well reflected, but poses some small formal puzzles. First, PMic _&ast;camʷ(a,i)-ti_ ‘lick’ is odd in that _&ast;-t-_ reflects POc _&ast;-t-_ (i.e. hypothetical POc _&ast;d(r)amʷ(a,i)t-i-_) rather than the _&ast;-s-_ reflected elsewhere. Second, the data suggest that both POc _&ast;d(r)amʷis-i-_ and _&ast;d(r)amʷe_ should be reconstructed as transitives corresponding to intransitive _&ast;d(r)amʷi(s)_ ‘lick, taste’. It may well be that the two forms co-existed, perhaps in different dialects.

Third, there is a small cognate set reflecting PNGOc _&ast;d(r)amʷa_/_&ast;d(r)amʷar-i-_ ‘lick’. It is treated as a separate verb rather than being integrated into the first set below, but the two sets cannot be distinguished on the basis of meaning.

Cognates of the next set are evidently derived from POc _&ast;mea_ ‘tongue’ ([§3.4.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-12#cldf:5-4).4), but no reconstruction is proposed as borrowing across the NW/SE Solomonic boundary cannot be ruled out.

<a id="s-3-5-3"></a>

#### 3.5.3. Holding in the mouth


Oceanic languages display a number of apparently almost-but-not-quite-cognate forms with a range of meanings that centre on holding in the mouth. The reconstructable POc forms are

- _&ast;komi_ ‘close the jaws on s.t., hold s.t. in the mouth’ < PMP _&ast;kemi_
- _&ast;ogom_ (VI), _&ast;ogom-i_ (VT) ‘hold in the mouth’ < PMP _&ast;eŋkem_ (see below)
- _&ast;gomu_ ‘keep s.t. in the mouth’
- _&ast;qumu(R)_ ‘suck, hold in mouth’
- _&ast;omu(R)_ ‘roll food around in the mouth’< PMP _&ast;emuR_
- _&ast;mumu(R)_ ‘hold in the mouth and suck’ < PMP _&ast;muRmuR_

Blust’s [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) reveals the reason for this plethora. Proto Malayo-Polynesian also had several such forms, and the analysis in [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Blust1988)) suggests that they each have their origins in two early (or pre-)Austronesian roots, the first two in _&ast;kem_, glossed as ‘enclose, cover, grasp’ and the last three in _&ast;-muR_, glossed as ‘gargle, rinse the mouth’ (ACD). Four of the resulting POc forms share _&ast;-om[-]_, giving rise to possible blending. The third, POc _&ast;gomu_, has no known non- Oceanic cognates, and appears to be an Oceanic blend of _&ast;ogom_ and _&ast;omu(R)_.

A number of reflexes of POc _&ast;komi_ below contain _-u-_ for _-o-_. POc _&ast;komi_ is reconstructed as it is the regular continuation of PMP _&ast;kemi_. Items with _-u-_ reflect a tendency for stressed _&ast;-o-_ to be raised before a sequence of _&ast;-m-_ + high vowel (_&ast;-i_ or _&ast;-u_; cf. POc _&ast;gomu_ below).

[PMP &ast;_kemi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-3-5-270-POc-komi-a)


<a id="p-271"></a>

Blust (ACD) also lists PMP _&ast;qeŋkem_ ‘enclose; hold in the mouth’ as a possible ancestor of the forms below, but the absence of a _&ast;q-_ reflex from the SE Solomonic forms points to PMP _&ast;eŋgem_, or, considering the root _&ast;kem_, PMP _&ast;eŋkem_.

### 3.6. Actions performed with the lips


The terms in this section denote sucking noises, and it appears that in Proto Oceanic, as in some modern Oceanic languages, two such noises were recognised. The first was a smacking of the lips to express a refusal or dissatisfaction, denoted by POc _&ast;misi(k)_. The second, a kissing noise used to call a dog or pig, or sometimes to attract someone’s attention, was the meaning of POc _&ast;[u]jumu_/_&ast;[u]jum-i-_.

<a id="s-3-6-1"></a>

#### 3.6.1. The sucking noise signal


POc _&ast;misi(k)_ is accompanied below by two formally similar reconstructions, _&ast;musi_ and _&ast;mʷiti_, also meaning ‘suck’ or ‘make a sucking noise’. It is tempting to combine _&ast;musi_ with _&ast;misi(k)_, reconstructing a hypothetical POc _&ast;mʷisi_. The reason for not doing so is that POc _&ast;misi(k)_ has widespread reflexes associated with expressing refusal or dissatisfaction, whereas this element of meaning is missing from reflexes of _&ast;musi_ and _&ast;mʷiti_.[^28] Reflexes of _&ast;musi_ and _&ast;mʷiti_ have similar meanings, but their forms do not allow one to unite them in a single set.

The obstacle to reconstructing a term for ‘belch’ is almost certainly paucity of data.

#### 3.7.3. Farting


There are a number of terms for ‘fart, break wind’. The most widespread is POc _&ast;bʷisi_, which seems from some of its glosses to have originally had the sense ‘spurt, splash’. This was perhaps a euphemism which almost replaced the inherited term, POc _&ast;(q)utut_ ‘fart’, for which there is just one known reflex. Other terms are also likely to have arisen via euphemism.

In [§3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8#cldf:5-4), terms for the substances emitted by the body are reconstructed. In this section we reconstruct the verbs associated with the emission or elimination of these substances. However, there is no one-to-one correspondence between substance terms and verbs (and this is probably so across languages generally). POc speakers used the same terms, or terms derived from the same roots, for ‘saliva/spittle’ and ‘spit’ ([§4.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-3#cldf:5-4)), for ‘perspiration’ and ‘perspire’ ([§4.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-6#cldf:5-4)), ‘urine’ and ‘urinate’ ([§4.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-7#cldf:5-4)) and in one of two instances for ‘faeces’ ([§3.8.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-6#cldf:5-4)) and ‘defecate’ ([§4.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-8#cldf:5-4)). For ‘blood’ there was perhaps no associated verb ‘bleed’. For ‘earwax’ there is no corresponding verb. For ‘tears’ ([§3.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-1#cldf:5-4)) the associated verb is ‘weep’ ([§4.7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-7-3#cldf:5-4)), but the latter has a wider range of meanings than ‘tears’ and there was in any case apparently no single-word term for tears. Oddly, the term for ‘snot, nasal mucus’ ([§3.8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-3#cldf:5-4)) is the root of a verb meaning ‘grunt, growl, snore’ ([§3.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-7#cldf:5-4)).


<a id="p-279"></a>

Some verbs associated with the emission of substances from the body are handled in other sections. Vomiting ([§4.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-4#cldf:5-4)) is placed under events involving the digestive system, and weeping ([§4.7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-7-3#cldf:5-4)) under physical responses to emotion or pain.

Bodily function verbs like ‘sneeze’, ‘yawn’, ‘urinate’ and ‘die’ are intransitive in their simple form. However, a typical POc verb will also have derived transitive forms carrying additional information. With verbs of secretion and excretion the transitive form in _&ast;-i_ took a location as its object (‘he urinated on the __ground__’), and the transitive form in _&ast;-akin[i]_ marked the product as the object ([Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):197–199).[^31]


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Bleeding


No POc verb meaning ‘bleed’ can be reconstructed with certainty. POc _&ast;ma-draRa(q)_ (cf POc _&ast;draRa(q)_ ‘blood’, [§3.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-3-3#cldf:5-4)) almost certainly meant ‘bloody’ (_&ast;ma-_ formed property expressions; [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).4), but it is unclear whether it also had the dynamic verbal sense ‘bleed’, or whether the etymon first acquired this sense in PSOc.

[PMP &ast;_ma-daRaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-1-279-POc-madraraq-a)

A number of Oceanic languages use a phrase meaning ‘blood flows’, and it is likely that such a phrase was also used in POc.

<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Menstruating


No reconstructions have been made. Many dictionary terms are euphemisms as in Molima _tabu-tabu_, Niue _gagao fifine_ ‘woman’s illness’, Tongan _fakakelekele_ ‘make unclean’, ’Are’are _ʔoni i sihani_ ‘stay outside (the village)’. Marshallese uses a term _betektek_, an irregular derivation from POc _&ast;taqe_ ‘excrement’. Various terms collected, including Tolo _reivula_ (_vula_ ‘moon’) and Owa _fagaifa_ ‘moon, month, woman’s period’ reflect an association with the moon.


<a id="p-280"></a>


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Spitting and spittle


Apart from compounds meaning ‘water of mouth’, i.e. saliva’ ([§3.8.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-4#cldf:5-4)), POc terms for ‘to spit’ and ‘spittle, saliva’ are remarkably recalcitrant when it comes to formal reconstruction, as two families of reconstructions are found, each containing several sets of related forms. For convenience we refer to them as (1) the _&ast;isu_ and (2) the _&ast;supa_ families. Each set within each family yields a distinct reconstruction attributable to POc or PWOc, a situation which does not allow reconstruction of a single form at the POc interstage.

The _&ast;isu_ family includes POc _&ast;kanisu_, PWOc _&ast;kamisu_, POc _&ast;ŋisu_ and POc _&ast;k(i,u)su_. Even these forms are questionable, as daughter languages also reflect the final _-isu_ as _-usu_ or _-usi_.[^32] This alternation appears to go back to PEMP, as Serui-Laut _kunui_ reflects _&ast;kanusi_ whilst Wandamen _kanisu_ reflects _&ast;kanisu_ ([Blust 1978a](Source#cldf:Blust1978a):213). A further complication is that Blust reconstructs both the PEMP and POc forms with _&ast;q-_, but the two EMP forms and Ubir, Motu and Fijian all reflect _&ast;k-_, as reconstructed here. Polynesian languages reflect an irregular PPn _&ast;q-_.

[PEMP &ast;_kanisu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-280-POc-kanisu-a)


<a id="p-281"></a>

At first sight the forms below look like reflexes of _&ast;kanisu_ in which _&ast;-n-_ has been replaced by _-m-_. However, there is nothing to cause this replacement, and the geographic distribution of the reflexes points to a separate earlier form with _-m-_.[^33] SE Solomonic forms and Dorig lack _&ast;ka-_.

[POc &ast;_kamisu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-281-POc-kamisu-a)

POc _&ast;ŋusu_/_&ast;ŋisu_ are reconstructed separately from the forms above, as its reflexes can only be derived from _&ast;kanisu_ or _&ast;kanusu_ by positing independent idiosyncratic innovations in NNG and SES languages.

[POc &ast;_ŋisu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-281-POc-isu-a)

POc _&ast;kisu_ or _&ast;kusu_ is reconstructed below because it perhaps provides the key to understanding this family of reconstructions.


<a id="p-282"></a>

[POc &ast;_kisu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-282-POc-kisu-a)

Alternating POc reconstructions sometimes reflect alternations in PMP verbal morphology ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4)), and this appears to be the most complex case we have encountered. POc _&ast;kisu_/_&ast;kusu_ evidently reflects a PMP verb, for which, however, no non-Oceanic evidence is known. POc _&ast;ŋisu_/_&ast;ŋusu_ reflects the intransitive (actor voice) form of the verb, formed by replacing the initial _&ast;k-_ of the root with the homorganic nasal _&ast;ŋ-_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).6). PWOc _&ast;kamisu_/_&ast;kimusu_ appears to reflect an alternative form of the intransitive, formed by infixing _⟨um⟩_ after the initial consonant of the root, giving expected POc †_&ast;k⟨um⟩isu_ or †_&ast;k⟨um⟩usu_. Finally, the set _&ast;kanisu_/_&ast;kanusu_/_&ast;kanusi_/_&ast;kinusu_ appears to reflect a nominalisation formed by infixing _⟨in⟩_ after the initial consonant of the root, giving expected POc †_&ast;k⟨in⟩isu_ or †_&ast;k⟨in⟩usu_, the latter reflected in Tabar _kinocu_. The _&ast;-a-_ vowel in POc _&ast;kanisu_/_&ast;kanusu_/_&ast;kanusi_ and PWOc _&ast;kamisu_ is taken to reflect epenthesis, as the infixes were almost certainly not stressed in POc, giving forms like _&ast;[k(ə)nisu]_ and _&ast;[k(ə)misu]_ (cf. Kokota and Maringe _kmisu_).

The second family of forms includes POc _&ast;supa_ and _&ast;ka-supa_, where _&ast;ka-_ appears to reflect the PMP formative _&ast;ka-_ found in stative intransitive verbs ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).4). However, this is uncertain, as _&ast;ka-supa_ is not stative in meaning. The Nakanai, Boumaa Fijian and Micronesian reflexes of _&ast;ka-supa_ point to a transitive with an unexplained root-final _&ast;-t_.[^34] Here again there are variant forms, but we have no explanation for these: the forms listed below _&ast;ka-supa[t-i]_ under ‘cf. also’ reflect a replacement of _&ast;-s-_ by _&ast;-n-_ (Roinji), by _&ast;-t-_ (Nakanai) or _&ast;-(r,R)-_ (Bulu, Bola, Misima).

[POc &ast;_ka-supa&#91;t-i&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-283-POc-kasupati-a)

Finally, Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;qizuR_,[^36] with just two known Oceanic reflexes:


<a id="p-284"></a>

[PMP &ast;_qizuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-3-284-POc-qijur-a)

One further term _&ast;puRuk_ ‘spray water from the mouth; spray a mixture of saliva and masticated medicinal herbs on an ailing body part in curing’ is included with supporting evidence in [§5.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4-2#cldf:5-4).1.


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Vomiting


Two POc terms have been reconstructed, _&ast;[mu]mutaq_ and _&ast;luaq_. A number of languages (Lou, Gela, Longgu, To’aba’ita, Kwaio) have reflexes in both sets. Their glosses suggest that _&ast;[mu]mutaq_ simply meant ‘vomit’, whereas _&ast;luaq_ denoted forceful ejection of a substance from the body, as discussed below.

POc _&ast;mutaq_ reflects PMP _&ast;um-utaq_, i.e. the root preceded by the intransitive actor voice affix ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5).

[PAn &ast;_utaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-4-284-POc-mumutaq-a)


<a id="p-285"></a>

The Lou, Mangap, Gela, Kwaio and Samoan terms suggest that POc _&ast;luaq_ may have implied a more forceful action of vomiting or spitting, perhaps also including the ejaculation of seminal fluid as in To’aba’ita and Rennellese. As with the verbs of secretion and excretion discussed in [§4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:5-4), the transitive form in _&ast;-i_ took a location as its object (_&ast;luaq-i_ ‘vomit on’), and the transitive form in _&ast;-akin[i]_ marked the product as the object (_&ast;luaq-akin[i]_ (VT) ‘vomit s.t. up’).

<a id="p-286"></a>


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Ejaculation of seminal fluid


No separate term for ejaculation of seminal fluid can be reconstructable, but it seems possible that this was one of the senses of POc &ast;luaq above ([§4.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4-4#cldf:5-4)), as this is one of the meanings of the To’aba’ita and Rennellese reflexes of the latter.


<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Sweating, perspiring and perspiration


POc _&ast;maqono_ ‘sweat’ appears from its form (_&ast;ma-_ + disyllabic root) to have originally been a verb, but a number of its reflexes, often reduplicated, are now nouns. The absence or presence of final _&ast;-ta_, reflected in ’Are’are and Maewo, is unexplained.

No extra-Polynesian cognates of PPn _&ast;ka-kawa_ have been found.

<a id="s-4-7"></a>

### 4.7. Urinating and urine


PMP _&ast;miqmiq_ ‘urinate, urine’ seems to have had two POc reflexes, (i) the expected form _&ast;mimiq_ and (ii) a form _&ast;mimi(s)_ in which _&ast;-q_ was replaced by _&ast;-s_. The final _&ast;-s_ surfaces only in the transitive form _&ast;mimis-i-_ ‘urinate on’, and it is of course possible that some of the reflexes assigned to _&ast;mimi(s)_ below in which no final consonant is retained should be assigned to _&ast;mimiq_ and vice versa.

Assignments of forms in which no final consonant is retained are made on the basis of the geographic distribution of reflexes of the two forms. Forms that reflect _&ast;-q_ are located in NNG and PT languages, in the northernmost subgroup of Meso-Melanesian, namely Tungag-Nalik of northern New Ireland, and in scattered NCV languages of Malakula. Forms that reflect _&ast;-s_ are found in Nakanai (MM, Willaumez), in several SE Solomonic languages, in a number of NCV languages from Ambae and Malakula, and in Bauan and Wayan Fijian. Admiralties forms have all lost the final consonant, but are assigned to _&ast;mimiq_ on the assumption that Proto Admiralty separated early from the rest of Oceanic and is more likely to have preserved the conservative form _&ast;mimiq_. All other forms that have lost the final consonant occur in the region of _&ast;mimis-i-_ forms and are assumed to reflect _&ast;mimi(s)_.

But there are complications. Several languages assumed to reflect _&ast;mimiq_ actually reflect a variant _&ast;memeq_. They are Mussau, Mumeng, Kapin, Lala and Bali—well scattered. A number of South New Ireland languages and Proto NW Solomonic, assumed to reflect _&ast;mimi(s)_, usually retain POc final consonants, but the relevant reflexes below all have the form _mimi_, suggesting that the final consonant was irregularly lost in these languages. And finally a number of North/Central Vanuatu and New Caledonian languages reflect PSOc _&ast;meRe-_ ‘urine’, _&ast;[me]meRe_ ‘urinate’, _meRes-i-_ ‘urinate on’.[^37] This seems to be a variant of POc _&ast;mimi(s)_ ‘urinate’, _&ast;mimis-i-_ ‘urinate on s.t.’ which replaces the root _&ast;mimis_ with the root _&ast;meRes_.[^38]


<a id="p-288"></a>

It is difficult to offer an explanation of this variation, other than to suggest that euphemism may have led to wordplay. But this does not account for the fact that almost all the forms mentioned above occur in NCV languages, and that closely related languages have in some cases inherited different forms.

[PSOc &ast;_meRe-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-7-290-PSOc-mere-a)

The set of forms below has no known cognates outside New Guinea Oceanic (NNG, PT) and raises several puzzles. If the PNGOc etymon was a trisyllable with final -CV, then its reduction to a disyllable in Wab, Bing and Numbami is puzzling. It would be explained if Sio busali were originally a transitive verb reflecting suffix _&ast;-i_ ‘urinate on’. The PNGOc intransitive root ‘urinate’ would then have been _&ast;bʷaju(r,R)_,[^40] the transitive _&ast;bʷaju(r,R)-i_, but the PT forms in final _-u_ do not support this reconstruction, as the default vowel added after an inherited final consonant in Suauic languages (i.e. Tubetube and Suau) is _-i_, not the attested _-u_. Furthermore, the sets of forms listed under ‘cf. also’ appear to reflect PPT _&ast;bʷasoso_ and PPT _&ast;bʷasi_ and their relationship to the reconstructed form is not understood.

<a id="p-291"></a>


<a id="s-4-8"></a>

### 4.8. Defecating


Like POc _&ast;mimiq_, reflexes of POc _&ast;pekas_ are generally intransitive, but can be transitivised when additional information is included (_&ast;pekas-i_ ‘defecate on s.t.’, _&ast;pekas-aki[ni]_ ‘defecate s.t.’). POc _&ast;taqe_ was primarily a noun, ‘faeces’, but is reflected as a verb in some languages (see [§3.8.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-6#cldf:5-4)).

When more than one term is reconstructable, one may be used as a polite term. e.g. in Tikopia _tiko_ is the regular word, while _peka_ is used in the presence of kin with whom constraint of relationship is observed.

[POc &ast;_pekas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-4-8-291-POc-pekas-a)


<a id="p-292"></a>

A number of languages use reflexes of POc _&ast;tape_ ‘to flow’ ([vol.2:93](ContributionTable?anchor=p-93#cldf:2-4)), commonly referring to the flow of blood or other liquids, but sometimes referring to excretory functions (Gela _tave toba_ ‘diarrhoea’, Mota _tatave_ ‘to excrete’).


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Respiration and events involving the respiratory organs



<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Breathing


POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ ‘breathe’ is among a small group of experiential POc verbs beginning with the prefix _&ast;ma-_ where the intransitive subject is a human experiencer ([Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):276; [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).4). Other _&ast;ma-_ initial verbs discussed here include POc _&ast;[ma]soru_ ‘hiccup’, POc _&ast;mawap_ ‘yawn’, and _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ ‘sleep, to be asleep’.


<a id="p-293"></a>

There is a great deal of variation in the English glosses of reflexes, but much of it falls into place when it is recognised that the inherited core meaning of POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ was something like ‘living essence, soul’ of a human being, which included breathing and the beating heart as the physical manifestation of life. ‘Rest’ follows from this: cf. English ‘take a breather’.

Occasional reflexes of POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_ include reference to the fontanelle. This is a visible pulse in a young baby, reflecting the fact that the baby is alive.

Proto Polynesian has two reflexes of POc _&ast;[ma]ñawa_, namely PPn _&ast;mānawa_ ‘breathe; breath’ and PPn _&ast;manawa_ ‘belly’. In consequence it is tempting to reconstruct a pair of POc (near-)homophones, but this would probably be a mistake, as the contrast between short and long vowels is a Central Pacific (Fijian and Polynesian) phenomenon. PPn _&ast;mā-_ marked an undergoer-subject intransitive verb, and _&ast;mānawa_ was a verb meaning ‘breathe’. The nominal ‘breath’ gloss represents a derivation. PPn _&ast;manawa_ on the other hand was a noun, ‘belly’.

The two Polynesian sets are kept separate below, even though the reflexes of the two forms are identical in several (especially Eastern Polynesian) languages where the long/short vowel distinction has been lost in this pair of etyma.

The terms below include three cognate forms from north New Ireland languages and possible cognates from the Guadalcanal-Gelic cluster of the Southeast Solomons which differ only in lacking the initial consonant. The forms with m- apparently reflect an actor voice form ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5).

### 5.2. Gasping and panting


There are no well populated cognate sets for ‘gasp’ or ‘pant’, but there are enough data to allow two reconstructions. Only the first, POc _&ast;oŋap_ ‘pant, be out of breath’, has known non-Oceanic cognates, and only its Gela reflex is problem-free. Other reflexes display the irregularities indicated in parentheses, and the first three lack a reflex of initial POc _&ast;o-_.

[PMP &ast;_eŋap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-5-2-295-POc-oap-a)


<a id="p-296"></a>

The other reconstruction is POc _&ast;ŋaRa_, which, despite various meaning extensions in its reflexes, appears to have meant ‘be breathless, pant’ and to have included asthmatic panting.

### 5.3. Snoring


Probably POc _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘grunt, growl, snore’ reflects the same root as _&ast;ŋorok_ ‘snot’ ([§3.8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-3#cldf:5-4)). A reduplicated form _&ast;ŋoro-ŋorok_ means ‘channel above upper lip’ ([§3.4.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-12#cldf:5-4)).

### 5.4. Blowing air from the mouth


Several POc verbs of blowing are reconstructable, but most of these refer to the blowing of the wind, and are presented in [vol.2:125](ContributionTable?anchor=p-125#cldf:2-5)–127. The only POc verbs which we can say with some confidence denoted a person blowing air from the mouth are the pair _&ast;ipu_ and _&ast;upi_, which probably have a common origin in PMP _&ast;ibut_ ‘breeze, draught of wind’. We can be reasonably confident about their meaning because their reflexes are used of playing traditional flutes and by extension for the flutes themselves ([vol.1:107](ContributionTable?anchor=p-107#cldf:1-4)–108).

### 5.5. Gaping


Three reconstructions with the same root, POc _&ast;(q)aŋap_, denote the notion of gaping or having one’s mouth wide open. In the first set below the root occurs by itself. The other two reflect the affixes _&ast;⟨um⟩_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5) and _&ast;paN-_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).6), both forming dynamic intransitive verbs.

### 5.6. Yawning


A single cognate set embraces all of Oceanic and indeed all the Austronesian family. Blust (ACD) writes:

> Irregular reflexes of PAn _&ast;Suab_ are quite common, particularly in the Oceanic languages. The cognation of such Oceanic forms as Seimat maw (where only -/w/ remains from the original stem) with Western Malayo-Polynesian forms such as Kelabit _uab_ is clear from the fairly abundant intermediate forms that reflect PAn _&ast;ma-Suab_ ( > _ma-huab_ > _ma-uab_ > _mawab_).

> A perfect parallel is seen in PAn _&ast;ma-Seyaq_, POc _&ast;mayaq_ ‘shy, ashamed’. In both cases the boundary between the stative prefix _&ast;ma-_ and the stem has been lost in all CEMP witnesses. The only non-CEMP language in which a similar loss of morpheme boundary has taken place is Chamorro (with _magap_, for expected _&ast;&ast;magwap_ ‘yawn’). Following the reanalysis of _&ast;ma-uab_ as _&ast;mawab_ a number of CEMP languages have either introduced a new stative marker, or have reduplicated the first syllable of the new stem. It remains unclear how many of these added syllables (if any) are the result of convergent developments (ACD).

Reduplicated forms of the kind Blust refers to are shown separately below the main cognate set.

### 5.7. Coughing


It is difficult to detect any difference in meaning between POc _&ast;koso_, POc _&ast;pukuR_/PROc _&ast;puRuk_ and PWOc _&ast;kuk(a,u)_. Rather, POc _&ast;pukuR_ appears to be synonymous with _&ast;koso_ and to have won out in the Bel group (part of North New Guinea) and in much of SE Solomonic. POc &ast;kuk(a,u) is intriguing: few reflexes are found, but their distribution indicates a POc origin.

### 5.8. Sniffing and blowing one’s nose


Two terms are reconstructed, POc _&ast;s(i,u)r(i,u)(t)_ ‘sniff, blow nose’ and POc _&ast;paŋus_, _&ast;paŋus-i-_ ‘blow one’s nose’. The latter almost certainly bears a historical relationship to PAn _&ast;Siŋus_/PMP _&ast;hiŋus_ ‘sniff, sniffle (as with a runny nose)’ (ACD) and to the terms for ‘snot’ listed at the end of [§3.8.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8-3#cldf:5-4), but it is not clear what the (morphological) relationship is.

### 5.9. Sneezing


Forms for ‘sneeze’ can be divided into two main groups:

- a western group embracing the Admiralties, Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic, reflecting
  putative onomatopoeic POc forms such as ?_&ast;(k)asipeŋ_, POc ?_&ast;(k)asiŋe(k)_ or ?_&ast;(k)asio_;
- an eastern group embracing Vanuatu and Micronesia, reflecting PROc _&ast;mʷat(i,u)a_
  ‘sneeze’.

In addition there are numerous cognate sets too local in extent to be included here.

The reconstructions associated with the western group are prefixed by a question mark because (i) the data support several formally similar but distinct reconstructions; and (ii) the data contain a good many irregularities (shown in parentheses below) in relation to normal sound correspondences. Both phenomena suggest that onomatopoeia (sound symbolism) has been at work, sometimes resisting the effects of regular sound change, sometimes making otherwise arbitrary changes in forms. For example, the MM reflexes below of POc ?_&ast;(k)asipeŋ_ point to _&ast;(k)atipeŋ_, i.e. _&ast;-s-_ was at some point replaced by _&ast;-t-_. The Gela, Lengo and Longgu reflexes below reflect unpredicted loss of _&ast;(k)a-_ and Gela and Lengo reflect apparent resistance to the sound change that lenited _&ast;-s-_ to _-h-_ or _-ð-_. In each case the innovation (or lack of one) is restricted to a small area.

[POc &ast;_(k)asipeŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-5-9-305-POc-kasipe-a)

If the Mussau and Titan forms below are indeed cognate with the NNG forms (the correspondences are regular), then POc ?_&ast;(k)asiŋe(k)_ can be tentatively reconstructed. All the NNG forms reflect _-s-_, the fortis reflex of POc _&ast;-s-_, where a lenis reflex (in languages from Lukep to Ham either _-y-_ or -∅-) is expected. This seems to be an instance of resistance to sound change for the sake of onomatopoeia.


<a id="p-306"></a>

[POc &ast;_(k)asiŋe(k)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-5-9-306-POc-kasiek-a)

What kind of historical relationship exists between POc ?_&ast;(k)asio_ below and POc ?_&ast;(k)asipeŋ_ and POc ?_&ast;(k)asiŋe(k)_ above is a matter for speculation. POc ?_&ast;(k)asio_ is self-evidently onomatopoeic. Again _-s-_, the fortis reflex of POc _&ast;-s-_, is found where a lenis reflex is expected. Precisely because of its sound symbolism, it is uncertain whether the form existed in POc.

[POc &ast;_(k)asio_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-5-9-306-POc-kasio-a)


<a id="p-307"></a>

The set below is also onomatopoeic, and it is open to debate whether the Meso-Melanesian and Polynesian forms reflect a single POc form or are the result of parallel independent innovations. The Nakanai forms are added because they illustrate effects of onomatopoeia. Superficially they appear to belong to this set, but Nakanai _-h-_ reflects POc _&ast;-q-_, found in none of the forms reconstructed above. Whatever their origins, the Nakanai forms must have acquired _-h-_ through sound symbolism, not by cognacy with forms in any of the western sets presented here.

[POc &ast;_tise_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-5-9-307-POc-tise-a)

The eastern group of ‘sneeze’ forms, reflecting PROc _&ast;mʷat(i,u)a_ ‘sneeze’, is perhaps historically related to an onomatopoeic form like those above via an earlier _&ast;mu-atia_, where _&ast;mu-_ reflects the PMP actor-voice (intransitive) affix _&ast;⟨um⟩_/_&ast;(u)m-_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5).

## 6. Sleeping and waking



<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Sleeping


One POc term for sleeping is reconstructed, _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ ‘sleep, be asleep’, alongside two PWOc terms, _&ast;[ma]puta_ ‘sleep’ and PWOc _&ast;mataip_ ‘be fast asleep’. PEOc _&ast;mo(q)e_ ‘be fast asleep’and PCP &ast;moze ‘sleep’ are also discussed below.

POc _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ (VI) ‘sleep, to be asleep’ contains the _&ast;ma-_ stative prefix that indicates that the subject is a human experiencer ([Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):276). Only Bali and Blablanga (MM) reflect the root _&ast;tuduR_ alone, whilst Bola, Nakanai and Meramera (all Willaumez languages) add mata ‘eye’ to the root to form ‘sleepy’ ([§4.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-2#cldf:5-4).1).

No reflexes of POc _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ are found in New Guinea Oceanic (NNG, PT) languages. In these it is fairly consistently replaced by reflexes of _&ast;qenop_ ‘lie’ ([§6.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2-3#cldf:5-4)), its meaning extended to include both ‘lie’ and ‘sleep. The converse meaning extension whereby a reflex of _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ comes also to mean ‘lie’ is much rarer but is reflected in three New Ireland languages below: Lavongai, Tigak and Tabar.

[PAn &ast;_tuduR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-1-308-POc-maturur-a)


<a id="p-309"></a>

[PWOc &ast;_mataip_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-1-309-PWOc-mataip-a)

How PWOc _&ast;[ma]puta_ differed in meaning from POc _&ast;[ma]turu(R)_ is not clear. Curiously, the seemingly cognate PPn verb &ast;ma-futa meant ‘start up, arise, awake from sleep’. Whether the apparent cognacy is real—with an odd reversal of meaning—or simply a chance resemblance remains unclear.

[PWOc &ast;_&#91;ma&#93;puta_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-1-309-PWOc-maputa-a)

The two reconstructions below, PEOc _&ast;mo(q)e_ ‘be fast asleep’ and PCP _&ast;moze_ ‘sleep’, are similar in form, but cannot be united. If the reflexes of PEOc _&ast;mo(q)e_ are cognate with those of PCP _&ast;moze_, then the former have undergone unexpected loss of PEOc _&ast;-s-_.

<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Being tired


A number of languages distinguish between ‘sleepy’ (‘eye tired’) and ‘weary’ or ‘exhausted’ (‘body tired’) through the use of body-part metaphors.

<a id="s-6-2-1"></a>

#### 6.2.1. Being sleepy


In widely distributed Oceanic languages the idiomatic way of saying ‘I am sleepy’ is a phrase meaning ‘my eyes are sleeping’. In the examples below, the reflex of POc _&ast;mata-_ ‘eye’ is shown with a following hyphen because it takes a possessor suffix (reflecting _&ast;-gu_ ‘my’, _&ast;-mu_ ‘your.S’, _&ast;-ña_ ‘her/his’ etc). The verb in each case is glossed ‘sleep’.

[5-4-6-2-310-nng-mangap-matapot](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-310-nng-mangap-matapot)


<a id="p-311"></a>

In a number of languages the phrasal expression has evolved into a compound.

[5-4-6-2-311-pt-misima-matakenukenu](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-311-pt-misima-matakenukenu)

In yet other languages a different verb is used with ‘eye’, either in a phrase or a compound. The meaning of that verb follows these examples.

[5-4-6-2-311-pt-tawala-matapota](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-311-pt-tawala-matapota)

And in other languages the meaning of the verb is not given independently in the dictionary. In some languages it is glossed ‘sleepy’, suggesting that an earlier independent meaning may have been lost.

[5-4-6-2-311-adm-drehet-mataimili](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-311-adm-drehet-mataimili)

A number of languages use a phrase meaning ‘wants to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’. Arosi has a desiderative prefix gasi that can be used before any verb, hence gasi mauru ‘sleepy’ [want sleep]. Some Central Pacific languages do the same thing with a reflex of the desiderative particle _&ast;via_ ([§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:5-4)) and a term for ‘sleep’ (cf. ‘wants to eat’ for ‘hungry’ and ‘wants to drink’ for ‘thirsty’; §[§4.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-3#cldf:5-4).1–2).

#### 6.2.2. Being weary, exhausted


Oceanic languages commonly have different terms to express different kinds of bodily tiredness, e.g. ‘weak’, ‘fatigued’, ‘exhausted’. The Tolai and Bugotu dictionaries, for instance, each list five terms with general meaning ‘tired, weary’. Body part metaphors also make fine distinctions in meaning, e.g.

[5-4-6-2-312-nng-yabem-lipopo](cf.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-312-nng-yabem-lipopo)

POc, PCP and PPn terms are reconstructed.

POc _&ast;malu[malumu]_ ‘weak, tired’ is a partial reduplication of POc _&ast;[ma]lumu_ ‘soft, gentle, easy’ ([vol.2:215](ContributionTable?anchor=p-215#cldf:2-7)). The Polynesian reflexes show irregular loss of _&ast;-m-_.

[POc &ast;_malu&#91;-malumu&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-312-POc-malumalumu-a)

PCP _&ast;wai-wai_ ‘weak, tired’ is apparently a reduplicated reflex of POc _&ast;waiR_ ‘river, fresh water, stream’ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).4). The gloss of Wayan wai-ðala ‘be weak (of kava etc), diluted, melt, dissolve’ points to the connection between water and weakness.

[PCP &ast;_wai-wai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-2-312-PCP-waiwai-a)

PPn _&ast;fītaqa_ ‘be tired, fatigued’ evidently reflects POc &ast;pita ‘heavy, difficult’, reconstructed below, with the addition of an apparent suffix _&ast;-qa_ (which may reflect the POc adjectivaliser _&ast;-ka_; [Ross 2000](Source#cldf:Ross2000)).

### 6.3. Dreaming


The two POc forms _&ast;nipi_ and _&ast;mipi_, both ‘dream’, reflect fossilised combinations of a reflex of the PMP root _&ast;hipi_ ‘dream’ and the PMP voice affixes _&ast;⟨in⟩_ and _&ast;⟨um⟩_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5). The fact that both forms are reflected, interspersed with one another across a substantial part of Oceania, indicates that the two forms co-existed in POc.

[PMP &ast;_h-in-ipi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-3-313-POc-nipi-a)

[POc &ast;_(b,bʷ)o(l,R)e_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-3-314-POc-bbolre-a)

The next reconstruction is an apparent homonym of POc _&ast;tadra(q)_ ‘look, look up’ ([§8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:5-4)).

### 6.4. Waking up and opening the eyes


The POc transitive verb _&ast;paŋun_ ‘wake (s.o.) up’ is of PAn antiquity and has reflexes throughout Oceanic.

[PAn &ast;_baŋuL_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-4-315-POc-paun-a)


<a id="p-316"></a>

A Proto Central Pacific intransitive verb, _&ast;qadra_ ‘awaken, be awake’, is reconstructable, but no POc intransitive verb with this sense has been identified. The reason seems to be that an expression meaning ‘open the eyes’ is used in many languages for ‘wake up’.

[PCP &ast;_qadra_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-4-316-PCP-qadra-a)

If Lau ada ‘open the eyes, use the eyes’ belonged to this set, _&ast;(q)adra_ could be reconstructed to PEOc. However, the regular Lau reflex of _&ast;(q)adra_ would be _sada_ with prothetic _s-_ following loss of _&ast;q-_, and Lau _ada_ appears instead to be a regular reflex of POc _&ast;tadraq_ ‘look up, see’ ([§8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:5-4))).

Polynesian languages use reflexes of POc _&ast;Ropok_ ‘fly’ ([§6.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-2#cldf:5-4).1; [vol.4:281](ContributionTable?anchor=p-281#cldf:4-6)) to describe the event that occurs when one is suddenly surprised or woken.

[POc &ast;_Ropok_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-6-4-316-POc-ropok-a)

### 6.5. Blinking and closing the eyes


This section is concerned with the momentary action of closing and then opening the eye(s) as in winking or blinking, rather than the initial stage of going to sleep. There is a PMP etymon _&ast;kimet_, whose Oceanic reflexes are evidently restricted to Central Pacific languages.

[PCEMP &ast;_malip_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-7-1-318-POc-malip-a)

PEOc _&ast;mana_ below is evidently not a reflex of POc _&ast;malip_.

<a id="p-319"></a>


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. Grinning


Grinning is closely associated in Oceanic languages with baring the teeth, and in a number of languages the term for ‘tooth’ is derived from the term for ‘grin’. POc _&ast;sisi_, _&ast;ŋiŋi_ and _&ast;ŋisi_ each have a PMP antecedent. The history of POc _&ast;[ŋi]ŋisa_ is discussed below.

Oceanic languages often appear to lack a dedicated verb for smiling. Instead, verbs for ‘laugh’ or ‘grin’ are sometimes additionally glossed ‘smile’.

[PMP &ast;_ziziq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-7-2-319-POc-sisi-a)

Blust (ACD) reconstructs both PWMP _&ast;ŋiŋi_ ‘grin, show the teeth’ and PMP _&ast;ŋisi_ ‘grin, show the teeth’. PMP _&ast;ŋiŋi_ and _&ast;ŋisi_ are evidently the antecedents of POc _&ast;ŋiŋi_ and _&ast;ŋisi_ below. The data also require the reconstruction of POc _&ast;[ŋi]ŋisa_. Any attempt to combine any two of the three sets fails, as we are compelled to posit irregular developments, and the existence of non- Oceanic cognates of both POc _&ast;ŋiŋi_ and POc _&ast;ŋisi_ confirms that both should be reconstructed. The presence of three formally similar POc terms with the same meaning may appear suspect, but the evidence requires their reconstruction, even though their reflexes have perhaps been conflated in some languages. Some reflexes could be attributed to more than one set, and we have made attributions as best we can on the basis of phonology and glosses.

The meaning ‘tooth’ could also be attributed to each of these reconstructions, but as there were other POc terms for teeth ([§3.4.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-12#cldf:5-4).5) that do not include the sense ‘bare the teeth’, ‘tooth’ may be a secondary meaning that has arisen independently in various daughter-languages.

### 7.3. Weeping and crying


Two sets of POc terms are reconstructed for ‘cry, weep’:

- _&ast;taŋis_ (VI) ‘cry, lament etc.’, _&ast;tanis-i-_ (VT) ‘to cry for (s.t.’), _&ast;tanis-aki[ni]-_ ‘cry because of s.t.’
- _&ast;ŋara(s)_ (VI) ‘cry’, (VT) _&ast;ŋaras-i-_ ‘cry for (s.t.)’


<a id="p-321"></a>

POc _&ast;taŋis_ appears to have been the default term. The glosses of both cognate sets suggest that their primary meaning had to do with the sound of crying rather than the shedding of tears, and the glosses of reflexes of POc _&ast;ŋara(s)_ suggest that it denoted weeping accompanied by very loud crying.

### 7.4. Grunting and moaning


Verbs of grunting, groaning, moaning and the like appear often to be local onomatopoeic innovations, so that cognate sets barely exist and, even where we find putative cognates, there is a possibility of independent parallel innovation. It is possible that some members of the set below do not reflect POc _&ast;[ŋuk]ŋuk_ ‘grunt, moan’ but are independent coinages.

### 7.5. Goosebumps


No POc reconstruction has been made, but a number of terms for goosebumps have been collected which identify it with thorns or prickles of plants, barbs of sago leaf or spikes of spiny fish. The Wayan Fijian and Niuean terms support reconstruction of a Proto Central Pacific term.

<a id="s-7-6"></a>

### 7.6. Trembling and shivering


There were a number of POc terms for ‘tremble, shiver’. Six of these fall into three pairs. One member of each pair has the skeleton _&ast;rVrV_, the other _&ast;drVdrV_. The pairs are _&ast;riri_ (with variant _&ast;ridriŋ_) and _&ast;dridri_, _&ast;rere_ and _&ast;dredre_ (with variant _&ast;drere_), and _&ast;ruru_ and _&ast;drudru_.[^42]

The fact that there are three pairs of forms is intriguing, and the _&ast;rere_/_&ast;dredre_ and _&ast;ruru_/_&ast;drudru_ pairs appear to have arisen in POc, perhaps through onomatopoeic wordplay.

Of these roots, only _&ast;riri_/_&ast;ridriŋ_ has possible non-Oceanic cognates, and its history and variation in form are discussed in [§4.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8-1#cldf:5-4), as it also occurs in terms for ‘be cold’. Suffice it to say here that the original form of the root was probably POc _&ast;ridriŋ_, but this is reflected in ‘tremble’ forms only in Mangap and Sio. Elsewhere, assimilation has occurred and widespread reflexes of _&ast;riri_ are found, suggesting that this was already an alternant in POc. Only Sio and Marshallese reflect _&ast;dridri_.

The most widely reflected POc term for ‘tremble, shiver’ is _&ast;riri_/_&ast;ridriŋ_. Since this root also occurred in terms for ‘be cold’, one might infer that its earliest meaning was perhaps ‘shiver’, but the glosses of reflexes below suggest that it was used both for trembling with fear and for shivering with cold or a fever.

[POc &ast;_riri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-7-6-324-POc-riri-a)


<a id="p-325"></a>

[POc &ast;_dridri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-7-6-325-POc-dridri-a)

The POc pair _&ast;rere_ and _&ast;dredre_ ‘tremble, shiver’ appear to be an alternant version of the pair _&ast;riri_ and _&ast;dridri_. This is plausible formally, as POc _&ast;e_ only reflects PMP _&ast;-ay_, i.e. in inherited items it occurs only morpheme-finally. Medial POc _&ast;-e-_ is either the outcome of borrowing from a non-Oceanic language or of idiosyncratic innovation. We suggest that it is due to the latter here. Nowhere are both _&ast;rere_ and _&ast;riri_ reflected in a single language, and there is no evident contrast in meaning, beyond the fact that reflexes of _&ast;rere_ have acquired the meaning ‘fear’ in Bel languages (Bilibil etc.) and in Fijian. The Takia phrase _tini-g i-rer_ ‘my skin trembles’ [skin-my it-tremble] shows how the extension of meaning occurred.

The second member of this pair was apparently POc _&ast;dredre_ (with variant _&ast;drere_), but PPn _&ast;tete_ raises a question of form. Was its POc ancestor _&ast;dredre_ or _&ast;dede_? By regular sound change it was _&ast;dede_, but the likely history of the root _&ast;ridriŋ_, reflecting PMP _&ast;diŋdiŋ_ ([§4.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8-1#cldf:5-4)), points to POc _&ast;dr_, not _&ast;d_. We cannot resolve this conflict, but note that the POc consonant _&ast;d_ was rare medially and almost non-existent initially, suggesting that _&ast;dredre_ was modified to _&ast;dede_ in an early Oceanic dialect ancestral to PPn.

The PNCV reflex of POc _&ast;ruru_ (VI) ‘shake’ had acquired the additional sense of ‘earthquake’ ([vol.2:82](ContributionTable?anchor=p-82#cldf:2-3)), but there is no evidence of this elsewhere, and the POc pair _&ast;ruru_ and _&ast;drudru_ do not seem to have differed in meaning from the two pairs above. The form _&ast;drudru_ is reflected only in Remote Oceanic languages. The Polynesian forms may reflect either _&ast;ruru_ or _&ast;drudru_.

In [vol.2:80](ContributionTable?anchor=p-80#cldf:2-3), POc _&ast;ninir_ ‘earthquake’ was reconstructed. Like PNCV _&ast;ruru_ above, this seems to have reflected a verb meaning ‘tremble, shake’. The final _&ast;-r_ is not reflected in the non-Oceanic cognates from which PMP &ast;ninih is reconstructed, and the sets supporting PMP &ast;ninih and POc _&ast;ninir_ may resemble each other by chance.

## 8. Temperature


The reconstruction of terms for ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ is tricky, because the English words have a number of senses for which Oceanic speakers use different words or phrases. The English use of ‘cold’ to denote a sickness is set aside here. Some Oceanic languages distinguish between

a. a person feeling cold (the sense [§4.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8-1#cldf:5-4) is concerned with),
b. a substance being cold to the touch, and
c. the air, wind or weather being cold.

Thus in To’aba’ita the terms are (a) _tega_ or _aqai_, (b) _gʷari_, and (c) _ʔoleʔoleʔa_. However, there is a twist: (a) may also be _gʷa-gʷari_, a reduplicated form of (b) ([Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)).

In Dobu (a) and (c) are both _gogai_, and (b) is _gonituna_, or _goyuyuwana_ if the cold substance is water ([Lithgow & Lithgow 2006](Source#cldf:LithgowandLithgow2006)).

Very few of the available dictionaries differentiate the senses of ‘cold’ as carefully as these two, so there is a data problem. This is compounded, as seen in both To’aba’ita and Dobu, by the fact that a term may span two of the three senses. Much the same is true of words for ‘hot’.


<a id="p-329"></a>

Although it may be assumed that POc made distinctions of the kind listed above, it is not possible to determine accurately how reconstructed terms for ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ related to (a), (b) and (c).


<a id="s-8-1"></a>

### 8.1. Feeling cold


There are several POc forms for ‘cold’ which are derived ultimately from PMP _&ast;diŋin_ ‘cold’. However, Chamorro _maniŋhiŋ_ ‘cold’ reflects PMP _&ast;maN-diŋdiŋ_ ([Blust 1970](Source#cldf:Blust1970):133), and it can be assumed that the POc forms reflect the PMP reduplicated root _&ast;diŋdiŋ_. The expected POc form of the root is _&ast;ridriŋ_, which is plentifully reflected, but this has been subject to assimilations and perhaps metathesis at various post-POc interstages. The root alone is reflected as POc _&ast;ridri(ŋ)_, or _&ast;riri(ŋ)_ ‘shiver’ (with assimilation of medial _&ast;-dr-_ to initial _&ast;r-_), discussed in [§7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6#cldf:5-4).

Forms for ‘cold’ consist of one of the prefixes _&ast;ma-_, _&ast;maN-_ and _&ast;maka-_ + &ast;ridriŋ, giving expected POc forms _&ast;ma-ridriŋ_, _&ast;madridriŋ_ (from _&ast;maN-ridriŋ_) and _&ast;maka-ridriŋ_, all of which are reflected in present-day Oceanic languages. Matters are complicated by the fact that forms are also found which appear to reflect _&ast;ma-ririŋ_, _&ast;madririŋ_, i.e. with medial _&ast;-dr-_ replaced by _&ast;-r-_. There are several possible explanations of these forms, including assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis, but these are ignored here as their distribution in the data suggests that they are local innovations. This means that in a few cases forms reflecting _&ast;ma-ridriŋ_ may have been attributed to _&ast;madridriŋ_, and vice versa.

It is possible that the forms here attributed to POc _&ast;madridriŋ_ are actually all reflexes of _&ast;ma-ridriŋ_ that have undergone assimilation of root-initial _&ast;-r-_ to medial _&ast;dr-_. However, their wide distribution speaks against this. As _&ast;madridriŋ_ reflects _&ast;maN-ridriŋ_, and _&ast;maN-_ has an agentive implication, the question arises, How could a term for ‘cold’ be agentive? The answer is perhaps that it denoted coldness of weather, and there is a sense in which weather can be regarded as agentive (‘causing shivering’): ‘cold (of weather)’ is the gloss assigned to PMP _&ast;maN-diŋdiŋ_ by [Zorc](Source#cldf:Zorc2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:Zorc2007)).

We take _&ast;ma-ridriŋ_ and _&ast;maka-ridriŋ_ both to have meant ‘feel cold’, but their meanings may have been wider than this. No semantic difference between them is discernible.

Another cognate set meaning ‘cold’ appears to reflect both _&ast;malaso_ ‘cold (verb)’ and _&ast;malaso-ŋ_ ‘cold (noun)’.

### 8.2. Feeling hot


Three terms are reconstructable for ‘hot, warm’, POc _&ast;[ma]panas_, POc _&ast;maŋini(t)_ and POc _&ast;tunu-tunu_. The first was probably the general term, to judge from its distribution and its glosses, whilst _&ast;maŋini(t)_ probably had some specialised sense. The third was apparently derived from the verb POc _&ast;tunu_ ‘roast on embers or in fire’ ([vol.1:293](ContributionTable?anchor=p-293#cldf:1-9)).

[PMP &ast;_maN-qinit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-4-8-2-332-POc-mainit-a)

The reflexes of the term below suggest the form †&ast;tun-tunu, but the phonotactics and reduplication patterns of POc require _&ast;tunu-tunu_, even though the second of the four instances of _&ast;-u-_ happens not to be reflected in the cognate set below.

## Notes

[^1]: This reduplicated usage appears to reflect lexicalisation of reduplication that in POc encoded and in many Oceanic languages encodes the imperfective aspect.

[^2]: The root _&ast;susu_ also formed the directly possessed noun ‘breast, milk’ ([§3.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-7#cldf:5-4)).

[^3]: The expected PMP form is †_&ast;paŋaen_, but all known reflexes point to _&ast;paŋan_.

[^4]: Reconstruction of the form _&ast;koda(q)_ is required by the Woleaian, Pulo Annian and Fijian reflexes.

[^5]: Neither source recognised the presence of POc _&ast;kʷ_. On this, see [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross2011) ([2011](Source#cldf:Ross2011)).

[^6]: Neither is reflected in the Papuan Tip cluster, the third section of Western Oceanic.

[^7]: _&ast;qusi_ is reconstructed here rather than _&ast;qusu_ because _&ast;-i_ was added to verb roots in POc to form transitive verbs. Nehan _uhu_ is assumed to reflect loss of _&ast;-i_ followed by echo-vowel addition.

[^8]: [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990)) assigns Nakanai liu ‘drink’ to POc _&ast;iRup_ ‘sip (as soup), slurp’ but [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003):29) point out that it reflects POc _&ast;inum_.

[^9]: However, [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:Blust1993), [2009b](Source#cldf:Blust2009b)) argues that PCEMP/POc _&ast;unum_ should be reconstructed alongside PCEMP/ POc _&ast;inum_ because the lack of western Malayo-Polynesian forms reflecting _&ast;unum_ implies that such forms in CEMP languages are not the result of local changes but of the innovation of a PCEMP variant _&ast;unum_.

[^10]: Oceanic specialists will recognise that this reconstruction entails one or perhaps two phonemes not usually reconstructed for Proto Oceanic (cf [§1.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-4#cldf:5-4).1), namely _&ast;gʷ_ and _&ast;ŋʷ_. [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross2011) ([2011](Source#cldf:Ross2011)) adds to the Proto Oceanic consonant inventory the phoneme _&ast;kʷ_, with a decidedly low token frequency and a tendency to appear in contexts where a phonaesthetic factor is at play. It would not be surprising if _&ast;gʷ_ and _&ast;ŋʷ_ had also occurred, with even lower token frequency.

[^11]: Blust (ACD) does not reconstruct the sense ‘suck (at the breast)’ for PMP _&ast;susu_, but it is clear from the data he cites that it can be reconstructed.

[^12]: Whereas PMP _&ast;-an_ survived as POc _&ast;-an_, a nominaliser, PMP _&ast;-en_ survived only as a fossil in a few nouns like _&ast;pitolon_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-4).5, footnote 33).

[^13]: Anejom _(e)tele_ shows unexpected loss of POc initial _&ast;p-_: the expected form is †_(e)htele_ (John Lynch, pers. comm.)

[^14]: [Clark & Clark](Source#cldf:ClarkandClark1995) ([1995](Source#cldf:ClarkandClark1995)) gloss _rako-ña_ as an intransitive verb, but the presence of the 3SG possessor suffix _-ña_ suggests that it is or has been an adjective ([Ross 1998b](Source#cldf:Ross1998b)).

[^15]: The source of Goodenough’s citation is unclear.

[^16]: _&ast;inem_ ‘drink’ is a rarely reflected variant of _&ast;inum_ ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:5-4).1).

[^17]: The early Austronesian root for ‘sink’ was _&ast;-lem_, and forms derived from this occur in Oceanic languages: Nyindrou (Adm) _-lon_ ‘sink’, Nakanai (MM) _tilomu_ ‘sink, drown’, Sursurunga (MM) _lum_ ‘dive’,‘ _lum-i_ ‘dive to obtain or catch s.t.’, Longgu (SES) _lulumi_ ‘sink’.

[^18]: A final CVC syllable had two moras and accordingly received stress.

[^19]: &ast;[dn] could also have arisen though nasalisation, then extension of voicing, i.e. &ast;[tl] > &ast;[tn] > &ast;[dn].

[^20]: These forms have removed an initial _&ast;tn-_ cluster by deleting initial _&ast;t-_. Cf. footnote 22.

[^21]: Replacement of _&ast;t-_ by Psohoh _k-_ appears to be a case of cluster misinterpretation, noted in (3) earlier.

[^22]: These forms have removed an initial _&ast;tŋ-_ cluster by deleting initial _&ast;t-_. Cf. footnote 20.

[^23]: In certain PT languages _&ast;l_ and _&ast;ŋ_ have both become _n_, so these reflexes are ambiguous as to whether they reflect metathesis or not.

[^24]: In Misima _&ast;l_ and _&ast;ŋ_ have both become _n_. However, _&ast;ŋ_ is lost word-finally, whereas _&ast;l_ isn’t, so _tinon_ reflects PWOc _&ast;toŋol_.

[^25]: In Sissano and Sera n reflects both POc _&ast;n_ and _&ast;ŋ_.

[^26]: Note metathesis: _&ast;tonomo_ > _&ast;tonmo_ > _tomno_. This is probably borrowed from Bugotu.

[^27]: Bender et al. reconstruct PMic _&ast;Toromi_, but the data support _&ast;toromi_ equally well.

[^28]: _&ast;mʷ-_ is reconstructed to account for Mapos Buang mul.

[^29]: Blust (ACD) also cites Ponapean _metik_, _mitik_ ‘kiss’, but the final _-k_ suggests that this is not a native Ponapean term. This leaves no Oceanic evidence for reconstruction of _&ast;-k_.

[^30]: NCV data provided by John Lynch.

[^31]: Transitive forms of Longgu, NE Ambae and Boumaa Fijian in the following sets are from [Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):198.

[^32]: It is tempting to argue that _-usi_ includes a reflex of the transitive suffix _&ast;-i_, but the glosses do not support this, and the form would be irregular, the regular form being †_-isu-i_ or †_-usu-i_.

[^33]: We have chosen to treat Laghu _ki-knisu_ and Blablanga _na-pnisu_ as reflexes of an earlier _&ast;kmisu_, reflected in Kokota and Maringe, rather than of _&ast;kanisu_, but nothing depends on this decision.

[^34]: Non-etymological final consonants are often the result of reanalysis of POc _&ast;-C-i_ as _&ast;-Ci_, then generalisation of one productive variant of _&ast;-Ci_.

[^35]: Wayan _katasivi_ and its derivatives reflect a blend of _kata-_, which occurs in verbs denoting noises from the mouth (_kata-sīsī_ ‘hiss “pssst”’, _kata-som_ ‘signal with a squeaky kissing sound’) and PCP _&ast;kasivi_ ‘spit’ (Andrew Pawley, pers. comm.).

[^36]: Blust reconstructs this form as Proto Western Malayo-Polynesian, but we do not believe that this node existed ([vol.4, ch.1, §3.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-2#cldf:4-1)). Instead, reconstructions at this interstage represent PMP items of which no CEMP reflexes were known at the time of reconstruction. The presence of Oceanic reflexes here confirms the PMP attribution.

[^37]: The New Caledonian items listed here do not reflect POc _&ast;s_ or _&ast;q_. John Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests that they should accordingly be assigned to _&ast;meRe-_, as they regularly lose _&ast;R_.

[^38]: Clark reconstructs _&ast;-r-_. We reconstruct _&ast;-R-_ because François (2011) has shown that _&ast;R_ tends more strongly to be lost the further south one moves in the NCV area, and _&ast;meRes_ adheres to this pattern.

[^39]: NCV forms are from John Lynch (pers. comm.).

[^40]: The indeterminacy of _&ast;-(r,R)_ is present in most PNGOc reconstructions that reflect POc _&ast;r_ or _&ast;R_ as the latter merged in most Western Oceanic languages.

[^41]: [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs PNCV _&ast;malo~&ast;male_ ‘lazy, tired, weak’. The relationship between this and POc _&ast;malu[-malumu]_ is not clear.

[^42]: Of the six forms, only _&ast;ridriŋ_ has a reflex (Mangap _riŋriŋ_) with a final consonant.

[^43]: The only non-Oceanic cognate listed by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Blust1970)) is (CMP) Roti _makalini_ ‘cold’, so the etymon is perhaps only of PCEMP antiquity.

## 1. Introduction


A volume entitled ‘Body and mind’ and devoted to the human person would not be complete without a chapter on words for people. This chapter, however, is restricted to terms for people classified by gender, age cohort and marital status. Terms for kinship and affinal relations and for social rank and leadership will be included in volume 6.

In [§2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:5-2) terms for ‘person’ are presented, in [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:5-2) and [§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:5-2) terms for people classified respectively by gender and by age cohort, in [§2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:5-2) terms for people who lack a certain kinship relation, i.e. a woman with no children, a child with no parents, and an adult who has not married or whose spouse has died. In [§2.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-6#cldf:5-2) terms for twins are given.

Terms for ‘person’, ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘child’ are readily reconstructable. It is evident that Oceanic languages had a number of other terms related to age, and status based on marriage and childbearing. In all Oceanic societies the transition, for both male and female, from childhood to adolescence or marriageable age, and then from the single to the married state, is observed both terminologically and ceremonially ([Pawley 1982b](Source#cldf:Pawley1982b):269-70).

In Manam (NNG), for example, boys are called _nat_ until around 15 years of age. When their hair has been cut (second stage of initiation) they are called _amuna_. This will continue until they marry, when they become _tamoat_. In old age men are called _imanei_ and finally _ikamoan_ ([Böhm 1983](Source#cldf:Bohm1983):239).

A small girl in Manam is also called _nat_. As a young marriageable woman she is _barasi_. A married woman is called _aine_. If she remains unmarried she is called _kosikosi_; if her husband dies the term for a widow is _ŋiŋar_. When she is around 50 years old she is designated _ain molmolu_. An old woman is _ain ikib_ or _manei_. Manam also has terms for a woman’s status in terms of number of children: _biau_ ‘woman with one child’, _pagar_ ‘woman with two or more children’, _kupi_ ‘childless or sterile woman’ ([Böhm 1983](Source#cldf:Bohm1983), wordlist).

In To’aba’ita (SES), _wane_ is the male gender marker and _kini_ or _ai_ the female. _Wela_ is the name for a child regardless of sex, even if one quite big, as long as not married. A newly-married man is _wane fālu_, a newly-married woman _kini fālu_. A married person is _gʷauliʔi wane_ or _gʷauliʔi ai_. The addition of _-ʔa_ to these last two terms means they are ‘somewhat old’ ([Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)).

## 2. Person


There are five POc reconstructions whose reflexes suggest a meaning ‘person’ ([Pawley 1985](Source#cldf:Pawley1985)):

- _&ast;tau_ ‘person in any form, including ghosts and supernatural person-like beings’
- _&ast;tamʷataq ‘living person’ (contrasting with _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘dead person’)
- _&ast;qata_ ‘person’
- _&ast;tinoni_ ‘person, people’
- _&ast;(k,kʷ)a(i)-_ ‘person’

Reflexes of these terms show differences in geographical distribution. Languages of the Southeast and Northwest Solomons reflect _&ast;tinoni_ ‘person, people’ (this distribution may be due to local contact), while languages of Vanuatu and New Caledonia have reflexes of POc _&ast;qata_. POc _&ast;tau-_ and _&ast;qata-_ are also frequently used in compounds.


<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. POc _&ast;tau_


PAn _&ast;Cau_ ‘person’ is a well attested reconstruction, continued as PMP and POc _&ast;tau_. Reflexes of POc _&ast;tau_ occur in three structural contexts:

- as an independent lexical item, typically meaning ‘man’ or ‘person’ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).1);
- as the first item of a compound ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2);
- as the root of a pronominal form ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).3).

The evidence for each of these is discussed below.


<a id="s-2-1-1"></a>

#### 2.1.1. Unbound reflexes of POc _&ast;tau_ ‘person’


In some North New Guinea and Papuan Tip languages (and perhaps in Gela), a reflex of POc _&ast;tau_ may stand alone. Elsewhere reflexes are found only in compounds or pronominals. POc _&ast;tau_ occurred in a considerable number of compounds, and it was a natural process for one of these compounds to become the basic term for ‘person’, displacing _&ast;tau_, especially because ‘living person’ was always in opposition to ‘spirit, ghost’. In Mussau, for example, where _tau_ occurs in compounds, the standalone form for ‘person’ is _tau-matu_, i.e. a compound has replaced _tau_.

The gloss offered below from [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1985) ([1985](Source#cldf:Pawley1985)) takes account of the three types of reflex mentioned above.

<a id="p-39"></a>

[Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) reconstruct PMic _&ast;tau_ ‘person’, but it appears that Micronesian reflexes only occur in the compounds listed here. The first element of the reflexes below is different in form from the reflexes of prefixed PMic _&ast;tawu-_, which remain productive in a number of languages, as illustrated in [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2.

[PMic &ast;_tau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-2-1-39-PMic-tau-a)


<a id="s-2-1-2"></a>

#### 2.1.2. Compounds formed with POc _&ast;tau-_ ‘person who…, person from…’


Compounding with _&ast;tau-_ dates back at least to PMP times, as PMP _&ast;tau-mataq_ shows. Section 2.2.2 is dedicated to POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ ‘living human being’, as it was probably no longer a compound but a single lexeme. Oft reflected early Oceanic compounds with _&ast;tau-_ include POc _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘dead person’ ([§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).2), POc _&ast;tau-paqoRu_ ‘young person of marriageable age’ ([§2.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-3#cldf:5-2)), and PEOc _&ast;tau-tasik_ ‘expert fisherman or sailor’ ([vol.1:207](ContributionTable?anchor=p-207#cldf:1-7) and below). The terms for ‘man’ in Meso-Melanesian languages in the extreme north of New Ireland—Lavongai _tauan_ and Tiang _tauən_—are evidently cognate with Sinaugoro _tauɣani-_ ‘body’ and reflect a PWOc compound _&ast;tau-(q,k)ani_.

Compounding with reflexes of POc _&ast;tau-_ ‘person who…, person from…’, where the second element is typically a verb or a placename, is still somewhat productive in a number of modern languages, and we infer that it was productive in POc. Reflexes of the prefix are listed first, then sample compounds from languages where it is in more frequent use.

SE Solomonic languages do not figure among the examples below, but there is an indication that at least the ‘person from…’ sense was once productive in SE Solomonic, as the fossilised forms Sa’a _au-henue_ ‘be resident in a place, native of a place; inhabitant of a place’ and Arosi _au-henua_ ‘man of the place’ are found, both reflecting POc _&ast;tau-panua_, where _&ast;panua_ meant roughly ‘inhabited place, community’ ([vol.1:18](ContributionTable?anchor=p-18#cldf:1-2), 62; [vol.2:40](ContributionTable?anchor=p-40#cldf:2-3), 295; [Pawley 2005](Source#cldf:Pawley2005)).

<a id="s-2-1-3"></a>

#### 2.1.3. Pronominals formed with POc _&ast;tau-_


POc _&ast;tau-_ occurs as the root of pronominal forms only in Western Oceanic languages. Its basic PWOc function was to form emphatic free pronouns corresponding to English pronouns formed with -self in sentences like He did it himself. It apparently did not form reflexives. However, in a few Papuan Tip languages (indicated below) emphatic forms reflecting _&ast;tau-_ have lost their emphatic value and have displaced inherited free pronouns either throughout the paradigm or, in Duau, in just the third person, or, in Bunama, in the first and third persons.

[PWOc &ast;_tau-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-2-1-42-PWOc-tau-a)


<a id="p-43"></a>

Pronominals formed with POc _&ast;tau-_ usually treat it as a directly possessed root ([§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-2)), as in Yabem, Bunama and Dawawa below. Just two languages appear to use indirect possession with the default alienable possession classifier, Sinaugoro _ɣe-_ and Babatana _na-_.

The Bunama set is the ordinary free pronoun set. Note that Bunama retains inherited second-person free pronouns, but replaces first- and third-person pronouns with the emphatics.

<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ ‘living person’ and POc _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘dead person’


POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ reflects PMP _&ast;tau-mataq_, literally ‘live person’, from _&ast;tau_ ‘person’ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).1) and _&ast;mataq_ ‘raw, new, green’ ([vol.1:155](ContributionTable?anchor=p-155#cldf:1-6)). It was thus the antonym of POc _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘dead person’ (_&ast;mate_ ‘die, dead’, [§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-2).2) and the two were among the many compounds with _&ast;tau_ discussed in [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2.


<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ ‘living person’


It seems likely that POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ had already become a synonym of monosyllabic _&ast;tau_ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).1) in the sense ‘living person’. In several major subgroups – Admiralties, North New Guinea, Fijian, Polynesian – reflexes of _&ast;ta-mʷataq_ are the general term for a human being.


<a id="p-44"></a>

There has been some debate about the form of this reconstruction. Almost all its reflexes point to POc _&ast;tamʷataq_ (or _&ast;tamataq_, as the labial feature of _&ast;mʷ_ has been unstable throughout the history of Oceanic),[^2] but scholars have pointed to Mussau _taumata_ as reflecting POc _&ast;tau-mataq_, the regular reflex of PMP _&ast;tau-mataq_ ‘person’. Either both forms occurred in POc dialects or, as [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1981a) ([1981a](Source#cldf:Blust1981a): 235) implies, the change from _&ast;tau-mataq_ to _&ast;tamʷataq_ had not occurred by the time Mussau (one of two members of a putative small first-order subgroup of Oceanic) separated from the rest of Oceanic. The discussion is in fact perhaps without foundation. The change entailed the coarticulation of the rounding gesture of _&ast;u_ in _&ast;tau-mataq_ with the following _&ast;m_, giving rise to _&ast;mʷ_. No one suggests that the change was a regular one: it isn’t reflected in known reflexes of _&ast;tau-mate_. Rather, it was a lexically specific change in an oft used word. According to the data available to us, the Mussau term for ‘person’ is _taumatu_, not _taumata_, and _taumatu_ is not a reflex of POc †_&ast;tau-mataq_, so the reconstruction of the POc form _&ast;tamʷataq_ is uncontested.

<a id="p-45"></a>


<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. POc _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘dead person’


POc _&ast;tau-mate_ ‘corpse’, from _tau_ ‘person’ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2) and _mate_ ‘die’ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-2).2) is reconstructed on the basis of WOc and Micronesian reflexes. However, given the ubiquity of compounds with _&ast;tau_ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2), it is possible that the term was innovated independently in each of the two areas. The NCV terms are not fully cognate, as they appear to reflect _&ast;qata_ rather than _&ast;tau_ as their first element ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:5-2).2).

[POc &ast;_tau-mate_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-2-2-45-POc-taumate-a)


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. POc _&ast;qata_ ‘person’


There is another reconstruction, POc _&ast;qata_, whose reflexes mean ‘human being’. Like _&ast;tau_ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2)) it is reflected both as an independent noun and as the first part of a number of compounds.


<a id="s-2-3-1"></a>

#### 2.3.1. Unbound reflexes of POc _&ast;qata_ ‘person’


In a note, repeated in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995), [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1972b) ([1972b](Source#cldf:Blust1972b)) reconstructs PMP _&ast;qaRta_ with the meaning ‘outsiders, alien people’. He lists reflexes that include terms of self-designation from Negrito people in Northern Luzon, terms meaning ‘slave’ in a geographically restricted area from the southern Philippines to the Lesser Sundas, and a wide but discontinuous set of terms from Sumatra to Maluku that simply denote ‘man, person’. He includes no Oceanic cognates. He concludes that ‘outsiders, alien people’ is the prior PMP meaning with ‘person’ as a semantic neutralisation in scattered areas.

Putative reflexes of POc _&ast;qata_ meaning ‘person’ occur in Vanuatu and New Caledonia. No Oceanic reflexes carry the Malayo-Polynesian meaning ‘outsider’ except the possible New Caledonian reflexes listed under ‘cf. also’, because they reflect &ast;qataC rather than _&ast;qata_. A reasonable inference is that they reflect a compound consisting originally of _&ast;qata_ and another morpheme. If so, then their meaning does not necessarily attest to the meaning of POc _&ast;qata_.


<a id="p-46"></a>

There are also apparent reflexes of POc _&ast;qata_ which mean ‘soul, spirit’, but [François](Source#cldf:Francois2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Francois2013)) points out that in NCV languages these reflexes are inalienably possessed and have remained separate from reflexes of _&ast;qata_ ‘person’. The homophony is accidental. POc _&ast;qata_ ‘person’ reflects PMP _&ast;qaRta_ ‘outsiders, alien people’, and POc _&ast;qata(r)_ ‘image, reflection, soul, spirit’ reflects PMP _&ast;qatad_ ‘appearance, mark’ ([§3.9.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-9-1#cldf:5-2)).

The North New Guinea reflexes of _&ast;qata_ ‘person’ below function as an emphatic (‘he did it __himself__’; cf. [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).3).

<a id="s-2-3-2"></a>

#### 2.3.2. Compounds formed with POc _&ast;qata-_ ‘person’


A number of POc compounds had _&ast;qata-_ ‘person’ as their first element. They differ from those that had _&ast;tau-_ as their first element. Whereas _&ast;tau-_ is roughly translated ‘person who …’ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2), compounds with _&ast;qata-_ simply denote a person (as _&ast;tamʷataq_ ‘living person’ does; [§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).1) and gender- and age-based categories of human beings. In this section those compounds that denote people in general are presented. Compounds denoting gender-based categories are POc _&ast;qata-mʷaqane_ ‘man, male’ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:5-2)) and POc _&ast;qata-pine_ ‘woman, female’ ([§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:5-2)). Those denoting age-based categories—they are not widely reflected—are Proto SE Solomonic _&ast;qata-natu_ ‘child’ and Proto North–Central Vanuatu _&ast;ta-maraɣai_ ‘old man’ ([§2.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-6#cldf:5-2)). The sense of POc _&ast;qata-mate_ ‘malevolent spirit of a dead person’ suggests that it almost certainly reflects POc _&ast;qata(r)_ ‘image, reflection, soul, spirit’, not POc _&ast;qata_ ‘person’.


<a id="p-47"></a>

[François](Source#cldf:Francois2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Francois2013)) points out that where a term for a category or people begins with _&ast;ta-_, this is potentially ambiguous between an origin in _&ast;qata-_ and one in _&ast;tau-_. However, as just noted, there seems to be a systematic difference in meaning between _&ast;tau-_ and _&ast;qata-_. There is also a phonological difference, as _&ast;tau-_ is usually reflected as _tau-_ or _to-_, and the diphthong _&ast;-au-_ is reflected even in Micronesian languages where there has been substantial phonological change. Prefixed _&ast;qata-_, on the other hand, is reflected as _ta-_ when it loses its first syllable, as it often does.

Most of the following are restricted to a local group of languages. Only PROc _&ast;[qa]ta-maquri_ ‘living person’ (_&ast;maqurip_ ‘be alive’; [§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-2).1) spans a large piece of Oceania, but it has few reflexes and may reflect parallel innovations.

[PROc &ast;_&#91;qa&#93;ta-maquri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-2-3-47-PROc-qatamaquri-a)

The second element of Proto Torres-Banks _&ast;(qa)ta-dunu_ ‘individual, person’ reflects PNCV _&ast;dunu_ ‘true, real’ ([Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)).

### 2.4. POc _&ast;tinoni_ ‘person, people’


Reflexes of POc _&ast;tinoni_ are limited to two subgroups. Apart from Vitu off the north coast of New Britain, all languages listed here are from the Northwest Solomons or the Southeast Solomons where the term apparently has now become the general term for a human being. Its limited range makes it difficult to establish its POc meaning.

As with English ‘man’, reflexes of both _&ast;ta-mʷataq_ and _&ast;tinoni_ may sometimes be used as a term for people in general and sometimes for males only.

<a id="s-2-5"></a>

### 2.5. POc _&ast;(k,kʷ)a(i)_ ‘person’


The reconstruction of POc _&ast;(k,kʷ)a(i)_ ‘person’ is somewhat speculative. This morpheme appears to have meant ‘a person belonging to a certain group’, and was followed by a modifier indicating the identity of that group. It is reflected in this function or something close to it in the Iduna, To’aba’ita, Arosi, Nguna, Bauan and Wayan Fijian terms and perhaps in the plural form PPn _&ast;ka-kai_. The reconstruction is speculative in two respects. First, in Western Oceanic languages in particular, there are numerous forms beginning with _ka-_ which denote a category of person, and we have taken these to be reflexes of _&ast;ka_. Some of them may well have other origins. Where possible the modifier that follows the reflex of _&ast;ka-_ is identified. Second, the form of the reconstruction is uncertain. POc _&ast;kʷa-_ is reflected as far east as Bugotu (with exceptions in Medebur and Bola), switching to _&ast;kʷai-_ from Malaita and Makira eastward.[^4] Reconstruction of initial _&ast;kʷ-_, rather than _&ast;k-_, is also uncertain. POc _&ast;kʷ_ was an unstable phoneme that is reflected as _kʷ_ only in Papuan Tip languages and Western Fijian ([Ross 2011](Source#cldf:Ross2011)). In these and some other languages &ast;kʷa sometimes becomes _&ast;ko_. Among the reflexes below, Iduna _kʷa-na_ and Wayan _koi_ are thus consistent with the reconstruction of POc _kʷa(i)_. Indeed, we have no other explanation for them (other than the possibility that the set below includes some non-cognate forms). Proto Malaita-Makira, however, normally reflects POc _&ast;kʷ-_ as _&ast;k-_, but the forms below instead reflect _&ast;ɣ-_, casting doubt on the reconstruction of POc _&ast;kʷ-_.

## 3. People by gender



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Man, male


Two POc terms are reconstructable reflecting PMP _&ast;ma-Ruqanay_ ‘male, man’. They perhaps occurred in different POc dialects, as no language reflects both. The expected form, POc _&ast;maRuqane_, is reflected in just a few languages, in the Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian linkages of Western Oceanic. Much more widespread is POc _&ast;mʷaqane_, a curiously truncated variant of _&ast;maRuqane_.

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1982b) ([1982b](Source#cldf:Blust1982b)) comments that the origin of the truncated form is problematic. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)) suggests two possible origins. Both assume that _&ast;-R-_ had been irregularly lost (it is sporadically lost in non-Oceanic languages too, perhaps because tetrasyllabic roots were dispreferred). The first hypothesis says that the _&ast;m-_ of _&ast;maRuqane_ became _&ast;mʷ-_ under the influence of _&ast;-u-_. For this to be true, _&ast;-u-_ must have been adjacent to _&ast;m-_, as the two fused as _&ast;mʷ-_ (cf. the discussion of the history of _&ast;tamʷata_ in [§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).1). Lynch suggests that _&ast;maRuqane_ metathesised to †_&ast;muRaqane_, This would have been followed by loss of _&ast;-R-_, giving †_&ast;muaqane_, leading to _&ast;mʷaqane_.

Lynch also offers an alternative explanation whereby _&ast;maRuqane_ formed a compound _&ast;tau-maRuqane_, giving rise to _&ast;tamʷaRuqane_ (cf. [§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).1), which was then reanalysed, leaving _mʷaRuqane_ as a separate morpheme with initial _&ast;mʷ-_. Of the two explanations, the first is more explanatory, as the second fails to explain loss of _&ast;-u-_. There is in any case evidence that forms that might be taken to reflect _&ast;tau-maRuqane_ actually reflect _&ast;qata-mʷaqane_.


<a id="p-51"></a>

The few forms that reflect _&ast;maRuqane_ all mean ‘male, man’. There is good evidence that POc _&ast;mʷaqane_ had two uses. As an independent noun, it meant ‘male, man’, but as a directly possessed noun ([§3.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-1#cldf:5-2)) it meant ‘brother of a woman’. It appears with this sense in the Admiralties and across Remote Oceanic, establishing its POc origin.

<a id="p-52"></a>

The following POc reconstruction is a compound of _&ast;qata_ ‘person’ and POc _&ast;mʷaqane_ ‘man, male’ (cf. [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:5-2).2), based on numerous reflexes, many of which show reduction of form in various ways, commonly by deleting _&ast;qa-_. Polynesian languages have deleted _&ast;-mʷa-_. Only two widely separated reflexes, Nakanai (MM) and Anejom (SV) share the meaning ‘brother of woman’, but, given that POc _&ast;mʷaqane_ had this sense, it is reasonable to attribute it also to POc _&ast;qata-mʷaqane_.

There is also reasonable evidence for a shortened form of POc _&ast;qata-mʷaqane_ ‘man, male’ in New Guinea Oceanic, namely PNGOc _&ast;qata-mʷaq(a)_ ‘man, male’.

### 3.2. Woman


The terms for ‘woman, female’ present one of the most challenging reconstructive tasks in Austronesian historical linguistics, with a number of terms derived from PAn _&ast;bahi_ ‘woman, female’. ([Blust 1982b](Source#cldf:Blust1982b), ACD).[^6] Although POc reflects only two of the many variants reflected in non-Oceanic languages, namely _&ast;pine_ and _&ast;papine_, it has generated variants of its own. With some exceptions, most in Vanuatu, _&ast;pine_ occurs only in the compounds presented below.


<a id="p-54"></a>

In Bugotu and Gela (both SES) the regular reflex of _&ast;papine_ means ‘opposite-sex sibling’, and across SE Solomonic the term for ‘woman’ reflects POc _&ast;paipine_, a variant that remains unexplained. In a number of Papuan Tip reflexes of _&ast;papine_ and _&ast;paipine_ initial _&ast;p-_ is replaced by _&ast;w-_, again an unexplained change.

Corresponding to _&ast;qata-mʷaqane_ ‘man’ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:5-2)) is POc _&ast;qata-pine_, a compound of _&ast;qata_ ‘person’ and POc _&ast;pine_ ‘woman, female’ (cf. [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:5-2).2). No five-syllable reflexes of POc †_&ast;qata-papine_ ‘woman, female’ have been found. Like other compounds in _&ast;qata-_, the first element is often reduced to _ta-_.

[POc &ast;_qata-pine_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-3-2-56-POc-qatapine-a)

Data from the westerly part of the north coast of New Guinea point to a variant _&ast;mapine_ for _&ast;papine_:

## 4. People by age cohort



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Oceanic age cohort terms


There is a framework of single-word terms for age cohorts that seems to have a similar structure in many Oceanic languages. The basic elements are:

 1.    young person, the age range of which often stretches from birth to adulthood
 2.    person of marriageable age, typically two terms, female and male
 3.    fully grown adult
 4.    mature middle-aged adult, typically two terms, female and male
 5.    very old person

It is sometimes difficult to align terms from different languages, first because in most dictionaries age cohort terms appear to be incompletely listed, and secondly because dictionaries typically give only relative ages,[^7] and definitions like ‘young girl’ are vague. However, the five basic terms in an eight-language sample are laid out in [Table 13](#table-13).[^8]

Several observations are in order. The empty cells in [Table 13](#table-13) marked with ‘…’ might be filled if the data were more complete, but the empty cells marked with ‘—’ are probably artefacts of our representation of gender-related terms. For example, Mutu has _kōŋ_ ‘mature person’, but apparently no dedicated terms for ‘mature man’ or ’mature woman’. To’aba’ita has gender-specific terms for (marriageable) young adults, but apparently no genderless term for ‘young adult’. Numbami and Mwotlap stand out from the other languages in the table in that they have a larger number of gender-specific terms. These are shown with a slash, thus feminine/masculine. Several To’aba’ita terms are basically verbs. Thus darā means ‘be a marriageable young man’.

Terms for ‘young person’, labelled ‘1’ in [Table 13](#table-13), typically embrace an age range from birth to the onset of adulthood which is divided into smaller categories by either using the ‘young person’ term with modifiers (Khehek, Numbami, Nehan and Wayan) or using further single-word terms. These are shown in [Table 14](#table-14). The exception here is Mwotlap, where the ‘young person’ term does not include children below about six years of age and as a result fewer terms are formed with modifiers.

The basic divisions in [Table 14](#table-14) are (1a) baby, (1b) prepubescent child and (1c) adolescent. This tabulation is not exhaustive. Wayan also has the terms _driadria tabatūtū_ ‘infant learning to stand’ and _driadria kakarebareba_ ‘toddler’. To’aba’ita has _wela kōkosa_ or _wela ʔāʔabu_ ‘newborn baby’, _wela kā_ ‘baby that can crawl’ and _wela ʔāʔaru_ ‘toddler’. Paamese has titali ‘infant sitting up’. Mutu apparently singles out children aged around four or five as _kukua_. Since the ‘young girl/young boy’ terms in Mwotlap designate young people from around six years of age upward, a separate term _nɪ-nɪtmʷəy_ denotes children under six. Mwotlap also has a term _n-ɛt su_ [ART-person little] ‘children’ contrasting with _n-ɛt liwɔ_ [ART-person big] ‘adults’.

<a id="p-60"></a>

With one exception, there is little cognacy across the eight languages in the tables above, yet the categories appear similar, and it is a reasonable inference that POc had such categories. The exception is that ‘fully grown adult’ is often designated by the term that means ‘person’. The POc term denoting a fully grown adult was thus probably _&ast;tamʷata_ ‘person’ ([§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).1), reflected above in Numbami, Nehan and Wayan. We also hypothesise that where POc age cohort terms distinguished gender, they did so using &ast;papine ‘female’ ([§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:5-2)) and _&ast;mʷaqane_ ‘male’ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:5-2)) as modifiers. The evidence for this is somewhat circumstantial, but see To’aba’ita _ila wane_ ‘married man’, _wēwelani-wane_ ‘young boy’, Paamese _ahin_ ‘adult woman’, and Wayan _driadria taŋʷane_ ‘young boy’.

The lack of cognacy among age cohort terms partly reflects shifts in meaning over time. Thus Khehek (Adm) _kxikxiŋ_ ‘fully grown adult’ and Wayan (Fij) _driadria_ ‘young person’ appear to be cognate.

Below, reconstructions for age cohorts are discussed under the headings used in Tables 13 and 14. Reconstruction in this semantic domain is not easy, as a wealth of local terms for age cohorts are found but few terms that have survived across a number of Oceanic primary subgroups


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Young person from birth to onset of adulthood


The English word ‘child’ has two meanings: (1) offspring and (2) young boy or girl. Thus (1) denotes a kin relationship, (2) an age group. The POc term for sense (1), ‘offspring’, is _&ast;natu-_, a kin term (see vol.6).

Oceanic languages typically have no single-word term corresponding to English ‘childʼ in sense (2) but instead have a term for human beings from birth to the onset of adulthood. POc &ast;meRa appears to have been the term denoting this age group. A number of its reflexes are glossed simply ‘child’, but we suspect that this is a product of wordlist collecting, where the informant is simply asked for the term corresponding to English ‘child’. Evidence that POc _&ast;meRa_ did mean ‘person from birth to adulthood’ is found in the To’aba’ita and ’Are’are dictionary entries below and in the generalisation of some of its NCV reflexes to mean something like English ‘fellow, guy’, i.e. a colloquial way of referring to men in particular.

The origin of POc _&ast;meRa_ was pointed out to us by Charles Grimes (pers. comm.). In a number of CMP languages the term for a newborn is ‘red child’, and in some of these the term ‘red’ reflects PMP _&ast;ma-iRaq_ ‘red’ (ACD). In PCEMP and POc this became _&ast;meRaq_ ‘red’ ([vol.2:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:2-7); ACD). The terms below are drawn from a geographically well distributed range of CMP languages.[^9] The association between ‘red’ and ‘newborn’ seems to have been lost in early Oceanic, but POc _&ast;meRa_ seems to have had the specific meaning ‘newborn’ (see Misima and Arosi glosses) and the metonomic usage ‘young person from birth to onset of adulthood’.


<a id="p-61"></a>

[PCEMP &ast;_anak meRaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-61-POc-mera-a)


<a id="p-62"></a>

It is possible that the apparent PNCV doublet _&ast;mʷara_ above is the product of reflexes of _&ast;mʷera_ that have undergone contamination by reflexes of POc _&ast;mʷala_ ‘young unmarried woman’ ([§2.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-3#cldf:5-2)).

A few languages have distinct single-word terms for ‘boy’ and ‘girl’, but they are few and far between. POc seems simply to have used the terms for ‘male’ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:5-2)) and ‘female’ ([§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:5-2)) alone or as modifiers to a ‘young person’ term, as in ’Are’are (SES) _mera māne_ ‘boy’ and _mera keni_ ‘girl’.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. Baby, infant, newborn


POc apparently had two terms for ‘baby’, _&ast;meRa-meRa_ and _&ast;kʷawaq_. No language has been found in which they contrast. The use of reduplication in POc for a diminutive or a small version of the denotatum of the root was noted in [vol.3:50](ContributionTable?anchor=p-50#cldf:3-2)–51. POc _&ast;meRa-meRa_ thus meant ‘baby, very young child’, a small version of _&ast;mʷeRa_ ‘young person from birth to onset of adulthood’ ([§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:5-2)). Polynesian reflexes are often modifiers of a reflex of PPn _&ast;tama_ ‘child’.[^11]

[POc &ast;_meRa-meRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-62-POc-meramera-a)


<a id="p-63"></a>

POc _&ast;kʷawaq_ seems also to have meant ‘baby, small child’. Initial _&ast;kʷa-_ is reconstructed to account for Dawawa and Misima _wa-_. In several languages the _&ast;-a-_ of the first syllable is reflected as a rounded vowel. This can be attributed either to _&ast;kʷa-_ or to the _&ast;-w-_ that follows it.

[POc &ast;_kʷawaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-63-POc-kawaq-a)


<a id="s-4-2-2"></a>

#### 4.2.2. Child


No term is reconstructable for ‘child’, i.e., a person up to the onset of puberty, although many languages have one-word terms. However, a theme that runs through certain Oceanic subgroups is that the term for ‘child’ consists of what is or once was a term for ‘person’ modified by a term for ‘little’ or it consists just of the term for ‘little’ alone. Forms for ‘little’ were reconstructed in [vol.2:193](ContributionTable?anchor=p-193#cldf:2-7)–195:


<a id="p-64"></a>

- POc _&ast;liki_ ‘small’, perhaps only in compounds
- POc _&ast;qitik_, _&ast;qitek_ ‘small’
- POc _&ast;kiki_ ‘small’
- POc _&ast;rikit_
- PWOc _&ast;siki_ ‘small’

POc _&ast;liki_ ‘small’ occurs perhaps only in compounds, and is present in the items listed below. The Madak, Sursurunga and Bilur forms apparently reflect PWOc _&ast;kʷa[i]_ ([§2.2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-5#cldf:5-2)) as their first element, whilst the first element in Patpatar and Proto Polynesian reflects POc _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’, where the child is construed as the small member in the father–child relationship.

[POc &ast;_-liki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-64-POc-liki-a)

There is good evidence that Proto Polynesian distinguished between singular _&ast;tama-qiti_ ‘child’ (< POc _&ast;qitik_) and plural _&ast;tama-riki_ ‘children’ (< POc _&ast;rikit_).

[POc &ast;_qitik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-64-POc-qitik-a)

The Nehan item immediately above appears to reflect _&ast;tiki_, which may in turn reflect a metathesis of _&ast;qitik_.

[POc &ast;_rikit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-2-65-POc-rikit-a)

<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Young (unmarried) person


Although [Table 14](#table-14) shows category (1c) ‘adolescent, not yet marriageable’, there is no evidence that POc speakers treated this as a category separate from ‘young unmarried person’. The lower bound of this category was puberty, the upper bound marriage. Note that in Wayan Fijian, for example, the term for (1c) is compound, _dridria saravou_ i.e. ‘young person’ + ‘marriageable young man’, i.e. (1c) represents an overlap between ‘young person’ and ‘marriageable young man’, post-puberty but not quite old enough for marriage.

The most widely reflected expression for a young (unmarried) person consists of a word for ‘person’ (perhaps POc _&ast;tau_; [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).1), sometimes omitted, and a reflex of POc _&ast;paqoRu_ ‘new, young, recent’). The ‘young, unmarried’ sense was already present in PAn _&ast;baqeRuh_ (ACD).

A second term for an unmarried young person, apparently a young woman, is POc _&ast;mʷala_. The gloss is based on the agreement of the North New Guinea and North–Central Vanuatu glosses below. PNCV _&ast;mʷala-gelo_ also has a modifier of unknown meaning as its second element, and [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) concludes that _&ast;mʷala-gelo_ probably denoted a young male. The glosses of his supporting data (below) would equally well support the gloss ‘young adult’, however.

### 4.4. Fully grown adult


As mentioned in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:5-2) the POc term denoting a full-grown adult was probably _&ast;tamʷata_ ‘person’ ([§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:5-2).1).

Wayan Fijian, at least, distinguishes life-stage terms from marriage-related terms (Andrew Pawley, pers. comm.). It is uncertain whether this is true of many Oceanic languages, but the weight of the evidence points in that direction, as languages tend not to have a lifestage (as opposed to kin) term denoting ‘married man’ or ‘married woman’. As most adult men and women in Oceanic communities are married, they are referred to by the unmarked terms for ‘man’ or ‘woman’. These are typically reflexes of _&ast;mʷaqane_/_&ast;qatamʷaqane_ ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:5-2)) and _&ast;papine_/_&ast;qatapine_ ([§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:5-2)).


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Mature person


Most Oceanic languages seem to distinguish at least two stages of mature adulthood, one for people of perhaps 30–50, i.e. vigorous adults with unmarried children, and another for people older than perhaps 50 or 60 and no longer so vigorous.[^12] Vigour is probably more important than age here. In Wayan Fijian a still active 60-year-old is _uabula_, i.e. ‘mature’ rather than ‘old’. A difficulty in the data is that ‘old’ tends to be used indiscriminately in definitions of both categories. Sometimes one category is labelled ‘old’, the other ‘very old’. Sometimes ‘mature’ is used, and this is taken to be an indicator of the younger category.

The most widespread cognate set for a ‘mature person’ reflects POc _&ast;matuqa_ ‘mature, full-grown, ripe, old (person)’. Only reflexes that denote a person are listed here. POc _&ast;matuqa_ was evidently originally a stative verb, and in some languages it occurs as modifier of (the reflex of) a term meaning ‘person’. In the Huon Gulf languages of Western Oceanic, it has become the usual term for ‘man’.

<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Old person


For ‘old person’ POc _&ast;mʷarap_ (V) ‘grow old’, (N) ‘old person’ and _&ast;tobʷan_ ‘old person’ are tentatively reconstructed.

On evidence from Papuan Tip languages POc _&ast;mʷarap_ was originally a verb. It retains a verbal use in Gapapaiwa. In Muyuw, Kilivila and Budibud it is prefixed with a classifier, _ta-_/_to-_ for human males (< POc _&ast;tau-_ ‘person who…; [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2) or _na-_ for human females ([Lawton 1993](Source#cldf:Lawton1993):184–185). Prefixal classifiers are generally affixed to modifiers in noun phrases in this group of languages, indicating that the root is a verb ‘be(come) old’.


<a id="p-69"></a>

Final _&ast;-p_ of _&ast;mʷarap_ is regularly reflected in Gapapaiwa and is perhaps also responsible for the rounding of the final vowel in SE Solomonic languages.

The NCV items are listed under ‘cf. also’ because it is uncertain whether they are cognate. [François](Source#cldf:Francois2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Francois2013)) takes them to reflect _&ast;maraɣai_ ‘to tremble’ with prefixed _&ast;ta-_ (< _&ast;qata_ ‘person’). If his etymology is correct, then the resemblance of the PNCV reconstruction to the POc reconstruction must be attributed to chance.

[POc &ast;_mʷarap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-4-6-69-POc-marap-a)

POc _&ast;tobʷan_ ‘old woman (?), old person’ was probably a noun, and its first syllable probably reflects POc _&ast;tau-_ ‘person who… ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-2).2).

## 5. People by absence of relationship


Kinship relationships will be discussed in vol.6. The terms below denote a person who lacks a particular relationship. English has such terms: ‘orphan’, ‘widow[er]’, ‘spinster’, ‘bachelor’. Oceanic languages have terms with these meanings and more. For example, in Mutu (NNG) we find _kakam_ ‘woman whose child has died’, _māⁿduat_ ‘man whose child has died’, _kulīŋ_ ‘man whose sibling has died’ and _silūn_ ‘woman whose sibling has died’.


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Orphan


Despite the glosses of the data below, we take POc _&ast;mad(r)awa_ to be a stative (adjectival) verb, as suggested by the prefix _&ast;ma-_ ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-2).4). The 3SG agreement marker of Arop-Lukep _madu(nu)_ also suggests that it is an adjective rather than a noun.

<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Unmarried person


POc _&ast;jamu_ ‘person without spouse’ evidently denoted spinsters, bachelors, widows and widowers. Regular reflexes are confined to SES and one MM language. Manam _amuna_ appears to be a cognate, but is missing a reflex of initial _&ast;j-_.

### 5.3. Widow, widower


Blust (ACD) reconstructs two distinct but similar forms for POc, labelling them both ‘widow(er)’. Either they were alternant forms of the same lexeme, or they contrasted with regard to the sex of the denotatum. The one piece of evidence that helps us out here is the contrast between Sori _ñaw_ ‘widow’ and _ñah_ ‘widower’. If this contrast is a retention, then we can gloss the reconstructions accordingly. However, Blust is rightly cautious, as pairs that distinguish gender by a change in the wordform are otherwise unheard of in Oceanic languages.

[POc &ast;_ñaro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-5-3-71-POc-naro-a)


<a id="p-72"></a>

Also reconstructable is PWOc _&ast;kʷabu(r,R)_ ‘widow or widower’. One wonders how it differed in meaning from the term above. [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) gives us a possible clue. After the death of one’s spouse, in Arosi one is nao. Only after a lengthy fast from certain foods does one become eligible for remarriage and acquire a new status, Arosi _oʔoura_ (which does not reflect _&ast;kʷabu(r,R)_, however).

## 6. Twins


Three POc terms for ‘twins’ are reconstructed. The first is POc _&ast;bʷege_ or _&ast;boge_. The form is ambiguous, as it takes only a simple sound change to get from one to the other. A second term was based on the POc root _&ast;saŋa_ ‘be branching or forked; branch (of tree, river, path), fork, crotch)’ ([vol.3:96](ContributionTable?anchor=p-96#cldf:3-4)). It occurs in two variants: (a) a reduplicated form, probably _&ast;saŋa-saŋa_, and a stative verb form derived with _&ast;ka-_/_&ast;ma-_ (variants of the same prefix: see [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-2).4). These terms can be used to identify various objects that carry the meaning ‘two parts of one whole’. Thus they may refer to a double nut or double banana as well as twins. Also reconstructed is POc _&ast;apic_ ‘twins of the same sex’.

[PMP &ast;_saŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-2-6-None-73-POc-saasaa-a)

Finally, Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _&ast;apic_ ‘twins of the same sex’. Only one Oceanic reflex is known. This is perhaps because the sense is so specialised that other cognates have not been collected.

## Notes

[^1]: The gloss is from [Chowning and Goodenough](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2014)). We have no examples.

[^2]: For discussion, see [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1984b) ([1984b](Source#cldf:Blust1984b)) and [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)).

[^3]: PEMP _&ast;tinoni_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic reflexes here and two West New Guinea reflexes, Biak _snon_ 'man', Dusner _snon_ 'male'.

[^4]: We have asked ourselves whether _&ast;kʷai-_ reflects _&ast;kʷa qi_, where _&ast;qi_ is the marker of nonspecific possession that follows a directly possessed noun. This would mean that _&ast;kʷa_ was directly possessed, as it appears to be in Iduna. But the expected form would then be _&ast;kʷaqi_, not _&ast;kʷai_.

[^5]: ‘May occur alone or in compound as male gender marker or to further identify s.o.’

[^6]: Oceanic forms are derived from PMP _&ast;b⟨in⟩ahi_, a form of the root _&ast;bahi_ infixed with _&ast;⟨in⟩_ PERFECTIVE.

[^7]: Exceptions are [François](Source#cldf:Francois2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:Francois2012)) and [Pawley & Sayaba](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)).

[^8]:  Thanks go to Alexandre François, who provided us with terms in Mwotlap and other Torres/Banks languages.

[^9]: Our thanks to Charles Grimes for data and notes.

[^10]: Given that [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) also glosses reduplicated _mʷera mʷera_ as ‘very small child’, we wonder whether his gloss of _mʷera_ is erroneous.

[^11]: PPn _&ast;tama_ ‘child’ is derived from POc _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’, enshrining a development whereby _&ast;tama_ came to denote the reciprocal relationship between father and child. Note Gela _tama_ ‘prefix of reciprocal relation’, e.g. _tama-dale_ ‘father and children’, _tama-kukua_ ‘a man and his grandparents’, _tama-vavineni_ ‘sister and brother’; Bauan _vei-tama-ni_ (V) ‘be related as father and child’, (N) ‘father and child’.

[^12]: Since Oceanic traditional societies did not count birthdays, these figures are of necessity very approximate. Furthermore, modern increases in life expectancy have almost certainly changed the age ranges which these terms denote.

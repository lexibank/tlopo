## 1. Introduction


This chapter presents reconstructions of POc verbs for acts performed with the body or its parts that do not readily fit into the volume’s other chapters. It is, in a sense, a collection of leftovers, but it is a collection that has lessons to teach us.

Terminological reconstruction uses the terminologies of present-day speakers of Oceanic languages as the basis for constructing a hypothesis about the semantic structure of a corresponding POc terminology. This is relatively easy to do if we are reconstructing a set of nouns, like terms for the parts of a canoe ([vol.1, ch.7](ContributionTable#cldf:1-7)) or the parts of the human body (this volume, ch.3), as these are objects or entities that can be identified visually. It is more difficult when the terms to be reconstructed consist of classes of objects or entities, and class boundaries are determined by cultural and environmental factors, as is true, for example, of plant ([vol.3, ch.3](ContributionTable#cldf:3-3)) and animal taxonomies (vol.4, chs.3 and 8), of the times of the day ([vol.2:294](ContributionTable?anchor=p-294#cldf:2-8)–304), and of human age cohorts (this volume, [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:5-7)).

Such classifications differ from one part of the world to another, and sometimes differ across Oceanic communities too. But these classifications can often also be related to objects or entities that have material existence. Verbs, however, denote events and states. Some of the semantic distinctions they make relate to events with physical components (‘winds blow’, ‘people urinate’), but others are more abstract. The more abstract they are, the more careful we need to be not to assume that distinctions encoded by English verbs are similarly encoded by verbs in Oceanic languages and the more semantic change we find reflected across Oceanic cognate sets. To draw examples from this short chapter, Oceanic languages tend to encode ‘beckon’ and ‘wave’ by the same verbs ([§7.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-3-1#cldf:5-7)), and this is also true of ‘slap’ and ‘clap’ ([§7.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4-1#cldf:5-7)). Acts of washing in Oceanic languages defy single-verb English translations ([§7.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6#cldf:5-7)).

The somewhat abstract nature of verb meanings means that the internal classification and even the grammatical encoding of a whole domain may be quite different from its classification and encoding in English. For example, many Oceanic languages use serial verb constructions to encode movement, thereby partitioning meanings into manner of movement, geographic direction of movement, and deictic direction of movement ([vol.2:256](ContributionTable?anchor=p-256#cldf:2-8)–283 and this volume, §[§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-7)–6.4), with verbs (or directional morphemes) that occupy each slot in the construction.

A second effect of the abstract nature of verb meanings, however, is that verbs cannot always be neatly assigned to terminologies, as they sometimes overlap more than one semantic domain. Verbs meaning ‘wait’ and ‘hide’ both have a location component. In this they resemble the posture verbs discussed in [§6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:5-7), but neither has a posture component. Instead, ‘wait’ has a component of expectation which in certain contexts allows interpretation as a verb of cognition (ch.10), whilst intransitive ‘hide’ resembles a location verb ([§6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:5-7)) and transitive ‘hide’ a putting verb ([§6.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6-3#cldf:5-7).1), but both entail the element of concealment from certain people.


<a id="p-458"></a>

Most of the verbs in this section are verbs that defy neat assignment. Verbs of working ([§7.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2-2#cldf:5-7)) arguably belong with the verbs associated with horticultural practices ([vol.1:129](ContributionTable?anchor=p-129#cldf:1-5)–134), as POc speakers—unsurprisingly—had no concept corresponding to ‘work’ in its western sense. The closest equivalent was ‘work in the food garden’. The pair of verbs meaning ‘clap hands’ and ‘slap with open hand’ in [§7.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4-1#cldf:5-7) properly belongs with verbs of hitting in [vol.1:267](ContributionTable?anchor=p-267#cldf:1-9)–274, and is a corrigendum in the light of more data to a reconstruction presented there.

All the reconstructions in this chapter denote physical acts, beginning in [§7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2#cldf:5-7) with the most general of these, verbs of doing and working. Then follow two sections on actions done with the hand or arm: beckoning, waving, fanning, seizing and taking hold of, and grasping and holding ([§7.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-3#cldf:5-7)), clapping, slapping and tickling ([§7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4#cldf:5-7)). Section 7.5 contains verbs of stamping and treading on, these being the only foot and leg actions that do not fit neatly into manner-of- movement verbs in [§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-7). Section 7.6 similarly deals with actions in water that do not belong in the Oceanic manner-of-movement category. Section 7.7 contains the verbs of waiting and hiding briefly discussed above.

## 2. Doing and working



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Doing


Probably every Oceanic language has a verb meaning ‘do’. Its most common use is with a nominal object denoting an activity, especially in phrases meaning ‘do work’. In many languages it also occurs in the question ‘What are you doing?’ but this usage is somewhat less widespread, as a number of Oceanic languages have an interrogative verb ‘do what?’.

It is clear that POc _&ast;pai(t)_/_&ast;pait-i-_ can be reconstructed, but it is striking that there are large geographic gaps in the distribution of its reflexes, pointing to widespread lexical replacement leading to numerous local cognate sets but none that unambiguously reconstructs to PROc, PEOc or PWOc, let alone POc. This is probably a result of the fact that in ‘do’ + nominal syntagms, ‘do’ is frequent and typically unstressed. It is therefore subject to phonological reduction which encourages replacement. There is, for example, a scattering of forms with the template _&ast;gV_: Takia (NNG) _-ga[ne]_, Iduna (PPT) _-ga_, Nakanai (MM) _igo_, all meaning ‘do, make’, and Tolo (SES) _ago_ ‘work’, but their monosyllabicity and the mismatches among their vowels suggest that they could readily be due to independent parallel development.

<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Working


Pre-contact Oceanic languages had no term for ‘work’ in its Western senses of ‘work as opposed to leisure’ or ‘work as gainful employment’. The closest concept, and one the term for which has in some languages been extended to include gainful employment, is that of labouring in the garden to grow food crops, and especially working to clear land for a garden.

The POc verb for ‘work in the food garden’ was identical in form to the noun for ‘food garden’ ([vol.1:117](ContributionTable?anchor=p-117#cldf:1-5)–118), _&ast;quma_.

[PAn &ast;_qumah_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-2-2-459-POc-quma-a)


<a id="p-460"></a>

The terms for ‘food garden’ in three MM languages are nominalisations formed with the nominalising infix _&ast;⟨in⟩_ and _&ast;quma_, indicating that in the early MM linkage, _&ast;quma_ was a verb meaning ‘make a garden’. The three forms that reflect _&ast;q⟨in⟩uma_ ‘garden’ are Bulu _ɣ⟨in⟩uma_, Kia _(n-un)uma_ and Roviana _(in)uma_, all ‘food garden’.

A second term for working in the garden is found in a number of PT languages and MM languages of northern New Ireland which appears to reflect WOc _&ast;pai-sok_, _&ast;pai-sok-i_ ‘plant (tuber +)’.

[PWOc &ast;_pai-sok_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-2-2-460-PWOc-paisok-a)


<a id="p-461"></a>

The etymology of these terms is complex and not entirely clear. Their shape suggests that they reflect a compound, as morpheme-internal _&ast;-ai-_ is not a usual part of the POc phonological template. An obvious candidate for the first morpheme is POc _&ast;pai(t)_ ‘do, make’, reconstructed above in [§7.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2-1#cldf:5-7). However, the MM forms bear an obvious resemblance to the set reflecting POc _&ast;paso(k)_, _&ast;pasok-i_ below, an expanded version of the set in [vol.1:132](ContributionTable?anchor=p-132#cldf:1-5). POc _&ast;paso(k)_ has a history as a unitary morpheme, and to account for PWOc _&ast;pai-sok_, folk etymologising must be assumed, whereby _&ast;paso(k)_ was reanalysed as _&ast;pa-(a)so(k)_, consisting of _&ast;pa-_, the POc causativiser, and the root POc _&ast;asok_ ‘plant in holes in the ground’ (ACD).[^1] The prefix _&ast;pa-_ was then replaced by _&ast;pai-_.

[PAn/PMP &ast;_pasek_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-2-2-461-POc-pasok-a)

There remains the question of the origin of the apparent PT reflexes of PWOc _&ast;pai-sok_ listed above. First, a majority of PT languages reflects an innovation whereby _&ast;-a_ is added after a PWOc final consonant, i.e. PWOc _&ast;paisok_ > _&ast;paisoka_. There is also a tendency for _&ast;k_ to become _&ast;kʷ_ next to a rounded vowel, hence _&ast;paisokʷa_. Medial _&ast;-k-_ was deleted through lenition, giving _&ast;paisowa_, the form reflected by Bunama _paihowa_. Finally, vowel unrounding adjacent to a rounded consonant (_&ast;w_, _&ast;kʷ_ etc) is widespread in PT, giving _&ast;paisewa_.

## 3. Hand and arm actions


Hand and arm actions for which reconstructions are given in this section include beckoning and waving (often the same verb), fanning, taking hold of, seizing by force, and holding something in one’s hand. Verbs meaning ‘point (at)’ are not given here but are listed as part of the cognate set supporting POc _&ast;tusu-_ (N) ‘forefinger’; _&ast;tusuq-i-_ (VT) ‘point at’ in [§3.6.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6-8#cldf:5-7).2.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Beckoning and waving


POc speakers perhaps had two beckoning gestures. In one, the hand was extended palm down, in the other, hand up. In traditional Oceanic societies (and in SE Asia), the beckoning palm down is the polite gesture, whilst beckoning palm up, European-style, particularly with an extended forefinger, is considered rude. There are a few indications among the glosses of reflexes (Babatana, Longgu, Marshallese) that POc _&ast;qalo(p)_, _&ast;qalop-i-_ denoted beckoning with the palm down. However, it seems possible that it also had the generic meaning of waving or making hand gestures.

Alongside POc _&ast;qalo(p)_ we also find _&ast;ta(Ra)-qalo(p)_ (VI) ‘beckon, wave’. The function of the prefixed element is not understood,[^2] and it is not clear how the prefixed and intransitive unprefixed forms differ in meaning.

[POc &ast;_ta(Ra)-qalo(p)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-1-463-POc-taraqalop-a)

POc _&ast;kamo(t)_, _&ast;kamot-i-_ may have denoted the impolite beckoning style, with the palm turned up and forefinger extended, but this is attested only by the Kove gloss. In Polynesian languages reflexes of this term denote both hand and eye signals. The Rennellese reflex denotes the polite beckoning style, but this may be the result of an extension in meaning from impolite beckoning to hand and eye signals in general.

<a id="p-464"></a>

[PPn &ast;_kamo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-1-464-PPn-kamo-a)

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;away_ ‘beckon with the hand’ and PMP _&ast;kaway_ ‘wave the hand or arms; call by waving’. The morphological relationship between the two is uncertain: they may reflect the same Austronesian root ([Blust 1988](Source#cldf:Blust1988)). A few Oceanic reflexes of _&ast;kaway_ are found, allowing reconstruction of POc _&ast;kawe_ ‘wave the hand’. There are also reflexes of an apparent POc _&ast;dawe_, perhaps descended from a PMP form reflecting the same Austronesian root, but in the absence of non-Oceanic reflexes this can be reconstructed only to PNGOc.

[PNGOc &ast;_dawe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-1-464-PNGOc-dawe-a)


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Fanning


The commonest fan in Oceanic speaking communities is probably one made from the coconut frond.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;iri(p)_, _&ast;irip-i-_ (V) ‘fan’ and its nominalisations are common in EOc languages. If the analysis of Lou _tɛrip_ and Nyindrou _taleh_ as reflexes of the root _&ast;irip_, prefixed with _&ast;ta-_ SPONTANEOUS ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-7).4), are correct, then the form _&ast;ta-irip-i-_ ‘fan oneself’ is reconstructable to POc. However, this analysis presupposes an early Oceanic form _&ast;ta-iripV_ in order to account for the retention of Lou and Nyindrou _-p_, and it is not clear why there should have been a final vowel here.


<a id="p-465"></a>

The final consonants of PMP _&ast;irid_ and POc _&ast;irip_ do not match, but the Oceanic evidence supports only _&ast;irip_.[^3]

There are no known WOc reflexes of _&ast;irip_, which seems to have been replaced by PWOc _&ast;tapi_ (V) ‘fan’, reconstructed below.

[PWOc &ast;_tapi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-2-466-PWOc-tapi-a)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Seizing, grabbing, snatching, taking hold of


A good many Oceanic languages make a distinction between a verb meaning ‘take hold of’ and one meaning ‘hold’. POc verbs that evidently meant ‘hold’ are found in [§7.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-3-4#cldf:5-7). POc _&ast;lawe_ meant ‘take hold of’, whilst POc _&ast;paRo_ appears to have denoted seizing something violently.

[POc &ast;_lawe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-3-466-POc-lawe-a)


<a id="p-467"></a>

[POc &ast;_paqaRo(k)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-3-467-POc-paqarok-a)


<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Grasping, gripping, holding with hand


Four verbs in the semantic domain ‘hold in the hand’ are reconstructed below. They are POc _&ast;qabi_ ‘take hold of, grasp’, POc _&ast;tau(r)_/_&ast;taur-i-_ ‘hold (in hand)’, POc _&ast;poso_ ‘hold’, POc _&ast;gogo(m)_/_&ast;gom-i_ ‘hold in the fist’. It is difficult to assign more precise meanings to them, but the meaning ‘hold in the fist’ for POc _&ast;gogo(m)_ is strengthened by that of non-Oceanic cognates.

Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _&ast;qabi_ and POc _&ast;abi_, both ‘take hold of, grasp’, and POc _&ast;abit_ ‘hold, get, take’, reflecting PMP _&ast;ambit_ ‘seize with the hands’. On the assumption that the cognate set below reflects a single POc form, the data attest POc _&ast;qabi(t)_, _&ast;qabit-i-_. Root-final _&ast;-t_ is attested in the Lenakel forms.[^4] This suggests that the PMP reconstruction should be _&ast;qambit_.

[PMP &ast;_(q)ambit_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-4-467-POc-qabit-a)


<a id="p-468"></a>

PMP _&ast;cekep_ ‘seize, grasp’ has just one known Oceanic reflex:

[PMP &ast;_cekep_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-4-468-POc-sokop-a)

POc _&ast;tau(r)_, _&ast;taur-i-_ has well distributed reflexes and was perhaps the default POc term for ‘hold in the hand’.

[POc &ast;_tau(r)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-4-468-POc-taur-a)


<a id="p-469"></a>

POc _&ast;poso_ ‘hold’ has only two known reflexes, but given their exact correspondence and geographic distance from one another the term can be reconstructed to POc.

[POc &ast;_poso_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-3-4-469-POc-poso-a)

It is important to distinguish between POc _&ast;gogo(m)_/_&ast;gom-i_ ‘hold in the fist’ below and _&ast;gomu_ ‘hold in the mouth’, reconstructed in [§4.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-5#cldf:5-7).3.

## 4. Interpersonal actions


This section is concerned with acts that people perform on each other, again with the hands. Verbs of hitting are reconstructed in [vol.1:271](ContributionTable?anchor=p-271#cldf:1-9)–274. Not all of these are typically used of hitting a fellow human being, but one that is is reconstructed afresh in [§7.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4-1#cldf:5-7) in the light of a much expanded data base. A term that might have found its way into this section is ‘stroke’ (in the sense of running one’s hand over part of another’s body), but the only relevant POc reconstruction is _&ast;samo(s)_, _&ast;samos-i-_ ‘massage, stroke’, reconstructed in [§5.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4-2#cldf:5-7).2. Reconstructing a verb for ‘tickle’ raises a formal challenge that is discussed in [§7.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4-2#cldf:5-7).


<a id="p-470"></a>


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Slapping and clapping


A verb for slapping, POc _&ast;pʷasa(r,R)_, _&ast;pʷasa(r,R)-i-_ ‘slap, hit’, was reconstructed in [vol.1:273](ContributionTable?anchor=p-273#cldf:1-9). With considerably more data the form and gloss of the reconstruction can be edited as shown below.

<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Tickling


The collection of Oceanic items considered here is better described as a set of lookalikes than as a cognate set, as it includes instances where regular sound changes have simply not taken place and perhaps also instances where idiosyncratic changes have occurred. This appears to be the result of onomatopoeia, such that the overall shape of a word is retained but some phonological contrasts are unimportant. Clearly this was already the case in PMP, as Blust (ACD) reconstructs _&ast;kilik_, _&ast;kirik_, _&ast;kidi_, _&ast;gidik_ and _&ast;giri_, all ‘tickle’. The onomatopoeic template is clear: _&ast;KiRi(k)_, where _&ast;K_ is a velar stop, voiced or unvoiced, and _&ast;R_ is a voiced apical (PMP _&ast;l_, _&ast;r_ or _&ast;d_). These shapes survive remarkably well into Oceanic, despite the fact that PMP _&ast;k-_ and _&ast;g-_ regularly merge then split into POc _&ast;k-_ and _&ast;g-_ with a strong preference for POc _&ast;k-_, whilst PMP _&ast;-d-_ and _&ast;-r-_ normally merge as POc _&ast;-r-_. This implies that onomatopoeic terms for ‘tickle’ have not been affected by regular sound changes.

Partly as a means of simplifying presentation, I reconstruct POc forms below, but because regularity of sound change does not apply, there is no guarantee that a given item is directly descended from the reconstruction under which it is listed. It follows from this that there is also no guarantee that the reconstructions are correct, especially where there are fewer reflexes.

[PMP &ast;_kilik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-4-2-471-POc-kiliki-a)

[PMP &ast;_kirik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-4-2-471-POc-kiris-a)


<a id="p-472"></a>

The items listed under ‘cf. also’ immediately above may reflect either _&ast;kili(k)_ or _&ast;kiri(s)_.

The three putative POc forms above have reasonable support both from reflexes and from non-Oceanic cognates. But their root-final consonants are perhaps also significant. If the root-medial liquid is _&ast;-l-_, then the root-final consonant is _&ast;-k_, but if the root-medial liquid is _&ast;-r-_, then the root-final consonant is _&ast;-s_. This suggests two distinct early Oceanic templates, _&ast;Kilik_ and _&ast;Kiris_.

There is a variety of other Oceanic forms that conform to one of these templates but reflect the ‘wrong’ protoform. The items below are shown with in the fifth column the POc forms they reflect if regular sound changes are applied. All the latter display medial _&ast;-d(r)-_, but it seems somewhat unlikely that such protoforms ever occurred, as they would reflect PMP _&ast;Kindis_, for which there is no evidence. The hypothetical forms in the sixth column are the forms expected if regular sound changes had applied to the template _&ast;Kiris_. It is fairly obvious that Mussau _kiri_, Halia _giri-_ and Paamese _kir-kiris-i_ reflect the failure of a sound change to apply to the medial _&ast;-r-_. Dawawa _gidi_ perhaps reflects the formation of a new template _&ast;Kidi_, which was also the antecedent of Mwotlap _ɣin-ɣin_. Voiced stops normally occur in Gapapaiwa only in loans from nearby PT languages, but _gidi_ may reflect the presence of unusual sounds in an onomatopoeic item.

## 5. Foot and leg actions


A good many actions of the feet and legs are obviously verbs of locomotion like ‘walk’, ’step’, ‘run’, ‘crawl’, ‘limp’ and ‘hop’, for which reconstructions are presented in [§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:5-7), and ‘wade’ ([§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-7).2). Dancing is an activity with substantial cultural associations in Oceanic communities, and belongs in vol.6. This section was planned to deal with the remainder: kicking, stamping and treading on. However, no cognate sets with the narrow meaning ‘kick’ have been found. When someone deliberately kicks something or someone, this is often expressed with ‘hit with the foot’, and some reflexes of verbs for stamping and treading on sometimes have as one of their senses ‘kick with the sole of the foot’. Hence the reconstructions in this section both relate to stamping and treading on: POc _&ast;paRas_ (VI) ‘step, tread’, _&ast;paRas-i-_ (VT) ‘step on, tread on’ and PEOc _&ast;butu_ (VI) ‘stamp foot, tread, kick’, _&ast;butuR-i-_ ‘stamp on, tread on, trample’.

## 6. Bathing and washing


Like [§7.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-5#cldf:5-7), the present section presents reconstructions for verbs encoding concepts other than locomotion. Hence reconstructions for verbs of swimming, moving about under water, and floating are given in [§6.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-3#cldf:5-7). They include POc _&ast;tuRu(p)_ ‘wade’ and POc _&ast;kaRu_, POc _&ast;qasa_ and PEOc _&ast;olo_, all ‘swim’. The reconstructions in this section are actions involving water but not locomotion, and fall into two semantic sets: verbs denoting bathing, i.e. washing one’s body by immersion in water ([§7.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6-1#cldf:5-7)), and verbs denoting the washing of either part of the body or an object ([§7.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6-2#cldf:5-7)).

### 6.1. Bathing, immersing oneself


In traditional Oceanic societies the characteristic method of washing oneself all over is to immerse oneself in a river or, failing that, in the sea. On the basis of the glosses of their reflexes two reconstructions seem to have been terms primarily for washing oneself or someone else, typically a child, in this way. They are POc _&ast;siu-siu_ ‘wash oneself’/_&ast;siuw-i-_ ‘wash s.o’ and POc _&ast;ri-riu(s)_ ‘wash, bathe’/_&ast;rius-i-_ ‘wash s.o., bathe s.o.’ There is a note in Hutchisson’s Sursurunga dictionary file that _siwi_, the reflex of _&ast;siuw-i-_, is a generic term for washing, and this was evidently true of the POc form too.

The transitional consonant _&ast;-w-_ in _&ast;siuw-i-_ reflects a minor reconstructive challenge. PMP _&ast;ziuq_ shows final _&ast;-q_, but there is no reflex thereof in Oceanic reflexes. Instead, Oceanic reflexes point to _&ast;-p_. However, I infer that pre-POc _&ast;siu-i_ acquired a transitional [w] which was strengthened to Tolai and PEOc bilabial fricative _&ast;-v-_.

POc _&ast;ri-riu(s)_/_&ast;rius-i-_ apparently reflects PAn/PMP _&ast;diRus_ ‘bathe’, but with irregular loss of medial _&ast;-R-_. Only in Wayan Fijian would this loss be irregular.

[PAn/PMP &ast;_diRus_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-6-1-476-POc-ririus-a)

POc _&ast;su-su(p)_, _&ast;sup-i-_ below is phonologically very similar to _&ast;siu-siu_, _&ast;siuw-i-_ above, and it is tempting to assume that the disyllabic root _&ast;siu_ [&ast;siju] has been reduced from disyllable to monosyllabic _&ast;[sju]_, then, because the latter conflicts with Oceanic phonotactics, to &ast;[suː]. This might have resulted in alternant forms in POc or have happened on various occasions post-POC. However, there is reason to think that this inference is wrong. Reflexes of _&ast;siu-siu_, _&ast;siuw-i-_ all have to do with washing. Reflexes of _&ast;su-su(p)_, _&ast;sup-i-_ point to a semantic element of submersion and diving as well as of washing. Moreover, Gela has contrasting reflexes of _&ast;siuv-i-_ and _&ast;sup-i-_.

<a id="p-477"></a>

POc _&ast;sugu(p)_, _&ast;sugup-i-_ below appears to have been identical in meaning with POc _&ast;su-su(p)_, _&ast;sup-i-_ immediately above. If there is a historical connection between them, however, it is difficult to see what it is. Neither has known non-Oceanic cognates, and one can only speculate that two POc dialects perhaps borrowed cognate terms from neighbouring Papuan languages. The Tongan and Niuean reflexes below reflect PPn _&ast;uku_ rather than expected _&ast;huku_ (which Tongan and Niuean would reflect as _huku_).

<a id="p-479"></a>

The forms in initial _ñ-_ and _n-_ listed below under POc _&ast;ñu-ñu(p)_/_&ast;ñup-i-_, _&ast;ñugu-i-_ and _&ast;ñulu-i-_ presented a reconstructive problem, as the non-initial consonants do not correspond. The transitive verbs below are each followed by a parenthesised protoform from which they could be descended. At first sight, these appear chaotic, but two sets of facts conspire to provide a solution. The first is that an initial _&ast;ñ-_ on a verb sometimes reflects the application of the PMP actor-voice formative _&ast;[pa]N-_ ([vol.1:29](ContributionTable?anchor=p-29#cldf:1-2)–30) to a root with initial _&ast;s-_. The second is that the non-initial consonants are identical to those found in _&ast;s_-initial forms with the same meanings, including _&ast;sup-i-_ and _&ast;sugu-i-_ reconstructed above. The hypothesis that emerges is that the transitive forms in _&ast;ñ-_ reflect application of _&ast;[pa]N-_ to _&ast;s_-initial roots. It is difficult to be certain how the fragmentary survivals from the PMP system worked in POc, but it is reasonable to infer that, for example, _&ast;ñu-ñu(p)_ was the actor-voice intransitive form, _&ast;sup-i-_ the transitive (see the discussion of intransitive and transitive forms of the verb ‘eat’ in [§4.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-1#cldf:5-7).1). This implies that reduplicated intransitive forms like E Kara _su-suf_ and Vurës _suv-suv_, listed above under POc _&ast;su-su(p)_/_&ast;sup-i-_, were back formations created from transitive _&ast;sup-i-_ corresponding intransitives, by applying the POc pattern noted in [vol.1:25](ContributionTable?anchor=p-25#cldf:1-2) (see also [Evans 2003](Source#cldf:Evans2003):81–84). Similarly, transitives like Seimat _nuh-i_ and Baluan _nup_ reflect the converse application of this pattern to intransitive _&ast;ñu-ñu(p)_. The fact that two POc verb pairs, _&ast;su-su(p)_/_&ast;sup-i-_ and _&ast;ñu-ñu(p)_/_&ast;ñup-i-_ can be reconstructed suggests that these processes occurred at some pre-POc stage.

[POc &ast;_ñugup-i-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-6-1-479-POc-nugupi-a)

The third of these sets, supporting the reconstruction of _&ast;ñulu-i-_, does not correspond to a form in _&ast;s-_ reconstructed above. Instead we find three Admiralties forms reflecting _&ast;ñ-_ and three New Ireland (MM) forms reflecting _&ast;s-_ which together allow us to reconstruct two POc transitive forms, _&ast;ñulu-i-_ and _&ast;sulu-i-_ ‘wash s.o.’.

<a id="p-480"></a>

POc _&ast;su-su(p)_/_&ast;sup-i-_ and POc _&ast;sugu(p)_/_&ast;sugup-i-_, both reconstructed above, denoted bathing but also had a more specialised sense of swimming. The gloss of the Nakanai reflex of POc _&ast;lo-loso(p)_ suggests by contrast that it denoted bathing with a more specialised sense of swimming, perhaps under the surface. In a number of Vanuatu languages the main sense is now ‘swim’.

There is a small doubt about the formal reconstruction of POc _&ast;kʷaya_, as NNG languages have initial _w-_, most non-NNG languages _k-_. However, the latter are fortis reflexes (rather than lenis _ɣ-_ or _ʔ-_), and thus plausible reflexes of _&ast;kʷ-_.

### 6.2. Washing and cleaning


In contrast to the terms reconstructed in [§7.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-6-2#cldf:5-7), the terms presented in this section denote washing one’s hands or face and sometimes washing objects. When they denote washing objects, it is fairly common to find reflexes with glosses that also mention rubbing something to get it clean, suggesting that their central meaning is one of cleaning in general, not just of washing.

Various scholars have suggested that the particular reflex of POc _&ast;wasi-_ known to them (e.g. [Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)) is borrowed from English wash via the local pidgin. However, the collection of reflexes below suggests that a POc term is reconstructable, and that the resemblance between its reflexes and, e.g., Vanuatu Bislama wasem is a matter of chance.

[POc &ast;_wasi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-6-2-481-POc-wasi-a)


<a id="p-482"></a>

The fact that POc _&ast;pulu_, _&ast;puRiq_ and _&ast;puqi_ below all begin with _&ast;pu-_ appears to be a matter of chance, but has on occasion led to the attribution of an item to the wrong cognate set.[^5]

[POc &ast;_puqi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-6-2-483-POc-puqi-a)

The presence of _-u_ for †_-o_ in the Mangseng and Hoava reflexes below may indicate that they reflect a protoform other than POc _&ast;paño_. Nonetheless, the presence of non-Oceanic cognates and the Polynesian reflexes means that Blust is right to reconstruct in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995).

The two terms below display skewed geographic distributions of reflexes, but both meet the criteria for POc reconstruction.

## 7. Verbs with a location component


The verbs reconstructed below, translated as ‘hide’ and ‘wait’, each have a semantic component of location, but not of posture.


<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. Wait


One waits somewhere for something to happen. Semantically the verb has both a locational component (being somewhere) and a cognitive component (expecting an event). Just one POc verb is reconstructed with this sense.

[POc &ast;_tari_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-7-1-484-POc-tari-a)


<a id="p-485"></a>

Motu (PT) _nari_ (VI) ‘wait’, may be the sole reflex of a POc morphological intransitive _&ast;nari_ (reflecting _&ast;[pa]N-_ + _&ast;tari_) ([§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-7).6).


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. Hiding


Oceanic languages preserve reflexes of three POc forms descended from PMP _&ast;buni_ ‘hide, conceal’. Two of these are _&ast;puni_ and _&ast;muni_. Their origin, briefly mentioned in [§1.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-5#cldf:5-7).5, is transparent. POc _&ast;puni_ was the root form, reflecting PMP _&ast;buni_, and was originally transitive. POc _&ast;muni_ reflected PMP _&ast;m-uni_, the outcome of adding the actor-voice infix _&ast;⟨um⟩_ to the root _&ast;puni_, to form an intransitive, involving a morphophonemic rule whereby _&ast;⟨um⟩_ + _&ast;p-_ became _&ast;m-_. Probably this transitive/intransitive contrast was maintained in POc, as it survives in Siar (MM) _mumun_ (VI) vs _wun_ (VT) ([Frowein 2011](Source#cldf:Frowein2011):94), but, as the cognate sets below show, various languages have created an intransitive from _&ast;puni_ and a transitive from _&ast;muni_, with or without a derivational morpheme.

[PMP &ast;_m-uni_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-7-7-2-486-POc-muni-a)


<a id="p-487"></a>

The third POc form descended from PMP _&ast;buni_ ‘hide, conceal’ is POc _&ast;buni_. This is almost certainly not a direct descendant of PMP _&ast;buni_, as POc _&ast;puni_ has that privilege. Instead, it appears from the glosses of its reflexes to be an alternant to _&ast;muni_, i.e. an intransitive. The best hypothesis to account for it is that it arose at a pre-POc stage when marking intransitive with _&ast;⟨um⟩_ was at least still partially productive, but instead of _&ast;m_ replacing _&ast;p-_ (the effective outcome of the rule mentioned above), it was added to it to form pre-POc _&ast;mpuni_, which by regular sound change became _&ast;buni_.

## Notes

[^1]: From PMP _&ast;hasek_ ‘dibble, plant seeds with a dibble stick’ (ACD).

[^2]: POc _&ast;ta-_ formed undergoer-subject verbs, but this is not the function of the prefix here.

[^3]: Final PMP _&ast;-d_ is not reflected in all wMP languages. Blust (ACD) cites Balinese _ilih_ ‘kind of fan; to fan’, where _-h_ reflects _&ast;-q_, not _&ast;-d_ or _&ast;-p_.

[^4]: John Lynch kindly drew our attention to these forms and their significance.

[^5]: Tolo _vuli-_ ‘wash (hands, clothes)’ was attributed to POc _&ast;pulu_ in [vol.1:243](ContributionTable?anchor=p-243#cldf:1-9), instead of to _&ast;puRiq_. # FIXME: erratum in vol1

[^6]: John Lynch points out that Naman _tərav_, Uripiv _e-triv_, Tirax _trɛv_, Nisvai _tarv-i_ appear to reflect _&ast;tarav_, while Neve’ei _terax-en_, Big Nambas, Tape _tərax_ reflect _&ast;tarak_. These forms are all from Malakula, and we can offer no account of them.

## 1. Introduction


This chapter collects together terms that people use to describe each other and to express their own feelings. It includes terms used to describe

- a person’s physical qualities ([§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:5-11)): tall vs short, big vs small, fat vs thin and strong vs
 weak ;
- a person’s temperament ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:5-11)): tame vs untamed, brave vs cowardly, obstinate, ignorant
 vs wise and stupid vs intelligent;
- a person’s emotions ([§11.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4#cldf:5-11)): afraid, ashamed, compassionate, happy, sad, angry, confused,
 surprised;
- wanting ([§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:5-11));
- one’s evaluation of someone or something as good or bad ([§11.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6#cldf:5-11)).

This is quite a mixed bag, both semantically and formally. Terms of temperament, emotion and wanting normally describe only human beings and sometimes higher animals, but terms used to describe physical qualities or to express an evaluation are applied to a wider range of referents that includes inanimates. Terms of temperament, emotion and wanting are quite often BPMs, as they denote human affective states. The range of meanings found in the headings in this chapter is somewhat restricted. For example, we tried to reconstruct terms for ‘lazy’ vs ‘hard-working’ and ‘generous’ vs ‘mean’, but could not do so because cognate sets are at best very local. One reason for this is certainly that speakers are creative in their use of metaphor, and so one term or metaphor is easily replaced by another. An associated reason is that many of our sources do not record the complex lexemes that result from metaphorical usage. Although BPMs occur for various aspects of wanting and desire, none are recorded in [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:5-11) because there is little conceptual similarity among languages.

Among the semantic fields in which BPMs are used, fewer are found in the description of temperament than in the labelling of emotions. The reason for this is almost certainly that temperament, like body shape ([§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:5-11)), is fairly stable through adulthood, and stable qualities tend to be labelled by single words. Emotions and desires, on the other hand, are essentially changeable, and are often described metaphorically. The boundary between temperament terms and emotion terms, however, is fuzzy. Saying that someone is brave may refer to someone’s temperament or to their current behaviour. In the latter case a BPM is expected, so that a BPM like POc &ast;qate- (p,pʷ)atu(k) [liver- strong/firm] ‘brave’ ([§11.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3-2#cldf:5-11).1) was basically an expression used of someone’s immediate behaviour that was also extended to a stable propensity of temperament.

## 2. Properties of the human body



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Stature: tall vs short


Languages vary as to whether or not they lexicalise a distinction between horizontal and vertical length. English does so by distinguishing between horizontal long and vertical tall, but the antonym of both terms is short. German and French equate vertical length, at least in its application to human beings, with size: German groβ, French grand ‘big, tall’ vs German klein, French petit ‘small, short in stature’.

Oceanic languages mostly agree in making no distinction between horizontal and vertical length. The term for ‘long’ also means ‘tall’ and the term for ‘short’ has both horizontal and vertical application. Both apply to the stature of human beings. The relevant terms are reconstructed in [vol.2(197](ContributionTable?anchor=p-197#cldf:2-7)–199). In no Oceanic language for which data are available is human stature equated with size ([§11.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2-2#cldf:5-11)).


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Size: big vs small


It follows from the last statement that terms with the general meaning ‘big’ (POc _&ast;lapuat_) and ‘small’ (POc _&ast;qitik_, _&ast;riki(t,q)_), reconstructed in [vol.2(191](ContributionTable?anchor=p-191#cldf:2-6)–196), do not denote stature when they refer to human beings. To assert that someone is ‘big’ is typically to say that this person has social prestige, and this was probably also true in POc. The nature of that prestige depends on community structure. In chiefly societies, a ‘big’ man is a chieftain.

[POc &ast;_lapuat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-2-568-POc-lapuat-a)

In non-chiefly societies a ‘big’ man is an important person, perhaps by virtue of leadership qualities, perhaps by virtue of accrued wealth.

[5-11-2-2-568-adm-titan-manrean](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-2-2-568-adm-titan-manrean)


<a id="p-569"></a>

A secondary but much less frequent association of ‘big’ is with age: ‘big’ equates with ‘older’.

‘Small’ in Oceanic languages is the antonym of ‘big’ with regard to size, but not in its extended meanings. The expected antonym of ‘chiefly, important’ would be ‘socially inferior’, but this usage appears to be very rare. Instead, ‘small’ seems far more frequently used of a child, that is, with regard to age. However, it is difficult to be sure about this, because a gloss like ‘young, small’ does not tell us that the word is used for small objects in general, as the translator may simply have ‘young child, small child’ in mind.


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Girth: fat vs thin


Oceanic languages typically distinguish between (a) the girth (circumferential thickness) of both human beings (English _fat_ or _stout_) and non-human objects (e.g. _a thick stem_) and (b) the thickness of something with a flat surface, like paper, or the depth of a large body of water.

Two terms reconstructed for ‘thick’ in [vol.2(201](ContributionTable?anchor=p-201#cldf:2-7)–202) concern us here, POc _&ast;ma-tolu_ and POc _&ast;[tubu]tubu[ka]_. Glosses that disambiguate the meaning of _&ast;ma-tolu_ point in just one instance (Manam) to girth and in a majority of cases to the thickness of something flat, and it is reasonable to infer that this was its central POc sense.

[POc &ast;_ma-tolu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-3-569-POc-matolu-a)


<a id="p-570"></a>

The POc term for a large girth was _&ast;[tubu]tubu[ka]_, reconstructed in [vol.2:202](ContributionTable?anchor=p-202#cldf:2-7).[^1] Additional reflexes have been found, and we give the cognate set as it now stands.

[POc &ast;_&#91;tubu&#93;tubu&#91;ka&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-3-570-POc-tubutubuka-a)

The term reconstructed for ‘thin’ in [vol.2(202](ContributionTable?anchor=p-202#cldf:2-7)–203) is POc _&ast;manipis_. Below are listed reflexes with disambiguating glosses, and it is clear that _&ast;manipis_ is the antonym of _&ast;matolu_ ‘thick (of flat objects)’ and thus not a term applied to human beings.

[PAn &ast;_&#91;ma&#93;Lipis_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-3-570-POc-manipis-a)

The data make it clear that Oceanic languages have a distinct term or terms for people who are thin/scawny/skinny, but no cognate set reflecting a POc term with this meaning has been reconstructed. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs a PNCV term that evidently had this sense.

[PNCV &ast;_magura_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-3-570-PNCV-magura-a)


<a id="p-571"></a>


<a id="s-2-4"></a>

### 2.4. Strength: strong vs weak


Oceanic terms for ‘strong’ tend also to mean ‘hard’. One POc term for ‘strong, hard’ was _&ast;toRas_, reconstructed in [vol.3(200](ContributionTable?anchor=p-200#cldf:3-7)–201) with the sense ‘a taxon of hardwood trees including _Intsia bijuga_’, where it is also noted that the POc term meant ‘hard, durable’. There is no evidence, though, that this term denoted human strength.

The three terms below, POc _&ast;kayu-kayu_, PROc _&ast;[kayu]kayu-a_ and PEOc _&ast;kaila_ ‘strong, firm’ appear to be derived from the generic term for tree, POc _&ast;kayu_ ([vol.3:71](ContributionTable?anchor=p-71#cldf:3-3)–73), used metaphorically for strength and hardness. However, this seemingly obvious derivation is a little problematic. If the reflexes of these three terms are compared with the terms for tree in the same languages, differences emerge. The _&ast;kayu_-like terms for ‘strong, firm’ have a fortis initial _k-_, whilst in languages that have a fortis/lenis distinction[^2] the term for ‘tree’ has a lenis initial _ɣ-_ (Bugotu, W Guadalcanal, Woleaian) or zero (Labu, Paamese). This appears to be evidence against the hypothesis that these terms are derived from _&ast;kayu_. However, the history of the fortis/lenis distinction is not well understood, and in favour of the hypothesis is that POc _&ast;kayu-kayu_ and _&ast;[kayu]kayu-a_ were both formed from _&ast;kayu_ by two early Oceanic adjective-forming strategies. The first was CVCV- reduplication, giving POc _&ast;kayu-kayu_ ‘strong, tough, inflexible’ ([vol.2:206](ContributionTable?anchor=p-206#cldf:2-7)–220). The second was the addition of _&ast;-[k]a_ to a noun ([Ross 2000](Source#cldf:Ross2000)), giving _&ast;[kayu]kayu-a_. The fortis/lenis and other formal discrepancies can perhaps be explained by assuming that speakers’ association of ‘strong, firm’ with ‘tree’ was lost in some languages, and as a result the root of the ‘strong’ term and the reflex of _&ast;kayu_ have undergone different phonological developments.

PEOc _&ast;kaila_ ‘strong, firm’ has a similar set of meanings, and was presumably also derived from _&ast;kayu_, but the derivational mechanism has not been recorded in other terms.

[POc &ast;_kayu-kayu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-4-571-POc-kayukayu-a)


<a id="p-572"></a>

[PROc &ast;_&#91;kayu&#93;kayu-a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-4-572-PROc-kayukayua-a)

It is possible that Seimat [Adm] _aila-n_ in the BPM _patu ailan_ ‘he is obstinate’ means ‘hard, strong’. If so, then PEOc _&ast;kaila_ is elevated to POc status.

[PEOc &ast;_kaila_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-4-572-PEOc-kaila-a)

A further term for ‘hard, strong, firm’ is POc _&ast;[(p,pʷ)atu](p,pʷ)atu_ ‘hard, strong, firm’, again an adjective formed by reduplication of a noun. The noun was &ast;(p,pʷ)atu ‘outer shell, skull’ (Ch:- bodyparts, [§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-11)).

[POc &ast;_&#91;(p,pʷ)atu&#93;(p,pʷ)atu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-4-572-POc-ppatuppatu-a)

Two terms with an implication of human strength, both reconstructed by Blust (ACD), are recorded in [vol.2(214](ContributionTable?anchor=p-214#cldf:2-7)): POc _&ast;paka(s)_ ‘have energy, strength’ and POc _&ast;laga(s)_ ‘spirited, energetic’.


<a id="p-573"></a>

Weak has at least two related senses in English when it is applied to human beings: ‘temporarily weak as a result of tiredness, sickness or hunger’ and ‘constitutionally weak’. It is the latter which relevant here. Just as ‘strong’ is associated with ‘hard’ in Oceanic languages, so ‘weak’ is associated with ’soft’. POc _&ast;[ma]lumu_ ‘soft, gentle, easy’ is reconstructed in [vol.2(215](ContributionTable?anchor=p-215#cldf:2-7)). In its application to people, this term seems to have had two senses: with reference to the body, ‘constitutionally weak’, and with reference to temperament ‘gentle, easygoing’ ([§11.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3-1#cldf:5-11).1). In the listing below ‘weak’ is shown in bold when it occurs in a gloss.

[PMP &ast;_&#91;ma&#93;lumu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-2-4-573-POc-malumu-a)

## 3. Properties of the human temperament


Whilst Oceanic languages certainly have terms, some of them BPMs, for human propensities, many of these terms may refer to both temporary and permanent states. It is the permanent states that are properties of temperament, and some languages have a construction that encodes these. There is, however, no POc construction that can be reconstructed with this function.

Iduna, like a number of other Papuan Tip languages, makes copious use of _to-_ ‘person who…’ (from POc _&ast;tau-_; [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-11).2) in expressions like the following, where the item compounded with _to-_, typically a verb, encodes a quality construed as permanent.

[5-11-3-None-573-pt-iduna-toselakalaka](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-573-pt-iduna-toselakalaka)


<a id="p-574"></a>

In a number of these compounds the stem is itself a BPM formed with nua ‘think; mind’.

[5-11-3-None-574-pt-iduna-tonuadoa](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-574-pt-iduna-tonuadoa)

Motu (PT) forms compound lexemes in a semantically parallel manner, but the attribute precedes _tau-na_, composed of _tau_ ‘person’ and _-na_ ‘its’. The attribute takes the prefix _he-_, indicating a state, condition or habit. _he-abidae tau-na_ ‘a hospitable man’ (_he-abidae_ ‘show hospitality’)

[5-11-3-None-574-pt-motu-heaitauna](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-574-pt-motu-heaitauna)

Although constructions reflecting POc _&ast;tau-_ ‘person who’ are widespread among Papuan Tip languages, there is little evidence that the construction was used for properties of temperament in POc. Instead, as noted in [§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:5-11).2, the POc construction was used to denote people with skill in a particular occupation and sometimes people of a certain place or clan. A check of reflexes in Mussau (Adm), Nakanai and Teop (MM), Woleaian and Carolinian (Mic) and various Polynesian languages suggests that the extension of the construction to denote temperamental qualities was restricted to PT.

Several languages have a noun that is used with the sense ‘disposition, way of acting, habit’ and is modified by an adjective or stative verb to form a complex lexeme denoting a property of temperament.

Seimat (Adm) has such a term, _oŋa_ ‘temperament or disposition’.

[5-11-3-None-574-adm-seimat-oasolian](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-574-adm-seimat-oasolian)

Tongan _aŋa_ reflects the PPn term _&ast;aŋa_ with widespread reflexes outside eastern Polynesia that are used in this way. Its resemblance to Seimat _oŋa_ may be a matter of chance. Tongan in particular has hundreds of complex lexemes formed with _aŋa_ ‘character, habit, nature’. A brief selection is given:


<a id="p-575"></a>

[5-11-3-None-575-pn-tongan-aamalu](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-575-pn-tongan-aamalu)

[PPn &ast;_aŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-575-PPn-aa-a)

In Tongan _aŋa_ stands in contrast with _loto_ ‘insides’ (< PPn _&ast;loto_; [vol.2:239](ContributionTable?anchor=p-239#cldf:2-8)). Where _aŋa_ denotes a permanent feature of temperament, e.g. _aŋa fiemālie_ ‘of contented and easy-going disposition’, loto denotes a transient emotion, e.g. _loto fiemālie_ ‘contented, satisfied’.

In Wayan Fijian _alo-_ ‘soul’ is similarly used for temperamental features as shown in the following examples, whilst the corresponding transient emotions are denoted by simple adjectives.

[5-11-3-None-575-fij-wayan-alokasa](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-None-575-fij-wayan-alokasa)

Similar expressions occur in Bauan Fijian with the cognate term _yalo-_ ‘soul, spirit, disposition’, e.g. _yalo mālua_ ‘meek, lowly’ (_mālua_ ‘quiet, gentle’), _yalo vinaka_ ‘kind-hearted’ (_vinaka_ ‘good’).

The examples collected from Iduna, Motu, Seimat, Fijian and Tongan show how each of these languages has devised a way to describe temperamental qualities, using a modifier with either a term like Tongan _aŋa_ ‘character, habit, nature’ or a reflex of the POc construction with _&ast;tau…_ ‘person who’.

Modifiers that describe features of temperament are reconstructed in the sections below, but this appears to be an unstable semantic field, presumably because of the tendency to invent new metaphors to describe behaviour and temperament. As a result, few terms are reconstructable.

<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Tame vs untamed



<a id="s-3-1-1"></a>

#### 3.1.1. Tame, accustomed to


POc evidently inherited a pair of terms meaning ‘tame, docile, trained, well behaved’ that were applied both to animals and human beings. The pair were _&ast;laca(m)_ and _&ast;ma-naca(m)_. Pairs of property terms with the same root were apparently quite common in POc, one unprefixed, the other with either _&ast;ka-_ or _&ast;ma-_, prefixes that often occur on stative verbs, both originating in the stative prefix _&ast;ka-_ ([Zeitoun & Huang 2000](Source#cldf:ZeitounandHuang2000):298). The seeming oddity about this pair is that the POc bare root had initial _&ast;l-_. the prefixed root initial _&ast;n-_. However, this is readily accounted for if the PAn root had initial _&ast;L-_,[^4] which regularly became PMP _&ast;l-_ initially but _&ast;-n-_ medially. Thus PAn _&ast;Lajam_ became PMP _&ast;lajam_ and POc _&ast;laca(m)_, whilst PAn _&ast;ma-Lajam_ regularly became PMP _&ast;ma-najam_ and POc _&ast;ma-naca(m)_.

[PAn &ast;_Lajam_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-1-576-POc-lacam-a)

POc _&ast;ma-naca(m)_ underwent an extension in meaning whereby ‘trained’ became ‘knowledgeable’ and then ‘know, understand, think about’, and as a nominal ‘knowledge, understanding, mind’. This extension is discussed in [§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-11). Reflexes below are restricted to the ‘tame’ etc senses.

[PAn &ast;_ma-Lajam_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-1-576-POc-manacam-a)


<a id="p-577"></a>

It is tempting to try to relate the items below to _&ast;ma-nacam_ above, but they evidently reflect a different (PWOc) etymon.

[PWOc &ast;_ma-napas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-1-577-PWOc-manapas-a)

It is reasonably clear from the glosses of the sets above that these terms referred to a temperamental quality for which there is no single English term. It describes a person who is domesticated, gentle and quietly spoken, and content with their lot. This quality was apparently positively valued. If it were otherwise, the glosses would almost certainly register the negativity.

POc _&ast;[ma]lumu_ ‘soft (of objects); gentle, easygoing; (constitutionally) weak’, reconstructed in [vol.2(215](ContributionTable?anchor=p-215#cldf:2-7)) as a property of inanimate objects, is applied in various Oceanic languages to the human temperament with a sense resembling that of the items above, and this extension may well have occurred in POc. It was evidently also applied to the body in the sense of ‘constitutionally weak’, and the cognate set is listed in [§11.2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2-4#cldf:5-11).

There is also evidence of a BPM containing this term.

[5-11-3-1-577-ses-arosi-ahumarumua](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-1-577-ses-arosi-ahumarumua)

In NCV, at least, the POc weather term &ast;ma-drapu ‘still, calm, windless’ ([vol.2:136](ContributionTable?anchor=p-136#cldf:2-5)) also has human application.

<a id="p-578"></a>


<a id="s-3-1-2"></a>

#### 3.1.2. Untamed, wild


As POc reconstructions for ‘tame, accustomed to’ refer to a kind of domesticated amiability, so terms glossed ‘wild’ similarly refer to the behaviour often associated with undomesticated animals, i.e. ‘savage’, ‘fierce’. In places, terms may also be applied to the rainforest and to normally cultivated plants that have self-sown outside the gardens. While terms for ‘tame’ are also used to denote a human temperamental quality, it is less clear that this is true of POc _&ast;wasi_.

[POc &ast;_wasi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-1-578-POc-wasi-a)


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Brave vs cowardly



<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Brave, courageous


Bravery is commonly expressed as a body-part metaphor (BPM) based on the liver or belly, with a modifying term apparently reflecting POc _&ast;[(p,pʷ)atu](p,pʷ)atu_ ‘hard, strong, firm’, the latter derived from _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’ ([§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-11)). Hence we can tentatively reconstruct a POc BPM _&ast;qate- (p,pʷ)atu_ [liver- hard/strong] ‘brave’. In the languages of the set below, reflexes of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_ also function as a stative verb ‘firm, strong’. Reflexes of _(p,pʷ)atu_ are formally and semantically similar to _&ast;patu_ ‘stone’ ([vol.2:62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:2-3)), but in POc were distinct from it ([§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-11).1). In Kwaio, however, which does not have a reflex of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_, the fou of lae-fou ‘brave’ is the term for ‘stone’. One may infer that the Kwaio term is a reflex of _&ast;qate- (p,pʷ)atu_ which with the loss of a reflex of _&ast;(p,pʷ)atu_ has been reinterpreted as if it reflected _&ast;qate- patu_ [liver- stone]. Something similar has occurred in Gumawana and Iduna, where the modifying term taken alone has a meaning other than ‘firm, strong’.


<a id="p-579"></a>

Why not infer that _&ast;patu_ ‘stone’ occurred in the POc term and that all BPMs below reflect _&ast;qate- patu_? Because POc _&ast;patu_ ‘stone’ would be reflected as Gumawana †_vatu_, Dobu †_atu_, Bunama †_hatu_, but these terms do not occur at all (Gela _vatu_ ‘stone’ does occur). The morpheme _patu_ in their BPMs thus probably reflects _(p,pʷ)atu_ (cf. Dobu _patu_ (VI) ‘harden, set’).

[POc &ast;_qate-(p,pʷ)atu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-2-579-POc-qateppatu-a)

A construal of bravery as strength or hardness — the two are typically encoded by a single lexical item in languages of Melanesia — of the seat of the emotions is widespread.

[5-11-3-2-579-nng-takia-ilodabai](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-2-579-nng-takia-ilodabai)


<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Cowardly, timid


Relatively few Oceanic dictionaries have an entry for ‘cowardly’. Terms found tend to reflect _&ast;matakut_ ‘fear’ ([§11.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-1#cldf:5-11)), as the examples below suggest.

[5-11-3-2-579-pt-dobu-matamatauta](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-2-579-pt-dobu-matamatauta)


<a id="p-580"></a>

We have three reflexes of the BPM _&ast;qate- lapuat_ [liver big]. Oddly, this metaphor has the reverse meaning of that proposed by Blust for PMP where [big liver] stands for ‘brave, proud, arrogant’ (see [§9.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-6#cldf:5-11)).

[5-11-3-2-580-ncv-mota-varalava](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-2-580-ncv-mota-varalava)

Marshallese has eccelok acin [without liver] ‘he is not brave’.


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Obstinate, stubborn


A rather widespread BPM for ‘obstinate, stubborn’ has a modifier of the same meaning as the BPM for ‘brave, courageous’ ([§11.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3-2#cldf:5-11).1) namely ‘strong/firm’, but a different body-part. POc _&ast;qate-_ ‘liver’ was evidently used in the BPM for ‘brave’. The evidence of Admiralties and NCV languages below suggests that _&ast;qate-_ was replaced by _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ ([§3.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4-2#cldf:5-11)) in the BPM for ‘obstinate’. This may be a further illustration of the hypothesis that more physically expressed qualities such as ‘brave’ form a BPM with _&ast;qate-_, while mental states do not ([§9.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-4#cldf:5-11)). Instead of _&ast;lalo-_, however, in this case the more specific _&ast;bʷatu(k)_ occurs. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs a BPM here, PNCV _&ast;bʷatu kayua_ [head strong] ‘wilful, stubborn’, reflected by the Big Nambas and Paamese terms below.

[5-11-3-3-580-adm-seimat-patuailan](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-3-580-adm-seimat-patuailan)

Another BPM with scattered WOc occurrences is ‘ear blocked’.

#### 3.4.1. Ignorant, stupid


In Eastern Oceanic languages ignorance is sometimes expressed by a BPM [mind dark], a complex lexeme that also means ‘forget’ in some EOc languages ([§10.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-6#cldf:5-11)). In some languages this BPM has both senses. Again, the terms for ‘night’ reflect either POc &ast;rodrom ‘be dark, be night’ or POc _&ast;boŋi_ ‘night’ ([vol.2:295](ContributionTable?anchor=p-295#cldf:2-9)–298).

[5-11-3-4-581-ses-lau-liororodoa](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-4-581-ses-lau-liororodoa)

Sometimes a verb ‘be dark’ is used alone as a metaphor for ‘ignorant’.

[5-11-3-4-581-ses-toabaita-rorodoa](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-4-581-ses-toabaita-rorodoa)

Oceanic languages tend to have a term which means ‘mentally impaired’ and translates, depending on context, as ‘ignorant’, ‘stupid’, ‘foolish, silly’ or ‘mad, crazy, insane’. They reflect a number of POc terms which must have different shades of meaning that are now lost to us.

POc _&ast;kila_ has only one Oceanic reflex, and it is a reasonable inference that it disappeared early across much of Oceanic because the merger of PMP _&ast;g_ and _&ast;k_ rendered Oceanic reflexes similar to those of POc (VI) _&ast;kilala_ ‘know’, from PMP _&ast;kilala_, with the opposite meaning.

[PMP &ast;_gila_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-3-4-581-POc-kila-a)

The presence of reflexes of POc _&ast;[ŋa(q)u]ŋa(q)uŋ_ ‘stupid, ignorant’ in an Admiralties language and a few NNG languages warrants its reconstruction. Possible medial _&ast;-q-_ is shown, as it allows the reconstructed form to accord with POc canonic structure, and would have been lost in each of these reflexes.

<a id="p-582"></a>

The presence of medial _&ast;-p-_ in POc _&ast;bʷa(p)u_ below is unambiguously supported only by Iamalele _-v-_, and is contradicted by the absence of _-v-_ in Longgu. In the other witnesses _&ast;-p-_ becomes zero in this context.

#### 3.4.2. Wise, intelligent


Despite the fact that Oceanic languages typically have a term meaning ‘intelligent, clever, wise, understanding’, it has proven impossible to reconstruct a corresponding POc term.

Occasionally a BPM [mind daylight] occurs, the antonym of [mind night] ‘ignorant’ ([§11.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3-4#cldf:5-11)), and it is possible that there was a PNCV BPM of the form _&ast;lolo- marani_ [insides daylight] ‘clever, intelligent’ (reflecting POc _&ast;ma-raqani_ ‘be(come) light’, [vol.2:318](ContributionTable?anchor=p-318#cldf:2-9)–219).

[5-11-3-4-583-nng-poeng-lomatana](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-4-583-nng-poeng-lomatana)

The term for ‘wise, knowledgeable’ is often derived from the verb ‘know’ ([§10.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-2#cldf:5-11)).

[5-11-3-4-583-pt-dobu-sinasinapu](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-3-4-583-pt-dobu-sinasinapu)

Only for PPn has a form been reconstructed.

## 4. Emotion expressions


As discussed in chapter 9, emotions are typically described as emanating either from the liver (POc _&ast;qate_), as seat of emotions and thoughts, or from a quasi-body part, POc _&ast;lalo-_, _&ast;lalom_ ‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’, but other body parts sometimes occur in their place. Particular feelings are expressed as a BPM that specifies the nature of the feeling.

Although a degree of common conceptual patterns can be identified in BPMs for broadly identified emotions like happiness, sadness and anger, no reconstructions are made.

Languages closer to New Guinea seem to make the greatest use of BPMs for emotions, and languages further east use them less, petering out almost entirely in Polynesia, where the body-part component of the BPM tends to be lost and the modifying component tends to become an adjective in its own right ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:5-11), [§3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5#cldf:5-11), [§3.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-8#cldf:5-11)).


<a id="p-584"></a>

A small number of broadly identified emotion terms have been reconstructed as single lexemes, and we turn to these first.


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Afraid


Although a language will typically use numerous metaphors to describe different degrees or kinds of fear, languages from all major subgroups have reflexes of POc _&ast;matakut_, probably indicating that it was the term most general in meaning. Both an intransitive and a transitive form are reconstructable. The intransitive form, &ast;matakut, is widely reflected. The transitive form, _&ast;matakut-i-_, has fewer reflexes, and it is possible that it reflects parallel innovations in various Oceanic languages. The reason for this inference is that the prefix _&ast;ma-_ is a stative formative that was originally incompatible with the transitive marker _&ast;-i-_.

[POc &ast;_matakut_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-1-584-POc-matakut-a)


<a id="p-585"></a>

A number of NNG and PT languages have BPMs to express fear, but their components differ from one language to the next. For example:

[5-11-4-1-585-nng-mangap-kuliimozoro](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-1-585-nng-mangap-kuliimozoro)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Ashamed, embarrassed, shy


The next term is remarkable among emotion terms in being reconstructable right back to PAn with very high consistency of meaning. The emotion, for which there is no single equivalent English term, is valued as an instrument of social control, most effective in small communities. As described by Charles Valentine with reference to Nakanai speakers,

> The feeling is described as a kind of acute embarrassment which is occasioned by public exposure, violation of modesty, recognition of deception, social exclusion, and certain other forms of interaction in which the subject feels threatened by the inappropriateness of his relations with others. ([Valentine 1963](Source#cldf:Valentine1963):445)

<a id="p-586"></a>


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Love, be compassionate, be sorry for, have pity, sympathise


The English term love is polysemous, with one meaning, ‘romantic love’, given an importance in Western societies that is not generally paralleled elsewhere. In Tahitian _maʔa-maʔa_ is translated by Levy as

> to be crazy, bizarre (incl. being romantically in love). This is considered somewhat bad and abnormal. (1973:305)

Across Oceanic languages, terms for ‘to be lovers’[^5] are distinct from terms that denote caring about someone, and terms used to refer to the latter include an emotion akin to compassion. This semantic frame is labelled SORRY here, in recognition of the fact that the word _sore_ encodes this frame in both Papua New Guinea Tok Pisin and Vanuatu Bislama. Motu _hebogahisi_ ‘pity, compassion’ is instructive, combining _boga_ ‘belly, seat of desire and affection’ with _hisi_ ‘pain’. Other glosses combining what in English are distinct emotions include Gedaged _ilo- pani_ [inside- give] ‘sympathise with, love, pity, yearn for, feel for, commiserate with, mourn for, be homesick for s.o., s.t.’; Tolai _māri_ ‘to love, pity, have compassion for’, Roviana _tataru_ ‘to pity, love’, To’aba’ita _tatakomia_ ‘have a feeling of deep affection for s.o., s.t., such as sorrow, pity, compassion, mercy, love or admiration’, Arosi _tabai_ ‘to love, pity’, Rotuman _ruu_ ‘to love, value, care greatly for, feel solicitude’. English speakers, on the other hand, are more likely to include ‘love’ as an extension of ‘like’, ‘admire’ and a range of terms for ‘desire’.


<a id="p-587"></a>

As noted in [§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-11), the SORRY frame is one of the meanings of widely distributed reflexes of POc (VI) _&ast;drodrom_, (VT) _&ast;drom-i_ ‘think, worry; love, be sorry for, long for’. A dedicated SORRY verb, POc _&ast;qarop_, _&ast;qarop-i-_ ‘feel pity, empathy, be sorry for’,[^6] was inherited from PMP but is reflected only in SES and Pn languages. The Arosi reflex and all Pn reflexes reflect an apparent PEOc _&ast;qarop-a_. The suffix _&ast;-a_ probably reflects the POc nominaliser _&ast;an_.

[PMP &ast;_qarep_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-3-587-POc-qarop-a)

Two further cognate sets, each with few reflexes, permit the reconstruction of SORRY morphemes. The first, POc _&ast;dolom_, is restricted to NWS and SES languages and may represent local innovations, but Nehan is the northernmost NWS language, so it is unlikely that the set is due to borrowing. It is likely that &ast;dolom was a noun, as the Gela and Longgu transitives in _-vi_ (for †_dolom-i-_) appear to reflect a PSES formation.

[POc &ast;_dolom_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-3-587-POc-dolom-a)


<a id="p-588"></a>

The set below is restricted to WOc. If the Iduna items reflect the same etymon, then its PWOc form was _&ast;(q)uduqu_, but there is no three-syllable reflex ito confirm this.

[PWOc &ast;_(q)udu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-3-588-PWOc-qudu-a)

A number of languages have BPMs for the SORRY meaning, but their components usually differ from language to language. Examples include:

[5-11-4-3-588-adm-nyindrou-adehadruinta](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-3-588-adm-nyindrou-adehadruinta)

In many of these BPMs, however, the modifying component has no meaning independent of the BPM in which it occurs.


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Happy


BPMs for ‘happy’, ‘cheerful’, ‘joyful’, ‘glad’, ‘carefree’ often have ‘good’ as their modifying component. This is sometimes a reflex of POc _&ast;puia_ ‘good’ or PEOc _&ast;leka_ ‘good, pleasant’ ([§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:5-11)).

[5-11-4-4-588-nng-takia-ilouyan](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-4-588-nng-takia-ilouyan)


<a id="p-589"></a>

While some Pn languages use a BPM with _fiafia_ ‘happy’ as its modifying element, many of them use _fiafia_ alone, as in the set below.

[PPn &ast;_fia-fia_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-4-589-PPn-fiafia-a)

It is just possible that POc had a single word, _&ast;puiawa-_, for ‘happiness’ (or ‘happy’), apparently derived from _&ast;puia_ ‘good’ ([§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:5-11)). However, this derivation involves positing an otherwise unknown morpheme _&ast;-wa-_, and possible reflexes are few.

[POc &ast;_puia-wa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-4-589-POc-puiawa-a)


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Sad


No simple lexeme can be reconstructed for ‘sad’. Instead. many Oceanic languages use a BPM for ‘sad’, and related meanings like ‘depressed’, ‘miserable’ and ‘unhappy’, and here there are some consistent patterns. One pattern combines ‘insides’ or ‘mind’ with a term meaning ‘heavy’. The fact that no _&ast;qate-_ terms have been collected for ‘sad’-like emotions is possibly because these are seen as passive, non-violent. As [Bugenhagen](Source#cldf:Bugenhagen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Bugenhagen2001):96) has argued for Mangap, _&ast;qate-_ terms occur most often with rash, impetuous emotions.

[5-11-4-5-589-nng-yabem-allmwapa](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-5-589-nng-yabem-allmwapa)

The Polynesian terms typically use a modifier reflecting POc &ast;mapat ‘heavy’ ([vol.2:213](ContributionTable?anchor=p-213#cldf:2-7)), without body part.

[5-11-4-5-589-pn-tongan-mafasia](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-5-589-pn-tongan-mafasia)

Terms for ‘sad’ often overlap with those for ‘angry’ ([§3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:5-11)). A second pattern uses ‘insides’ + ‘bad’ for ‘sad’ and a range of ‘feeling bad’ emotions that includes sadness and anger. In some cases the ‘bad’ word is a reflex of POc _&ast;saqat_ ‘bad’ ([§11.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-2#cldf:5-11)):

[5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-ilosaian](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-ilosaian)

In other cases another term for ‘bad’ is used:

[5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-tiaesaian](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-tiaesaian)

A less frequent but widely distributed BPM for ‘sad’ or ‘angry’ is ‘insides’ + ‘sick/painful’:

[5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-ilomadai](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-5-589-nng-takia-ilomadai)


<a id="p-590"></a>


<a id="p-591"></a>


<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Angry


No reconstructions are proposed. Languages typically have a number of terms for various kinds of anger varying with the intensity of emotion and the construal of the triggering event. The following BPMs are from Yabem (NNG):

[5-11-4-6-591-nng-yabem-ttagoau](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-4-6-591-nng-yabem-ttagoau)

Anger often overlaps with sadness insofar as BPMs of the pattern ‘insides’ + ‘bad’ and ‘insides’ + ‘painful’ mean either ‘angry’ or ‘sad’ or both. Examples are given in [§11.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-5#cldf:5-11).

The examples below, although ranging in meaning from ‘cross’ to ‘indignant’ to ‘furious’, all contain metaphors that relate to heat or fire or its consequences.

### 4.7. Confused


Terms from three languages support a PEOc reconstruction:

[PEOc &ast;_lole_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-7-591-PEOc-lole-a)

Some languages, like Maori above, express mental confusion by describing the mind as tangled (as of vegetation), while two SES languages below describe the mind as closed or blocked:

<a id="p-592"></a>


<a id="s-4-8"></a>

### 4.8. Surprised


Not unexpectedly a number of terms for ‘surprised’ are perceived as associated with fear and used also for ‘alarmed’ or ‘shocked’. In both the Pn and Mic cognate sets given below there is also an association with being woken suddenly.

A recurrent metaphor incorporates words for jumping or flying using reflexes of POc

FIXME: what to do with next line, protoform without protolang &ast;Ropok ‘to fly’ ([§6.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-2#cldf:5-11).1. Micronesian and Polynesian terms occur without body part.) NNG: Lukep             kate rō            [liver flew] ‘excited to the point of forgetting what one was doing’ PT:  Kiriwina          i-yowa lopo-la     [it-flew belly-his] ‘he leapt in surprise’ PT:  Kukuya            viau novo          ‘frighten, ambush, surprise s.o.’ (viau ?)

[PPn &ast;_ofo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-4-8-592-PPn-ofo-a)

Nakanai uses the same metaphor with a non-cognate term for the verb:

## 5. Desiring and wanting


We have included desire and wanting in this chapter because in some contexts (being envious, homesick) it has a strong emotional basis.[^7] In others, of course—lacking food (§[§4.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-3#cldf:5-11).1–2) or sleep ([§4.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-2#cldf:5-11)), sexual desire ([§4.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-2#cldf:5-11).2)—it denotes a physical rather than emotional need.

The most striking result of our searches for ways in which POc speakers expressed ‘want’ and ‘desire’ is the absence of any consistency of expression in modern languages outside the Central Pacific (Fij + Pn) group. A major reason for this is that, as a result of the ubiquity and frequency of ‘want’ in the world’s languages, ‘want’ words tend strongly to undergo grammaticisation and to end up as particles in the slots otherwise reserved for tense, aspect and especially mood markers. The endpoint of this tendency is that the ‘want’ morpheme undergoes extension of function and becomes a future or irrealis morpheme, accompanied by the innovation of new ways of expressing ‘want’. Thus in Takia (NNG) the ‘want’ morpheme is the enclitic _&ast;=[w]o_, which occupies the first of a series of postverbal enclitic slots (Ross 2008) that are otherwise occupied by aspect or mood morphemes:

[5-11-5-None-593-nng-takia-leo](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-593-nng-takia-leo)

In Longgu (SES) the ‘want’ morpheme is preverbal tali, in the same structural position as certain aspectual morphemes and the negator ([Hill 1992](Source#cldf:Hill1992)):

[5-11-5-None-593-ses-longgu-taliinu](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-593-ses-longgu-taliinu)

A number of languages of the Southeast Solomons, Fiji and Polynesia are like Longgu: they have a pre-verbal particle or prefix meaning ‘want’, but the SES and Wayan Fijian forms show no relation to each other, nor to PCP _&ast;via_ below.

[5-11-5-None-593-ses-areare-siri](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-593-ses-areare-siri)

Data supporting the reconstruction of PCP _&ast;via_ ‘want to’ are given below.

[PMP &ast;_pian_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-593-POc-pian-a)


<a id="p-594"></a>

As noted in §[§4.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-3#cldf:5-11).1–2 and [§4.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6-2#cldf:5-11).1 Central Pacific languages express the concepts of being hungry, thirsty and sleepy as sequences of ‘want to’ + verb:

- PCP _&ast;via kani_ ‘be hungry’ (lit. ‘want eat’)
- PCP _&ast;via inu_ ‘be thirsty’ (lit. ‘want drink’)
- PCP _&ast;via moze_ ‘be sleepy’ (lit. ‘want sleep’)

Since PCP _&ast;via_ apparently reflects PMP _&ast;pian_, the reconstruction of POc _&ast;pia(n)_ can be inferred. However, it seems to have been displaced in non-Central Pacific Oceanic languages by a variety of lexical strategies.

A range of languages use reflexes of POc _&ast;mate_ ‘to die’ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:5-11).2) to express an intense need, particularly for such things as food, water, or betelnut, paralleling the English expressions ‘dying for a smoke’ etc.

[5-11-5-None-594-nng-takia-youomat](cf.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-594-nng-takia-youomat)

In a number of languages, desire is strongly identified with the reflex of POc _&ast;lalo-_, _&ast;lalom_ ‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’ or whatever has replaced it as the term for ‘mind’ ([§9.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-4#cldf:5-11)). The following example from Bugenhagen’s Mangap-Mbula grammar (1995:223) illustrates how this works (or in some languages, once worked):[^8]


<a id="p-595"></a>

[5-11-5-None-595-26](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-595-26)

A more literal translation is ‘My inside/thought/desire (was) that I would go at night.’ This Kalokalo (PT) sentence has a similar structure ([Guderian & Guderian 2002](Source#cldf:GuderianandGuderian2002)).

[5-11-5-None-595-27](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-595-27)

In some languages the ‘mind’ noun has been (half-)transformed into a verb, as in Lewo (NCV), where the transitive verbal suffix _-ni_ is attached to the ‘mind’ noun _sine-_ ‘guts’ and its possessor suffix, in this instance _-la_ ‘their’ ([Early 1994a](Source#cldf:Early1994a)).

[5-11-5-None-595-28](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-595-28)

[Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1937) ([1937](Source#cldf:Ivens1937)) shows that the Gela ‘mind’ term _lio-_ is similarly used. It takes a possessor suffix like any inalienably possessed noun, but is accompanied by the verbal morphemes that one would expect with a verb like ‘want’.

Finally, another strategy for expressing ‘want’ is to use the verb ‘say’, a natural extension of internal speech and thought. In Bariai (NNG) _keo_ serves as both ‘say’ and ‘want’, but its sense is disambiguated by the construction that follows it ([Gallagher & Baehr 2005](Source#cldf:GallagherandBaehr2005)).

[5-11-5-None-595-29](examplegroups.csv#cldf:5-11-5-None-595-29)

[Bowern](Source#cldf:Bowern2011) ([2011](Source#cldf:Bowern2011):151) notes a similar development in Titan (Adm).


<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Evaluation: good vs bad


Because what is experienced may be animate, inanimate or abstract and because evaluation is in the mind of the experiencer, evaluative terms, particularly those for ‘good’ and ‘bad’, may be applied to both animates and inanimates. As value terms they stand alone, but they are also a component of BPMs ([§9.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9-5#cldf:5-11)) or they follow terms used specifically to mark a quality as customary or habitual ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:5-11)).


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Good


Terms for ‘good’ have been difficult to reconstruct. Two reconstructions are proposed: POc _&ast;puia_ and PEOc _&ast;leka_.


<a id="p-596"></a>

With regard to _&ast;puia_, originally an alternant _&ast;uia_ was reconstructed. The reflexes that require this are those from Takia and its neighbours and Hote, shown under ‘cf. also’. These appear to be instances of an idiosyncratic sound change in a frequently used item. However, the Loniu, Titan and Sio reflexes are those that would have occurred if _&ast;p_ were between two vowels. and it is reasonable to infer that in these languages, at least, the reflex of _&ast;puia_ once behaved as a stative verb and took subject prefixes (e.g. i- 3SG). The Gitua and Labu forms and the second Nehan form reflect _&ast;puaia_, and this was perhaps a POc alternant.

The form _&ast;puia_ is unusual because it contains a sequence of three vowels, which is very unusual in POc (otherwise occurring, as far as is known, only in _&ast;kaiu_ ‘tree’). Indeed, it is tempting to reconstruct either †_&ast;pʷia_ or †_&ast;puya_ in order to adhere to a POc canonic shape, but †_&ast;pʷia_ is eliminated by Loniu, Kaiep, Manam and Nehan reflexes, since _&ast;-u-_ is retained and _&ast;puya_ is hard to justify in the light of so many reflexes of _&ast;-i-_ rather than _&ast;-y-_.

The presence of _&ast;-u-_ in _&ast;puia_ is also unexpected, as non-Oceanic cognates reflect PMP _&ast;ma-pia_, i.e. the root is _&ast;pia_.

[PMP &ast;_ma-pia_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-6-1-596-POc-puia-a)


<a id="p-597"></a>

Reflexes of PEOc _&ast;leka_ ‘good, pleasant’ may also refer to temperaments, as in Pukapukan _(yau)leka_ [temperament good] ‘calm, gentle, mild, quiet’.

[PEOc &ast;_leka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-6-1-597-PEOc-leka-a)


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Bad


The POc term for a negative evaluation of various kinds was _&ast;saqat_ ‘bad’.

[PMP &ast;_zaqat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:5-11-6-2-597-POc-saqat-a)

A number of reflexes point to a final _&ast;-i_. Whilst the Arosi and Bauan reflexes under ‘cf. also’ self-evidently reflect &ast;saqat plus the transitive suffix _&ast;-i_, the gloss ‘bad’ indicates that this is not the source of _&ast;-i_ in the items listed below and that they perhaps reflect an alternant _&ast;saqati_.[^9]

POc _&ast;jika_ ‘be soiled, weakened’ appears to have been a stative verb used primarily of inaminates and meaning something like ‘be unfit for use’. But some languages extend their reflexes of _&ast;jika_ to describe negative emotions or behavioural qualities:

## Notes

[^1]: POc _&ast;-ka_ was an adjectival formative.

[^2]: Languages represented here that lack a fortis/lenis distinction are NNG, northerm NCV, Fijian and Polynesian languages.

[^3]: Only found in BPMs in our data.

[^4]: The root was reconstructed _&ast;Lajam_ in an earlier version of the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995). It now appears as _&ast;najam_, but the Oceanic evidence evidence points to _&ast;Lajam_, which is favoured by most Formosan reflexes (Tsou, Saaroa, Favorlang, Bunun, Kavalan) but not by Puyuma _ma-nadam_ (_-n-_ for †_-l-_) or Amis _ma-nanam_ (_-n-_ for †_-d-_). Assimilation is a possible factor in the latter case. Philippine reflexes of the bare root have _n-_ for †_l-_. These may reflect a mack-formation from PMP _&ast;ma-najam_.

[^5]: These terms are typically associated with a set of terms to do with love magic.

[^6]: Homophony with POc _&ast;qarop_ ‘face’ (N LOC) ‘front, the side usually seen’ ([vol.2:247](ContributionTable?anchor=p-247#cldf:2-8)) is due to chance, as _&ast;qarop_ ‘face’ reflects PMP _&ast;qadep_ ‘facade, front’, but _&ast;qarop_ ‘feel pity …’ reflects PMP _&ast;qarep_.

[^7]: Cf. discussion of COGITATE verbs in [§10.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10-3#cldf:5-11).

[^8]: NF denotes the non-factual complementiser: in other words, what follows it is a clause in irrealis mood.

[^9]: Another reconstruction to exhibit this variation is POc _&ast;pat_/_&ast;pati_ ‘four’.

## 1. Introduction[^1]


Kinship terms are terms used to address or refer to one’s relatives, e.g. ‘mother’, ‘son’, ‘grandfather’ and the like. Unlike the lexical items discussed elsewhere in these volumes, a language’s kinship terms form a more or less closed system. The system determines what distinctions its terms encode, and the definitions of terms are largely constrained by the system they belong to—‘largely’ because a system’s terms sometimes overlap in meaning. The goal of this chapter is to reconstruct early Oceanic kinship terms and to hypothesise the system to which they belonged.

A number of linguists and anthropologists have treated kinship terms as a window into the social organisation of present and past kinship systems. Works that reconstruct Oceanic social organisation in this way include [Rivers](Source#cldf:Rivers1914) ([1914](Source#cldf:Rivers1914)), [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1981c) ([1981c](Source#cldf:Blust1981c)), [Pawley & Green](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1984)), Hage (1999, 2001a, ch.3 of this volume) and [Turner](Source#cldf:Turner2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:Turner2007)). Moving further back in time, early Austronesian kinship systems are reconstructed by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a), [1980c](Source#cldf:Blust1980c), [1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)).

In this chapter we touch on the reconstruction of social organisation only as it relates to lexical reconstruction. A kinship terminology and the social organisation of its users are often not in a one-to-one relationship. A terminology may retain terms that reflect past social conditions. For example, a number of Oceanic kinship terminologies indicate that their communities once practised a form of cross-cousin marriage whereby a man’s preferred potential wife was his mother’s brother’s daughter. ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.5). Some communities still practised it at first contact with Europeans. Others apparently did not, yet the terms implying it still persisted, perhaps because the terminology continues to enshrine what members of the community regard as an ideal ([McKinley 1971](Source#cldf:McKinley1971)). A paper on the matrilineality of early Oceanic social structure by the late Per Hage, an anthropologist with linguistic interests, is reprinted as chapter 3 of this volume.


<a id="p-48"></a>

This chapter builds on earlier attempts to reconstruct a POc kinship terminology. Wilhelm [Milke’s 1938](Source#cldf:Milke1938) paper on POc sibling terms built on a collection of data remarkable at the time, and was expanded twenty years later ([Milke 1958b](Source#cldf:Milke1958b)) into a full reconstruction of the POc terminology. He further added to it in later papers ([Milke 1965](Source#cldf:Milke1965):345–346; 1968:158–161, 167). [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Pawley1981)) and [Pawley & Green](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1984)) provide a listing of POc kinship terms which largely follows Milke’s. [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)) includes a critique of previous reconstructions and presents a modified version of the POc terminology. The present chapter is based on a fresh analysis of a larger database that digitisation makes possible, with the consequence that its results sometimes differ from its predecessors.[^2]

Qualitatively, the data collected for this chapter fall into three rough categories. In the first category are the reasonably comprehensive accounts of kinship terminologies and associated practices that are found in some ethnographies. The second category comprises incomplete terminologies constructed from lists of kinship terms in some ethnographic writings and a few ethnographically informed dictionaries and grammars. In the third category are individual terms collected from dictionaries and wordlists. These are often glossed only vaguely, e.g., ‘uncle’, ambiguous because Oceanic languages tend to label a paternal uncle (father’s brother) and a maternal uncle (mother’s brother) differently. The sources of the first two data categories are listed in an appendix at the end of the chapter. The sources of the third kind of data are those used in chapters throughout these volumes, listed in Appendix A towards the back of the volume.

This chapter falls into four parts. The introduction continues in [§2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:6-2) with a description of two Oceanic terminologies, Nakanai and NE Ambae, providing a framework for what follows. The second ([§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:6-2)) is a typological overview of Oceanic kinship terminologies, based as far as possible on comprehensive terminologies. This leads to [§2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:6-2), describing the probable structure of the POc kinship terminology and the forms of its terms. The last and longest part ([§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:6-2)) reconstructs POc kinship terms themselves.

## 2. Introducing Oceanic kinship terminologies


This section examines the terminology in Nakanai,[^3] a MM language of New Britain, as an example of the distinctions often encoded in Oceanic terminologies. [Figure 2.1](#fig-6-2_1) shows the Nakanai terms for blood relatives, [Figure 2.2](#fig-6-2_2) for in-laws.

Before turning to Nakanai, two matters need an explanation. First, as explained in [vol.1:32](ContributionTable?anchor=p-32#cldf:1-2) and in [vol.5:75](ContributionTable?anchor=p-75#cldf:5-3)-76, most Oceanic languages outside Polynesian[^4] reflect a POc grammatical distinction between directly and indirectly possessed nouns ([Lichtenberk 1985a](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1985a)). A directly possessed POc noun took a possessor suffix, marked here with a following hyphen (e.g. _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’: _&ast;tama-gu_ ‘my father’, _&ast;tama-mu_ ‘your (singular) father’, _&ast;tama-ña_ ‘his/her father’ etc), whereas an indirectly possessed noun required no suffix. Directly possessed nouns are inalienable; that is, they are items that usually do not exist without a possessor. They include many kinship terms. But the converse is not true: not all kinship terms are directly possessed.

<a id="p-51"></a>

Secondly, in the middle of the figures is a person labelled ‘[EGO]{.smallcaps}’. [EGO]{.smallcaps} (Latin ‘I, me’) is ‘the speaker’, i.e. the person in relation to whom some other person, [ALTER]{.smallcaps} (Latin ‘other’), is labelled. Thus if I am [EGO]{.smallcaps}, my father is an [ALTER]{.smallcaps} labelled in relation to me. If he is defined in relation to some other [EGO]{.smallcaps}, he might then be my brother, my son, my grandson, and so on.


<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Attributes encoded in a kinship terminology


[Figure 2.1](#fig-6-2_1) shows that a male [EGO]{.smallcaps} distinguishes between brothers who are older than him (_tua-_) and those who are younger (_tari-_), whereas English has no term with a meaning that depends on the age of [ALTER]{.smallcaps} relative to [EGO]{.smallcaps}.

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show Nakanai terms from the perspectives of both a male and a female [EGO]{.smallcaps}.[^5] The differences between them take two forms. First, a male [EGO]{.smallcaps} refers to his brother as _tua-_ or _tari-_, whereas a female [EGO]{.smallcaps} uses _tua-_ or _tari-_ for her sister. That is, Nakanai _tua-_ and _tari-_ must be glossed ‘sibling of same sex as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’ (usually abbreviated ‘same-sex sibling’ or ‘s.s. sibling’), not ‘brother’ or ‘sister’. The sex of _tua-_ or _tari-_ depends on [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sex. Second, a male [EGO]{.smallcaps} labels his opposite-sex sibling _hatavile-_, but a female [EGO]{.smallcaps} refers to her opposite-sex sibling as _hatamale-_. We prefix the conventional ‘female’ and ‘male’ symbols to a gloss to indicate who uses it: thus _hatavile-_ ‘♂sister’ and _hatamale-_ ‘♀brother’. In English, however, no distinction between terms depends on [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sex. The distinction between English _wife_ and _husband_ encodes [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex, not [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s. Indeed, [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex plays a significant role in the English terminology, with six basic pairs: _mother_/_father_, _aunt_/_uncle_, _sister_/_brother_, _daughter_/_son_, _niece_/_nephew_ and _wife_/_husband_. Nakanai has only one: _tila-_/_tama_ ‘mother/father’. Note, too, that [EGO]{.smallcaps} distinguishes among s.s. siblings by age relative to [EGO]{.smallcaps}, but labels o.s. siblings by their ([ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s) own sex.

In the figures and elsewhere, generations are indicated with, e.g., G₀ ‘[EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation’, G₊₁ ‘one generation above [EGO]{.smallcaps}’, G₋₂ ‘two generations below [EGO]{.smallcaps}’, and so on. In [Figure 2.1](#fig-6-2_1), _tubu-_ appears against G₊₂, indicating that all members of G₊₂ are _tubu-_ in Nakanai. It also exemplifies the classificatory nature of Oceanic kinship terms. The term _tubu-_ labels all members of G₊₂. Most kinship terminologies include classifying terms. English has some too: _uncle_ labels [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s brothers, father’s sisters’ husbands, mother’s brothers and mother’s sisters’ husbands. _Aunt_ and _cousin_ are also classifying. Nakanai and English classify siblings-in-law in the same way: English _brother-in-law_ refers to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s wife’s brother and to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sister’s husband, and Nakanai _iva-_ does the same.

Some kinship terms in Oceanic languages are used reciprocally. A Nakanai [EGO]{.smallcaps} refers to his/her mother’s brother as _hala-_ and, when [EGO]{.smallcaps} is a child’s _hala-_, he refers to his sister’s child as _hala-_. That is, the term is reciprocal across generations. [Figure 2.1](#fig-6-2_1) also shows that some grandparents and grandchildren refer to each other reciprocally as _tubu-_.

The Nakanai terminology classifies blood relatives of G₊₁ in a particular way. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s brother is labelled with the same term as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father, and [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s sister with the same term as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother. This has two consequences. One is that father’s brother’s descendants have the same labels as father’s descendants, and mother’s sister’s descendants the same labels as mother’s. The other consequence is that what in English would be _cousins_ fall into two Nakanai categories. Father’s brother’s and mother’s sister’s children are labelled as if they were [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s siblings, but father’s sister’s and mother’s brother’s children have a different label, _lavo-_. In the kinship literature the former are labelled ‘parallel cousins’, the latter ‘cross-cousins’. ‘Cross’ here refers to the fact that cross-cousins are related to [EGO]{.smallcaps} via opposite-sex parents. The classifying attribute of Oceanic kinship terms is discussed further in [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2).


<a id="p-52"></a>

The last few paragraphs have touched on various attributes of kinship terminologies in general. Their presence or absence in Nakanai and English is summed up in [Table 2.1](#table-2.1). Presence is shown by a tick. A particular attribute may or may not be reflected in a terminology.[^6] For example, English has no terms that depend on sex relative to [EGO]{.smallcaps}.

‘Sex of linking relative’ refers to the contrast between, e.g. ‘father’s brother’ and ‘mother’s brother’.

<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. ‘Parallel’, ‘cross’ and kinship notation


As noted above, ethnographers use the terms ‘parallel cousin’ for cousins related to [EGO]{.smallcaps} via mother’s sister or father’s brother and ‘cross-cousin’ for those related to [EGO]{.smallcaps} via mother’s brother or father’s sister.[^7] Similar terms are sometimes used of siblings, such that a ‘s.s. sibling’ is a sibling of the same sex as [EGO]{.smallcaps} and a ‘cross-sibling’ or ‘cross-sex sibling’ is of the opposite sex to [EGO]{.smallcaps}. This usage is inconsistent, as ‘parallel cousin’ and ‘cross-cousin’ refer to their parent’s sex, not their own, and the latter sometimes needs to be stipulated as in ‘same-sex cross-cousin’ or ‘opposite-sex cross-cousin’. For consistency’s sake, we follow [Murdock 1949](Source#cldf:Murdock1949), [1968a](Source#cldf:Murdock1968a)). replacing ‘cross-sibling’ by ‘opposite-sex sibling’ (‘o.s. sibling’).

<a id="p-53"></a>

In the interests of space, glosses in cognate sets ([§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:6-2)) and figures employ a version of the conventional ethnographic abbreviations for kinship terms. Its basic building blocks are shown in [Table 2.2](#table-2.2). In each of the four sub-table, the third abbreviation, an innovation borrowed from [Hage](Source#cldf:Hage2001b) ([2001b](Source#cldf:Hage2001b)), embraces the two categories above it. These capture Oceanic categories and reduce abbreviations so that, for example, ‘parent’s sibling’ is expressed as ‘PG’, instead of the more conventional ‘FB, MB, FZ, MZ’. The syntax of these terms is straightforward, e.g. MZ ‘mother’s sister’, EGC ‘spouse’s sibling’s child’, and so on.

There are four modifiers, each abbreviated as a lower-case letter preceding one of the letters in [Table 2.2](#table-2.2). They are:

|     |                                                                      |
|:----|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s   | same sex as [EGO]{.smallcaps}                                        |
| o   | opposite sex to [EGO]{.smallcaps}                                    |
| y   | younger than [EGO]{.smallcaps} within [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation |
| e   | elder than [EGO]{.smallcaps} within [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation   |

Thus oC ‘opposite sex child’; ysG ‘younger same-sex sibling’.

Relative sex is reckoned relative to [EGO]{.smallcaps} in order to avoid ambiguity. Hence EGsC ‘spouse’s sibling’s child of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sex’, not ‘spouse’s siblings’s child of spouse’s sibling’s sex’. However, there are terms that encode sex relative to someone other than [EGO]{.smallcaps}, and in these cases curly brackets are used, e.g. {PsG}C ‘child of parent’s same-sex sibling’,[^8] i.e. ‘parallel cousin’, as opposed to PsGC ‘child of parent’s sibling of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sex’.


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Nakanai terms and their definition


Like a good many other societies in Oceania, Nakanai society has divisions based on descent ([Chowning 1965](Source#cldf:Chowning1965) calls them ‘sibs’). Some societies, like Tolai ([Fingleton 1986](Source#cldf:Fingleton1986)), have just two divisions or ‘moieties’. Others, like Nakanai, have several divisions. In many Oceanic societies descent is matrilineal (see ch 3). In other words, a child belongs to its mother’s lineage. Since marriages are between members of different divisions, this means that a father’s children belong to his wife’s division. Among [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s closer relatives the only members of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation who are of another division are cross-cousins. Being of a different division from [EGO]{.smallcaps}, they are possible marriage candidates.

Nakanai kin terms for members of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation are shown in [Table 2.4](#table-2.4). The values of the four relevant attributes (see [Table 2.1](#table-2.1)) are shown in the four rightmost columns. Each term is defined by a unique set of values. The cross-cousin term _lavo-_ encodes neither referent’s sex nor relative sex. Its salient feature is a social one: a _lavo-_ can be married by [EGO]{.smallcaps}.

The terms for members of G₊₁ and G₋₁ are shown in [Table 2.4](#table-2.4). Of the seven terms, four are reciprocal, giving two entries, ‘+1’ and ‘–1’ in the ‘Generation’ column.’ Notably the terms in [Table 2.3](#table-2.3) are defined by a different set of attributes from those in [Table 2.4](#table-2.4), i.e. they make different distinctions.

Terms at G₊₁ in [Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3) and at G₋₁ in [Figure 2.4](#fig-6-2_4) follow a rule. The wife of any _tama-_ is a _tila-_ and vice versa. The wife of any _hala-_ is an _isa-_ and vice versa. This accounts, for example, for the fact that in [Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3) father’s sister’s husband is labelled _hala-_ and mother’s sister’s husband _tama-_.


<a id="p-54"></a>

[Table 2.3](#table-2.3) Nakanai kinship terms of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation

[Table 2.4](#table-2.4) Nakanai kinship terms of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation


<a id="p-55"></a>

In [Figure 2.1](#fig-6-2_1) there is just one reciprocal term for members of G₊₂ and G₋₂. This is _tubu-_ ‘grandparent/grandchild’. However, at G₋₂ _tubu-_ is restricted to the grandchildren of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s s.s. siblings and s.s. parallel cousins, whilst the grandchildren of o.s. siblings and o.s. parallel cousins are labelled _lavo-_. This also seems to be rule-governed. Because Nakanai society is matrilineal and [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s spouse is of a different division from ego, male [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s _latu-_ ‘children’ are not of his lineage or division, but his sister’s children, _hala-_, are. The situation is reversed if [EGO]{.smallcaps} is female: _latu-_ are of her division, but _isa-_ are not. The rule then stipulates one uses _tubu-_ for the child of one’s _latu-_, but _lavo-_ for the child of one’s _hala-_ or _isa-_.

The application of _tubu-_ to the children of one’s cross-cousins, i.e. relatives of the same generation as one’s children, not one’s grandchildren, is obscure, but is touched on in [§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:6-2).

In many Oceanic cultures the mother’s oldest living brother has the greatest authority within his matriline to instruct his sister’s children on societal matters and to make decisions about matters such as their marriages. The way in which this authority relates to that of the father, who does not belong to his children’s division, varies from society to society. The role of the mother’s oldest brother means that there is typically a dedicated term for mother’s brothers. In Nakanai this is _hala-_. The fact that in many Oceanic cultures mother’s oldest brother had or has significant responsibilities towards his sister’s children (♂ZC) is enshrined in a special term that a male [EGO]{.smallcaps} uses to refer to those children. It also captures the fact that in a matrilineal society a man’s sister’s son is his heir. The special term for sister’s son/sister’s child is sometimes the term for MB, used reciprocally, as it is in Nakanai (see further [§2.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-2#cldf:6-2).2).

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 and Tables 2.3 and 2.4 are unavoidably limited in scope, and the classificatory senses of the terms are not presented fully. Classifying terms are wide in scope. Indeed, most cover a theoretically unbounded set of relationships. How can one capture the sets that these glosses represent? For _tama-_, for example, an exhaustive definition might be:

- male blood relative of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s generation, related to [EGO]{.smallcaps} through [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s
  male ancestors and their male descendants; and
- husband of female blood relative of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s generation; the female relative is
  related to [EGO]{.smallcaps} through [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s female ancestors and their female descendants.

This definition includes ‘father’ and ‘father’s brother’ as primary referents. Both are grandfather’s sons, or FFS. They and grandfather’s brother’s son are _great-grandfather’s_ _grandsons_—and so on. Tracking back through ego’s ancestry using the first part of the definition gives a set of glosses for _tama-_: FFS, FFFSS, FFFFSSS and so on, abbreviated as FnFSn, where the two instances of n are equal. Doing the same with the second part gives MnMDnH. Glosses of this kind, not used elsewhere in this chapter, serve to show that classifying terms denote theoretically unbounded but definable classes in many Oceanic languages, and are in this respect fundamentally different from English. The Tolai (MM), for example, who number in the tens of thousands, see themselves as all related[^9] and as members of one of the two Tolai divisions (moieties), and therefore as having a kin relationship with every other Tolai ([Epstein 1969](Source#cldf:Epstein1969):122; [Fingleton 1986](Source#cldf:Fingleton1986):304).


<a id="p-56"></a>

Ethnographers argue over whether a term like Nakanai _tama-_ has one meaning or more than one.[^10] Those who argue for two or more meanings (polysemy) distinguish between a narrow sense, ‘father’, and a classificatory sense, FₙFSₙ ([Malinowski 1929](Source#cldf:Malinowski1929):442, 495–96, 513, 527; [Lounsbury 1965](Source#cldf:Lounsbury1965); [Scheffler 2003](Source#cldf:Scheffler2003); [Shapiro 2018](Source#cldf:Shapiro2018)). Those who argue for one meaning (monosemy) regard something like the definitions above as the appropriate gloss of _tama-_ ([Leach 1958](Source#cldf:Leach1958), attacking Malinowski; [Schneider 1984](Source#cldf:Schneider1984)). The question for a linguist is, What would a dictionary definition look like, and why? Pawley & Sayaba’s draft dictionary of Wayan Fijian has the following (edited and reordered):

> _tama-_ 1. Father. 2. Classificatory father, one who is brother or classificatory brother to one’s father. 3. Uncle, specifically the husband of one’s mother's sister or classificatory sister.

This is clearly a polysemous definition. It is perhaps a linguistic universal that speakers often use a term with a narrow sense for a larger class of which the narrow-sense referent is perceived as the most salient member. How this occurs in folk classifications of plants and animals is discussed by [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Evans2008)) and [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley2011b) ([2011b](Source#cldf:Pawley2011b)) respectively. The definition above is an example of this broad phenomenon in the context of a kinship terminology.

Ethnographic accounts indicate that, for example, ‘father’ in the narrow sense typically has a relationship with his offspring that is closer to them than that of his brothers and other classificatory ‘fathers’, and that speakers certainly understand and act on a difference between the two senses ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):36–37; [Humphreys 1926](Source#cldf:Humphreys1926):34; [Malinowski 1929](Source#cldf:Malinowski1929):442–443; [Powdermaker 1933](Source#cldf:Powdermaker1933):137–138; [Mead 1934](Source#cldf:Mead1934):220; [Blackwood 1935](Source#cldf:Blackwood1935):59–60; [Fischer 1966](Source#cldf:Fischeretal1966):117; [Hogbin 1964a](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a):17; [Scheffler 1965](Source#cldf:Scheffler1965):75–76; [Wagner 1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986): xvi, 62).

This issue leads into another ethnographic question. Are definitions of kinship terms cognitively real? Do they reflect speakers’ concepts? [Goodenough](Source#cldf:Goodenough1956) ([1956](Source#cldf:Goodenough1956), [1965](Source#cldf:Goodenough1965)) answered ‘yes’; [Burling](Source#cldf:Burling1964) ([1964](Source#cldf:Burling1964)) vigorously ‘no’. A dictionary-maker would argue that dictionary definitions should be a good approximation of cognitive reality, otherwise speakers cannot agree (or disagree) with them.

## 3. The typology of Oceanic kinship terminologies


The typology of Oceanic kinship terminologies briefly presented here is based on 139 cases where a complete or near-complete terminology is available covering ego’s parents and their siblings and the parents’ and siblings’ children. Ideally each terminology should also include all their children, but many otherwise detailed ethnographies omit terms for the children of some or all of ego’s cousins. The terminologies also cover members of the grandparent and grandchild generations. Sources are in the appendix to this chapter.

These 139 languages are referred to below as ‘the sample’, but they are not a sample chosen for statistical purposes. They are simply the languages for which relevant data are available. NCV is under-represented, New Caledonia and Fiji over-represented. Nonetheless, they are distributed throughout Oceanic.

The typological investigation in [§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)–4 does not cover in-law terms.

### 3.1. Bifurcate merging and its modifications


The Nakanai terminology in [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2) exemplifies the fact that a terminology’s semantic structure determines the meaning of each term. Conversely, each term covers one or more kinship slots, e.g. tama- covers F, FB and MZH (and more). If the slots covered by each term laterally as far as and including ego’s parents’ siblings are diagrammed, we have a visual representation of a terminology’s structure, as in Figures 2.3 and 2.4.

[Lowie](Source#cldf:Lowie1928) ([1928](Source#cldf:Lowie1928)) categorised kinship terminologies, based on how they treat G₊₁. He called terminologies like Nakanai ‘__bifurcate merging__’—‘bifurcate’, because the terms for ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are distinct, and ‘merging’ because each parent and her/his s.s. siblings are merged terminologically (called by the same term), but o.s. siblings are labelled differently ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2)).

Lowie’s ‘__generational__’ category, where all uncles and aunts are treated as parents, turns up in a sprinkling of Oceanic languages (see later in this section).

<a id="fig-6-2_3"> </a>

[__Figure 2.3:__ Structure of the Nakanai terminology, showing bifurcate merging terms](MediaTable#cldf:fig-6-2_3)



<a id="fig-6-2_4"> </a>

[__Figure 2.4:__ Structure of English terminology, showing lineal terms](MediaTable#cldf:fig-6-2_4)




<a id="p-58"></a>

English, on the other hand, Lowie classed as ‘__lineal__’ because terms for ego’s ancestors and descendants (‘lineal kin’), as well as siblings, are distinct from those for uncles, aunts and cousins (‘collateral kin’), which are all categorised by generation. There are no Oceanic lineal terminologies.[^11]

[Murdock](Source#cldf:Murdock1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Murdock1949)) extends Lowie’s definitions by including G₀ as well as G₊₁. Thus a bifurcate merging terminology is one which is

1. bifurcate: there are distinct terms for ‘mother’ and ‘father’ (M ≠ F);
2. merging:
   a. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father and father’s brother are both called ‘father’ and [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother and
      mother’s sister are both called ‘mother’ (FB = F, MZ = M);
   b. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s brother’s and mother’s sisters children, [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s parallel cousins, are
      called by the same terms as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s siblings (FBC = MZC = G).
3. laterally restricted:
   a. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s brother is called by a term other than ‘father’ and [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s
      sister by a term other than ‘mother’ (MB ≠ F, FZ ≠ M);
   b. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s brother’s and father’s sisters children, ego’s cross-cousins, are called
      by terms other than those for ego’s siblings (MBC ≠ G, FZC ≠ G).

The grey rectangle in [Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3) encloses the part of the terminology that is ‘merged’.

A working definition of ‘merging’ is needed here. Sources sometimes give binomials (terms consisting of two lexical items), like Sye (SV) _drinme- pelaɣ_ ‘mother’s sister’, where _drinme-_ is ‘mother’ and _pelaɣ_ apparently means ‘removed’, ‘apart’ or, with kinship terms, ‘adoptive’ (there is no _pelaɣ_ entry in [Crowley 2000](Source#cldf:Crowley2000)). Because the second, modifying, part of many binomials is omitted in daily use, a kinship binomial like _drinme- pelaɣ_ is counted for analytic purposes as ‘the same’ as _drinme-_ ‘mother’, i.e., as merged.

Of the 139 sample languages, 65 (47%) are bifurcate merging in accordance with the definition above.

At the core of a bifurcate merging structure are the mergers in (2) above and, remarkably, they are found in 137 of the 139 sample languages. One language, Sye, lacks one of the mergers in (2a), and two, Sye and Nadrau Fijian, lack (2b).[^12] However, whereas the mergers in (2) are near-universal in Oceanic, there are numerous languages that do not conform to the definitions in (3), because at least one term for a merged category is extended to include a G₊₁ or G0 term outside the rectangle. In some languages the restriction in (3a) is breached, in others the restriction in (3b), and in yet others both restrictions in (3). The languages in which each breach occurs are shown in [Table 2.5](#table-2.5).

Taking (3a) first, two breaches occur:

i.  [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s sister is called by the term for mother/mother’s sister (FZ = M: 44 cases);
ii. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s sister and mother’s brother are called respectively by the terms for
    mother/mother’s sister and father/father’s brother (FZ = M, MB = F: 8 cases);

The case numbers tells us that FZ = M occurs far more often than MB = F. Furthermore, there is an implicational relationship such that MB = F only occurs where FZ = M occurs, but never vice versa. The distinctiveness of the ‘mother’s brother’ category is almost as durable as the mergers in (2), whereas the ‘father’s sister’ category is readily lost.

However, the loss of an FZ term has perhaps not occurred as frequently as [Table 2.5](#table-2.5) might imply. The MM languages split into two groupings. Those listed under ‘Bifurcate merging’ are all located in New Britain and New Ireland. Apart from Vitu, those listed in the other three columns are all members of the well established NW Solomonic subgroup ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988), chapter 7), and the innovation extending POc _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ to MZ probably happened in Proto NW Solomonic and was inherited by its member languages.

Turning to (3b), three breaches occur:

iii. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s cross-cousin is called by a term for sibling/parallel cousin (MBC = FBC = FZC = MZC = G, i.e. PGC = G);  this may apply to
     - only s.s. cross-cousins (2 cases);
     - only o.s. cross-cousins (4 cases);
     - all cross-cousins (40 cases).

Terminologies in which the breach applies only to s.s. or only to o.s. cross-cousins are shown in italics in the rightmost column of [Table 2.5](#table-2.5).[^13]

Each of these breaches brings a system nearer to Lowie’s generational category. The outcome of (i) above is that all female members of G₊₁ are called ‘mother’, of (ii) that all members of G₊₁ are called ‘mother’, ‘father’ or ‘parent’. The outcome of (iii), when it applies to all cross-cousins, is that all members of G₀ are called by sibling terms. Note that (i), (ii) and (iii) do not affect distinctions of sex (absolute or relative-to-ego) or relative age that a terminology may make.

[Table 2.6](#table-2.6) shows the terminologies with tendencies toward a generational structure. Column 4 adds (1), M = F, i.e. a uninomial term for ‘parent’, with ‘mother’/‘father’ distinction. A terminology that lacks this distinction is not bifurcate. There is no implicational relationship between the breaches in (2) and (3) above, but there is a strong tendency that if in a language FZ = M & MB = F, then PGC = G ([Table 2.5](#table-2.5)). The converse is not true.

Of the 46 languages where PGC = G ([Table 2.5](#table-2.5), rightmost column), 22 have no other tendency toward a generational structure ([Table 2.6](#table-2.6), column 1).

Two groups in [Table 2.6](#table-2.6) deserve comment. The first of these is the Central Papuan subgroup of PT. Sinaugoro, Motu, Roro and North Mekeo are the Central Papuan languages in the sample. The Roro structure is shown in [Figure 2.5](#fig-6-2_5). Sinaugoro, Motu and Roro retain bifurcate merging in the parental generation but have generational terminology in ego’s generation, i.e. all ego’s siblings and cousins are identically labelled, according to seniority. This was probably the situation in Proto Central Papuan. North Mekeo, however, adds generational terminology at G₊₁, shown in [Figure 2.6](#fig-6-2_6). This is almost a full-blown generational terminology, as are the others listed in column 3 of [Table 2.6](#table-2.6).

The other group in need of comment is Polynesian. Only Ifira-Mele and West Futuna (= Futuna-Aniwa) are listed in [Table 2.5](#table-2.5) as bifurcate merging. There is good reason to infer that the structure of the Ifira-Mele terminology is the result of contact with NCV languages of Nguna ([§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:6-2)). The same may be true of West Futuna, which has had contact with the languages of Tanna (SV).([Lynch & Fakamuria 1994](Source#cldf:LynchandFakamuria1994)). It is probable that PPn had a terminology like that of Tongan and similar to Roro ([Figure 2.5](#fig-6-2_5)), in which all blood-relatives of ego’s generation were labelled in the same way as ego’s siblings, but the parental generation had dedicated terms for FZ and MB ([Marck 1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996)). Loss of FZ and MB terms in various of the outliers and in PEPn resulted in structures like that in North Mekeo. However, Pukapuka, Tahitian and Hawaiian have also replaced PPn _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.1) and _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.1) with a reflex of _&ast;matuqa-_ ‘parent’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.3). The elimination of the sex distinction in the parental generation has resulted in a purely generational structure in [Lowie’s](Source#cldf:Lowie1928) ([1928](Source#cldf:Lowie1928)) sense, leading to the adoption of ‘Hawaiian’ as the term for a generational structure in [Murdock’s](Source#cldf:Murdock1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Murdock1949)) classification of kinship terminologies.

### 3.2. Other structural features involving ego’s blood relatives



<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. EGO’s siblings and parallel cousins


Bifurcate merging means that in almost every Oceanic terminology, [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s parallel cousins, i.e. [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s brother’s and mother’s sister’s children, are labelled with the same terms as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s siblings ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)). However, there is considerable variation in this labelling. For example, there may be a terminological distinction between s.s. and o.s. siblings/parallel cousins; or a seniority distinction among siblings/parallel cousins.[^14]

These distinctions are structurally independent of bifurcate merging. The most frequently found distinction is between s.s. and o.s. siblings/parallel cousins. Following this pattern, speakers of earlier New Guinea Pidgin took the terms _susa_ and _brata_ from English _sister_ and _brother_ but used them in an Oceanic manner. If I was female, my _brata_ was my sister (s.s. sibling) and my _susa_ was my brother (o.s. sibling). These two categories are further subdivided in many Oceanic terminologies. A common pattern is illustrated by Nakanai ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2); [Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3)), where s.s. siblings are divided into those elder (_tua-_) or younger (_tari-_) than [EGO]{.smallcaps}, but o.s. siblings are divided into female (_hatavile-_) and male (_hatamale-_).

There are thus three sibling distinctions in Oceanic languages:

- relative sex: same sex as [EGO]{.smallcaps} vs opposite sex from [EGO]{.smallcaps} (sG vs oG)
- seniority: younger than [EGO]{.smallcaps} vs elder than [EGO]{.smallcaps} (yG vs eG)
- [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex (Z vs B)

Eleven configurations of these distinctions occur in Oceanic languages, and [Table 2.7](#table-2.7) shows the number of times each configuration occurs in the sample.[^15] Column 1 shows whether a terminology makes the relative sex distinction (y[es] or n[o]). If it does, then there are entries in columns 2 to 5. Columns 2 and 4 show whether the seniority distinction is applied respectively to s.s. and o.s. siblings. Columns 3 and 5 do the same for [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex. But if column 1 shows that a terminology lacks the relative sex distinction, then columns 4 and 5 are blank, because o.s. siblings are referred to by the same terms as s.s. siblings. For example, Nakanai makes the s.s./o.s. distinction (column 1), the seniority distinction for s.s. siblings (column 2), and uses different o.s. terms according to [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex (column 5). It is thus one of the 17 languages with the configuration in row 6. The column totals show that only four terminologies distinguish [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex in the terms for s.s. siblings, and that only three distinguish seniority of o.s. siblings. The four configurations that include one of these distinctions are shown in grey (3, 4, 7 and 8) and are presumably the outcomes of local accidents.[^16] Theoretically, 20 configurations are possible, but only 11 occur in [Table 2.7](#table-2.7)—or more properly ten, as row 9 contains question marks for unknown values.[^17] Whilst one can speculate about the reasons for the absence or near-absence of certain configurations, it is clear that they reflect absences from the POc terminology ([§2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:6-2)). [Table 2.8](#table-2.8) shows the languages in the six most attested categories in [Table 2.7](#table-2.7).

<a id="p-65"></a>

In the vast majority of Oceanic languages, terms for parallel cousins are identical to those for siblings, but there is a dimension that is not represented here. In some languages, as one might expect, terms for [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s younger and elder siblings are applied to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s younger and elder parallel cousins. In other languages, however, the terms make reference not to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s seniority but to seniority of the cousin’s parent relative to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s parent. For example, if the parallel cousin is [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s sister’s child, the choice of the ‘younger’ or ‘elder’ term depends on whether the cousin’s mother is younger or elder than [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother. This matter is not pursued here, as the data often do not allow us to determine who seniority refers to in a given terminology.


<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Children


Strangely, perhaps, discussion of terms for children is necessarily preceded by a short return to terms for father’s sister and mother’s brother, a topic in the discussion of bifurcate merging ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)). Their relevance here is that ‘mother’s brother’ and ‘sister’s child’ are the same (reciprocal) term in some languages. In other scattered languages, ‘mother’s brother’ is the same term as ‘father’s sister’.[^18] However, these two categories almost never overlap: that is, there is no language in the sample in which ‘mother’s brother’, ‘father’s sister’ and ‘sister’s child’ are all the same term. Two exceptions are the Fijian dialects Moala and Lakeba, where FZ, MB and ♂ZC are all _vuŋo-_.


<a id="p-66"></a>

The role of mother’s brother and his relationship with his sister’s children are discussed briefly at the end of [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2). In 52 terminologies each refers to the other by the same dedicated dedicated term (column 1 of [Table 2.9](#table-2.9)). In 55 others, there is a separate term for each relationship (column 2). In yet others, there is no dedicated term for ‘sister’s child’ and the latter is not distinguished from other children. It is either referred to simply as a ‘child’ or by another kinship term, the narrow meaning of which is shown in parentheses (column 3). Among the items in column 2, in Simbo (MM), Pukapuka, Rapa and Māori (EPn) the MB term is the term for ‘father’.

An odd phenomenon, commented on several times in the literature, occurs in certain SES languages. In Bugotu, Gela, Lengo and Owa, the MB term reflects POc _&ast;tubu-_ ‘grandfather’ but does not retain this meaning. It is also used reciprocally for ♂ZC.

In a few WOc languages an apparent mirror-image of the MB/♂ZC relationship is enshrined in the terminology: FZ and ♀BC are referred to by the same term. These languages are Muyuw, Galea, and Motu (PT), and Vitu and Nakanai (MM). However, terms used only by a female ego and terms for children other than ego’s child and ego’s sister’s child are often not recorded, so we do not know how widespread this reciprocal usage is.

In a scattering of languages the children of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s male blood relatives and those of female blood relatives are referred to by different terms. In these languages the term for the children of females is usually the term used for ♂ZC. Our data are in this respect too incomplete for a listing of languages to be meaningful.

In a relatively small number of languages a sex distinction is made among children. There are dedicated kinship terms for female and male children in Pak, Baluan and Lou (Adm), Lihir, Notsi, Lamusong, Barok and Patpatar (MM, New Ireland), N Ambrym (NCV) and Tongan, Tokelau, E Futuna and Rennellese (Pn).

#### 3.2.3. Grandparents and grandchildren


Some Oceanic languages have a dedicated term for mother’s mother’s brother (e.g. Tolai _kaku-_; see also [§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:6-2)), but a majority encode all grandparents and members of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s grandparents’ generation with a single term (often a reflex of POc _&ast;tubu-_; [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.1). Other languages do make a distinction between female and male members of the grandparent generation. Our data are incomplete in this regard, but these languages include: Notsi, Sursurunga and Mono-Alu (MM); Bugotu, Sa’a, W Arosi and Fagani (SES); Akei, Big Nambas, Ninde and Nguna (NCV); almost all NCal languages (exceptions are Belep in the north, Kwenyii in the south, and the languages of the Loyalties); Marshallese, and Lamotrek (Mic), numerous and scattered Fijian languages, and Ifira-Mele (Pn).

Owa (SES) has a general term _pʷāpʷā_ for members of the grandparent generation as well as _wauwa-_ ‘grandfather’ and tura- ‘grandmother’. It is quite possible that there are other languages with a similar configuration that do not show up in the sample. Sori and Pak (Adm) are recorded with separate terms for PF, MM, FM. On the other hand, a few languages have no ‘grandparent’ terms, instead using ‘mother’ and ‘father’ for both parents and grandparents. They are Simbo, Nduke and Roviana (MM), Numèè (NCal) and Satawalese and Chuukese (Mic).

Data on ‘grandchild’ terms are more complete, and fall into two categories:

- a ‘grandparent’ term is used reciprocally of both grandparents and grandchildren;
- there is a dedicated ‘grandchild’ term.

These categories mostly follow genealogical boundaries. A ‘grandparent’ term is used reciprocally to refer to grandchildren in Mussau, NNG, PT, MM, SES and Marshallese (Mic). A dedicated grandchild term is used in Yapese, Adm, NCal including the Loyalties, and throughout Fiji and Polynesia. NCV languages in the sample are divided. Most have a ‘grandchild’ term, but the northern languages Loh, Mota and Araki use ‘grandparent’ reciprocally.

Languages that also use ‘mother’ and ‘father’ for grandparents are exceptions to these generalisations. Roviana uses ‘father’ reciprocally for a grandchild, Nduke has ‘child’s child’, and Numèè (along with Kwenyii), Satawalese and Chuukese use ‘child’ for grandchildren as well as children.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Generational skewing


A small number of languages in the sample have ‘cross’ terms with extended meanings that are mostly quite unlike those in Nakanai. These are exemplified by NE Ambae, a north Vanuatu language ([Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7)).[^19]

Within the merged portion of the terminology, the structure of NE Ambae ([Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7)) differs from Nakanai ([Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3)) only in the unusual addition of _tue-_ ‘s.s. sibling’ as a cover term for both _tehi-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’ and _toka-_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’.

It is the ‘cross’ portion of the NE Ambae terminology in [Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7) that is of particular interest. On the left-hand side of the figure, father’s sister is also called _ratahi-_ ‘mother’, and so are the female descendants in her matriline, i.e. FZD, FZDD, FZDDD. Their brothers (FZS, FZDS, FZDDS) are all called _tama-_ ‘father’. The children of each _tama-_ are labelled in the same way as the children of the three _tama-_ in the merged portion of the figure.

The right-hand ‘cross’ portion of the terminology is different. The children of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s brother are called _natu-_ ‘child’, and their children _vaɣabui-_ ‘grandchild’.

The technical term for this phenomenon is ‘__generational skewing__’. On the left of the figure, ‘mother’, ‘father’ and the two sibling terms are used of women a generation or more below [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother. On the right of the figure, ‘child’ and ‘grandchild’ are used of individuals a generation above [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s child and grandchild. Skewing is also found in various locations outside the Austronesian family (see [Lounsbury 1964a](Source#cldf:Lounsbury1964a) and the contributions to [Trautmann & Whiteley 2012](Source#cldf:TrautmannandWhiteley2012)).

[__Figure 2.8:__ The structures of the two states of the Dobu kinship terminology](MediaTable#cldf:fig-6-2_8)



There is a plentiful literature on generationally skewed terminologies, asking how they come into being and what function they serve. However, a few things seem reasonably clear. There are two varieties of generational skewing. One is like NE Ambae, in Murdock’s terms a ‘Crow’ terminology. Its mirror-image, ‘Omaha’, is not represented in Oceanic. [Kohler](Source#cldf:Kohler1897) ([1897](Source#cldf:Kohler1897)) found that ‘Crow’ terminologies were correlated with matrilineal societies, ‘Omaha’ with patrilineal. This correlation stands as a high probability, but not an absolute, as examples of patrilineal Crow and matrilineal Omaha have since been found. The converse does not hold, i.e. unilineal (matri- or patrilineal) descent is not a good predictor of generational skewing. For example, Nakanai society is matrilineal but its terminology is not skewed.

The witness of speakers of languages with a skewed terminology gives us some indication of how skewing happens. Deacon’s ‘best’ informant for Semiang (= Sinesip, NCV) volunteered the information that if a male [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s brother died, by custom [EGO]{.smallcaps} would marry the MB’s widow, thereby becoming ‘father’ to MB’s children, and calling them ‘child’, accounting for the right-hand side of [Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7). Conversely, if [EGO]{.smallcaps} is among the children of the deceased, then their cross-cousin becomes their ‘father’, accounting for the left-hand side ([Deacon 1934](Source#cldf:Deacon1934):77-78). It seems that these uses in this circumstance have become entrenched, resulting in the skewed terminology.

[Fortune’s](Source#cldf:Fortune1932) ([1932](Source#cldf:Fortune1932)) description of Dobu (PT) kinship is significant in two ways. The Dobu terminology has two states, A and B in [Figure 2.8](#fig-6-2_8).. State A resembles the Nakanai structure of [Figure 2.3](#fig-6-2_3). There are dedicated terms for mother’s brother and father’s sister, and a single term for cross-cousins. After father’s death, state B becomes the norm, with generational skewing on the father’s side. FZD inherits her mother’s label, and her husband receives the label ‘father’. [Fortune](Source#cldf:Fortune1932) ([1932](Source#cldf:Fortune1932):37–38) provides the reason for this. The father’s place in the matriline is taken by his heir. The heir is the father’s sister’s son, so he assumes the title ‘father’, and his sister becomes ‘father’s sister’. Fortune’s consultants’ explanation of the generationally skewed state B closely resembles that of Deacon’s Sinesip consultant. As their locations are 1950 km apart as the crow flies, they are clearly independent pieces of evidence as to the reason for generational skewing.


<a id="p-70"></a>

This explains how generational skewing arises. But the fact that two terminological states coexist(ed) in Dobu society also explains how Oceanic comes to have terminologies like state A alongside terminologies like state B, not to mention terminologies with fossil fragments of state B (see below). No other Oceanic terminologies with two states are known to us, but we infer that they must exist or have existed in order for the transition between the two states to take place.

[Kronenfeld](Source#cldf:Kronenfeld2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:Kronenfeld2012)) describes a two-state terminology in the Fanti language of Ghana. The situation is similar to that in Dobu. Kronenfeld takes issue with the concept of a ‘Crow’ terminology, viewing it as a generally skewed overlay on an existing bifurcate merging (‘Iroquois’) terminology. The Fanti two-state terminology can be taken as corroborating Fortune’s account of Dobu and its historical role.

To ‘qualify’ as a fully skewed system the changes illustrated by NE Ambae in [Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7) are expected:

1. on the father’s side
   a. father’s sister’s matrilineal female descendants (FZD, FZDD, FZDDD) are referred
      to with the same term as FZ;
   b. father’s sister’s matrilineal male descendants (FZS, FZDS, FZDDS) are called
      ‘father’;
   c. the children of father’s sister’s matrilineal male descendants (FZSC, FZDSC,
      FZDDSC) are called by the same terms as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s siblings (i.e. as the children of a
      ‘father’)
2. on the mother’s side
   a. mother’s brother’s child is called by the term for [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s child’;
   b. mother’s brother’s grandchild is called by the term for [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s grandchild.

Twenty-one languages in the sample show signs of generational skewing, but only three, Mota, NE Ambae and Nguna (all NCV) qualify fully. The evidence is set out schematically in [Table 2.10](#table-2.10).[^20] The abbreviations in the first row are relationships in a genealogical tree. The abbreviations beneath them represent the narrow sense of the term that is used for that relationship. In NE Ambae, for example, the relationship of father’s sister (FZ) is referred to by the term for mother (M), the relationship of father’s sister’s son (FZS) by the term for father (F), and so on. Terms that do not reflect generational skewing are omitted for readability’s sake.

- ¹ Father’s mother is also called by the FZ term.
- ² Alternates with the term for cross-cousin.
- ³ The term is _tubo-_, reflecting POc _&ast;tubu_ PP, not reflected as PP in Notsi.

The backbone of the skewed system is the terms for the matrilineal female, FZ, FZD and FZDD, shown in grey. The observation here is that whatever term is used for FZ is also used for FZD, FZDD and FZDDD (FZDDD is not shown; cf [Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7)). In some languages, e.g. Lele (Adm), the same term is projected upwards, i.e. used for FM. The matrilineal female’s brother (FZS, FZDS) is labelled as ‘father’ (F). In Pak (Adm) a special term is used for FZS, which is then also used for FZDS.

Abbreviations in italics represent terms that have evidently been copied from elsewhere in the paradigm. For example, Nduindui terms are almost identical to those of its neighbour, NE Ambae, but the term used for FZDS is not the expected term ‘father’ but ‘sibling’, copied from FZSC. In Nduindui matrilineal moieties have been replaced by patrilineal sections. The Nduindui terms for father’s sister’s children retain the old nomenclature, but it is lost in the following generations ([Allen 1964a](Source#cldf:Allen1964a)).

Nakanai and Notsi (both MM) show only a fragment of an assumed formerly skewed system. In a terminology with skewing on the mother’s side, mother’s brother’s children (MBS and MBD) are called ‘child’ (C), and their children (MBSC and MBDC) are called ‘grandchild’. The latter are, however, of the same generation as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s children. Nakanai and Notsi retain only this peculiarity of a skewed system, and have copied the ‘grandchild’ term to the children of the paternal cross-cousins.

The sample languages include two Tolai dialects, Matupit Tolai and an unlocated dialect described by [Trevitt](Source#cldf:Trevitt1940) ([1940](Source#cldf:Trevitt1940)). This pair is interesting in that Matupit Tolai is unskewed, whereas ‘Trevitt’s Tolai’ (labelled thus in [Table 2.10](#table-2.10)) shows signs of skewing. Both dialects are shown in [Figure 2.9](#fig-6-2_9). Assuming the hypothesis that unskewed and skewed versions of a terminology initially coexist, Matupit Tolai represents the unskewed version, Trevitt’s Tolai a frozen skewed version. Trevitt’s Tolai uses the term _tubu-_ ‘grandparent’ for FZ, FZD and FZDD, presumably because, working upward, FM is _tubu-_.[^21] FZS and FZDS are not called by the expected term ‘father’, but instead _nauva-_ FZS is extended to FZDS. A peculiarity of Trevitt’s Tolai is that it uses _tama-_ reciprocally of ‘father’ and ‘child’, and this is then predictably extended to mother’s brother’s daughter (but not son), whose daughter is then labelled _tubu-_ ‘grandchild’.

The only Pn language with skewing is Ifira-Mele, and we attribute this to contact with neighbouring Nguna on the island of Efate.

### 3.4. The geography of typology


A review of Tables 2.5 to 2.10 reveals that typology rarely follows geographic or genealogical boundaries closely. This is scarcely surprising, as changes in terminological structure are likely to occur independently in different places. Without the terms themselves, changes do not provide a secure basis for determining shared innovations, as some of the comments published with [Marshall](Source#cldf:Marshall1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Marshall1984)) explain. But this does not mean that the typological investigation above is irrelevant to the reconstruction of POc and the subsequent history of Oceanic languages.

The distribution of birfurcate merging ([Table 2.5](#table-2.5)) is significant. It is strong in the Admiralties, in the New Britain/New Ireland area of MM, in New Caledonia other than the Loyalties, and in most of Fiji. This distribution, coupled with the fact that it is easier to derive other structures from bifurcate merging than vice versa, suggests that the POc terminology had bifurcate merging. However, it was lost among the small islands of Micronesia and eastern Polynesia.


<a id="p-73"></a>

The data supporting generational skewing are admittedly found in only a small minority of Oceanic languages, but their presence in quite widely distributed languages of the Admiralties, PT, the New Britain/New Ireland area of MM, and NCV points to the presence of skewing in POc.

The relabelling of father’s sister as ‘mother’ was seemingly a shared innovation in Proto NW Solomonic (MM). It is an areal tendency in SES ([Table 2.5](#table-2.5)). On the other hand the naming of all siblings and cousins, including cross-cousins, by the same terms seems to be a broad tendency that operates sporadically everywhere except SV and mainland New Caledonia. Change towards a generational structure went furthest in eastern Polynesia ([Table 2.6](#table-2.6)).

### 3.5. Reconstructing the Proto Oceanic kinship terminology


The POc kinship terms reconstructed in the subsections of [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2) (blood relatives) and [§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:6-2) (in-laws) are listed in [Table 2.11](#table-2.11) and plotted as a tree diagram in [Figure 2](#fig-6-2). First, POc kinship terms in [§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:6-2) were reconstructed. Then the terminology was assembled from the terms and their reconstructed glosses, but with an eye on the typology of terminologies presented in [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:6-2). On the division of terms into reference and address terms, and the division of certain reference terms into &ast;t-initial and &ast;t-less, see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1.

The glosses of the terms for ‘father’ and ‘mother’, based on glosses of their reflexes, support the typological evidence above that POc terminology was bifurcate merging ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)). The s.s. sibling terms distinguished _&ast;taci-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’ from _&ast;tua-_ or _&ast;tuaka-_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’. The o.s. sibling terms differentiated between the directly possessed terms _&ast;papine-_ ‘♂o.s. (female) sibling’ and &ast;mʷaqane- ‘♀o.s. (male) sibling’. These were also the POc terms for ‘wife’ and ‘husband’ ([vol.5:50](ContributionTable?anchor=p-50#cldf:5-2)–55), but when they referred to spouses they were indirectly possessed. Putative _&ast;lopu-_ ‘o.s. sibling’ is omitted from both the figure and the table as its POc status is uncertain ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.3).

There is broad agreement that early Oceanic society was matrilineal. In his survey of earlier findings of Oceanic matrilineality [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1981c) ([1981c](Source#cldf:Blust1981c):70–72) notes that [Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):30), [Deacon](Source#cldf:Deacon1934) ([1934](Source#cldf:Deacon1934):705), and [Capell and Lester](Source#cldf:CapellandLester194546) ([1945-46](Source#cldf:CapellandLester194546), part 4:315) had all suggested that at least in some parts of Melanesia, where societies with moieties are interspersed with societies that lack them, moieties are a retention, a view that Blust endorses. In his 1994 paper he shows that POc matrilineality was inherited from PMP, and points to [Murdock’s](Source#cldf:Murdock1968a) ([1968a](Source#cldf:Murdock1968a)) survey of sibling terminologies, which finds that the same-sex/opposite-sex opposition is correlated with the presence of descent groups and especially with matrilineality. More recently Hage (1999; this volume), [Hage & Marck](Source#cldf:HageandMarck2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:HageandMarck2003)) and [Marck](Source#cldf:Marck2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Marck2008)) have also argued vigorously in favour of POc matrilineality, partly on genetic grounds.

If POc was indeed matrilineal, then it presumably had two moieties like those of Tolai, NE Ambae and a number of other Oceanic languages ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2)). Symptomatic of this is the presence of two terms for ‘child’. POc _&ast;[qa]lawa-_ denoted in its narrow sense ‘sister’s child’ (i.e. the one to whom [EGO]{.smallcaps} was mother’s brother) and in its classificatory sense ‘female parallel cousin’s child’. The default term was _&ast;natu-_, the only term that, as in Tolai, switches moiety according to [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s sex: opposite moiety to [EGO]{.smallcaps} if [EGO]{.smallcaps} is male, same moiety as [EGO]{.smallcaps} if [EGO]{.smallcaps} is female.

The existence of a dedicated term, _&ast;matuqa_, for [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mother’s brother (literally ‘the old one’) reflects his role among his kin ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2)) and is further evidence of matrineality. If the society were patrilineal, the leading male among his relatives would be his father.


<a id="s-3-6"></a>

### 3.6. Generational skewing in Proto Oceanic


Previous reconstructions of POc kinship terms seem to have assumed that there must have been a separate term for [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s father’s sister. Perhaps there was, but one cannot reconstruct it ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.6). Given that most other terms for blood relatives are easily reconstructable, this blank in the terminology demands an explanation, and a fairly straightforward one emerges from the discussion of generational skewing in [§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:6-2). Like Dobu, POc apparently had two states, a state A in which there were dedicated terms for father’s sister and for cross-cousins and their children, and a state B in which these terms were replaced by generationally skewed terms. Assuming that early Oceanic speakers lived in small hamlets with perhaps one or two extended families scattered along coastlines ([vol.1:62](ContributionTable?anchor=p-62#cldf:1-3)), it is possible that children rarely heard the state A terms, rendering them liable to the replacement which is visible in the data. The few generationally skewed terminologies that exist today reflect a freezing of all or parts of state B ([Table 2.10](#table-2.10), plus others not included in the sample), but most Oceanic terminologies reflect state A, with variations resulting from a past two-state situation.


<a id="p-76"></a>

In the POc terminology in [Figure 2](#fig-6-2) the slots with terms in square brackets are essentially gaps. No distinct terms can be reconstructed for them. They are in the lineages that involve cross-cousins: father’s sister and her descendants and mother’s brother’s descendants. The terms in the brackets are the generationally skewed terms that would have been used in state B, with the exception of ‘father’s sister’. This is shown as [&ast;FZ] because the POc term is unknown. It was perhaps _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ or _&ast;tubu-_ ‘grandparent’, both discussed below.

The evidence of the languages listed in [Table 2.10](#table-2.10), like NE Ambae ([Figure 2.7](#fig-6-2_7)) and Trevitt’s Tolai ([Figure 2.9](#fig-6-2_9)), leads us to expect that [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s mothers’ brother’s children will be called ‘child’, despite the fact that they are of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s generation. This extract from the data for ‘child’ in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).3.1 confirms this. Glosses not relevant to generational skewing have been removed. A majority of the reflexes are from NCV languages. This is not surprising, as generational skewing, at least in the north of the region, is mentioned in the ethnographic literature. The presence of reflexes from the Admiralties, PT, MM (western Solomons), the Loyalties and Micronesia makes it likely that the sense ‘mother’s brother’s child’ is of POc antiquity.

[POc &ast;_natu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-3-6-76-POc-natu-a)

One would also expect that the children of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s MBC would be called by the same term as ‘grandchild’, and the data give some support to this notion. POc apparently used two terms for ‘grandchild’. POc _&ast;tubu-_ ‘grandparent’ was used reciprocally of ‘grandchild’. POc _&ast;makubu-_ was not reciprocal and meant ‘grandchild; kin two generations below ego’. The terms in the set below reflect a variety of ‘grandchild’ terms, but have in common the fact that they are also used for mother’s brother’s grandchild, who was of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s child’s generation, not [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s grandchild’s.


<a id="p-77"></a>

[POc &ast;_tubu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-3-6-77-POc-tubu-a)

NE Ambae and Trevitt’s Tolai also suggest that father’s mother, father’s sister (FZ), FZD, FZDD and so on, i.e. father’s maternal line, were either labelled ‘mother’ or ‘grandparent’ in POc. The evidence for this is less than the set above, but the strength of the ‘mother’ set below (from [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2) is reinforced by the Nduindui and Chuukese glosses, which include both FZD and FZDD. The POc term was presumably the well supported _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’, despite the fact that Lele, Mota and Nduindui all have another term for ‘mother’. The evidence for POc _&ast;tubu-_ in this role is thinner but the glosses are convincing.

[6-2-3-6-77-yap-yapese-citinio](cf.csv#cldf:6-2-3-6-77-yap-yapese-citinio)

In NE Ambae the brother of the father’s lineal female is called _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’, i.e. FMB, F (and FB), FZS, FZDS and FZDDS are all _&ast;tama-_. Again there is respectable evidence for this among the data in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.1

[POc &ast;_tama-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-3-6-77-POc-tama-a)


<a id="p-78"></a>

Collectively, the evidence above is respectable support for the hypothesis that the gaps in the POc tree are there because POc has a stage B. Some of the bracketed terms in [Figure 2](#fig-6-2) are reconstructed not by the comparative method but by local inference. For example, if mother’s brother’s child was labelled _&ast;natu-_, otherwise ‘child’, then mother’s brother’s child’s child was probably labelled _&ast;makubu-_, otherwise ‘grandchild’.

## 4. Reconstructing Proto Oceanic kinship terms


In this section POc terms are presented with supporting evidence. Among other things, we were interested in ascertaining whether a reconstructed term was a POc innovation or an inheritance from an earlier Austronesian interstage. As in other chapters of these volumes, we often rely on others’ reconstructions of PAn, PMP or PEMP terms as evidence of inheritance. Where a relevant reconstruction has not been made, however, we have explored SHWNG languages to see whether a term is reconstructable to PEMP—and therefore inherited into POc—and have cited relevant SHWNG data. SHWNG languages fall into four subgroups: South Halmahera (SH), Raja Ampat (RA), Bomberai (Bom) and Cenderawasih Bay (CB).

Some PPn kin terms are shown with two forms, like _&ast;tina-_ and _&ast;tinana_ ‘mother’ ([Pawley 1967](Source#cldf:Pawley1967):262–263; [Wilson 1982](Source#cldf:Wilson1982):35–60, 96-99). The first term of the pair, like other items ending in a hyphen, retained POc direct possession of kin terms whereby the possessor suffix was added directly to the stem ([vol.1:32](ContributionTable?anchor=p-32#cldf:1-2); [vol.5:75](ContributionTable?anchor=p-75#cldf:5-3)–76), but this occurred only with a singular possessor.[^22] With a non-singular possessor and optionally with a singular possessor an indirect possession construction was used, e.g. PPn _&ast;t-o-tā tama-na_ [ART-PCL-P:1PL father-P:3SG] ‘our father’ ([Wilson 1982](Source#cldf:Wilson1982):97). In the indirect construction the possessed noun retained a fossil reflex of the POc _&ast;-ña_ P:3SG, giving the second term of the pair.

There are several pitfalls associated with the glossing of kinship terms. At one end of the continuum, a term is glossed with a single term, e.g. ‘father’, yet, given that Oceanic kinship terminologies are classificatory, it is almost certain that a ‘father’ term has wider reference that includes ‘father’s brother’ and ‘mother’s sister’s husband’. However, defining the ‘father’ term as denoting F, FB and MZH in many cases does not cover the term’s actual denotation, which may well be potentially boundless (see [§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2)). A few publications, e.g. [Fingleton](Source#cldf:Fingleton1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Fingleton1986)) on Tolai, offer definitions of this kind. The usual ethnographic gloss, however, is a long string of relatives, like [Elbert & Monberg’s](Source#cldf:ElbertandMonberg1965) ([1965](Source#cldf:ElbertandMonberg1965):13) gloss of Rennellese _tama-_/_tamana_: F, FB, FZH, FFBDH, FFBS, FMZS, MH, FMZDH, MZH, MMZDH, HF, WF. A string of this kind is sometimes difficult to interpret, as it omits a relationship that is implied if the term denotes a boundless class. Does this mean that the authors have omitted a possible gloss? We cannot tell, as ethnographers do not always explicate the structure of the kinship system, but instead focus on the behaviours of various kin towards each other. In any case, the interpretation of a gloss list like the one for Rennellese ‘father’ is dependent on an understanding of the structure of the kinship system.

Often when the long-list glosses in a cognate set are compared, we find that perhaps only the first three items on the list agree across cognates. Beyond these it is impossible to draw any conclusion about the larger category denoted by the reconstruction.

In light of these considerations and to save space, long lists of glosses are generally not given in the definitions below. These can sometimes be found in the ethnographies listed in the appendix to this chapter. Instead, we restrict ourselves to the most straightforward glosses, like ‘father, father’s brother,’ FZH. In the interests of readability the first gloss (or two) is given in plain English and subsequent glosses as abbreviations. On occasion, a definition of the whole category is provided, like the one above (‘Father or any male blood relative…’).

To avoid too much clutter in the cognate sets below, we have not given the source of most cognates. As with other chapters and volumes, the lexical source(s) for most languages are listed in Appendix A. The present chapter also draws on the ethnographic sources listed at the end of the chapter. The source of a cognate is given only where (a) we have consulted two or more works for that language; (b) the source is itself a comparative work dealing with a number of languages; or (c) only one item in the chapter is drawn from that source.

In some Oceanic languages, there are two terms for the same [ALTER]{.smallcaps}, a reference term used in talking about that [ALTER]{.smallcaps}, e.g. ‘my father’ or ‘your child’, and an address (or vocative) term used to indicate whom one is talking to, e.g. ‘Dad, may I go outside?’ Address terms are marked with the abbreviation ADDR. However, there are languages in which this distinction is not made, i.e. one says, ‘My father, may I go outside?’ Diachronically, it is quite common to find a reference term that reflects an early address term.

‘y’ means ‘yes, there are reflexes of the item at the head of the column’.


<a id="p-81"></a>

POc forms denoting certain close blood relatives appear to form a (defective) paradigm, shown in [Table 2.12](#table-2.12). The distribution of their reflexes across Oceanic subgroups is shown in [Table 2.13](#table-2.13). The most widely reflected forms are those with _&ast;t-_ (column 2 of [Table 2.12](#table-2.12)). They were evidently reference forms and usually took a possessor suffix ([§2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:6-2)). The forms in column 4 were address forms, apart from _&ast;kaka_, which has a long history as both an address and a reference form. In some Oceanic languages reflexes of the other items in column 4 are also reference forms, and it is quite likely that this extension of function had already begun in POc. However, it is impossible to identify a functional difference between the forms in column 2 and the less widely reflected forms in column 1 or the rarely reflected forms in column 3 ([Table 2.13](#table-2.13)).[^23]

The relationships among the forms in [Table 2.12](#table-2.12) are obvious, but gaps and irregularities, absences of functional contrasts between forms, and three rows of ‘grandparent/grandchild’ forms instead of one all suggest that this is not entirely a paradigm in the usual morphological sense, but in part a set of relationships (re)created by analogical innovations.

This hypothesis is reinforced when the POc reconstructions are compared with their PMP ancestors in [Table 2.14](#table-2.14). POc forms in _&ast;k-_ (column 3 of [Table 2.12](#table-2.12)) are missing from [Table 2.14](#table-2.14), because no PMP forms in _&ast;k-_ are reconstructed. The only _&ast;k-_ form for which there is non-Oceanic evidence is _&ast;kama_ ‘father’, and this can be reconstructed only to PEMP.[^24] On the other hand, [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979), ACD) shows that ‘basic’ forms like _&ast;ama_ and _&ast;t-_ forms like _&ast;tama_ did form a paradigm in PMP, resulting from the prefixation of PAn _&ast;ta-_ to basic forms, the latter becoming POc reference terms. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979)) also proposes that PMP created address forms by shifting stress to the final syllable of the basic form. Hence, e.g., PMP _&ast;áma_ (reference) vs _&ast;amá_ (address).[^25] He suggests that this led to initial-vowel loss, giving _&ast;ma_ and reduplicated _&ast;mama_, the PMP address term reflected in Oceanic.

Blust’s reduplication hypothesis certainly appears to explain _&ast;mama_, _&ast;nana_ and _&ast;bubu_, but it doesn’t work for _&ast;kaka_ (and Blust doesn’t suggest that it does). The latter is of PAn antiquity, yet the corresponding reference form _&ast;tuaka_ is apparently a POc innovation, so _&ast;kaka_ cannot be derived from it.

Note: Parentheses indicate that a form is very weakly attested, i.e. 2-3 WMP reflexes in [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995). Bolding indicates that a PAn form can be reconstructed.

- ¹ ACD: Proto Philippine _&ast;nana_ ‘term of address for older female relative’.
- ² _&ast;tampu_ is reconstructed only as far back as PEMP (ACD).
- ³ Under the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) entry for PAn _&ast;Suaji_ is a note thaty irregular reflexes leave open the possibility
that we should reconstruct both _&ast;Suaji_ and _&ast;Saji_’. The reconstructions shown here follow from this.


<a id="p-82"></a>

The origin of _&ast;tuaka_ is puzzling. It consists of _&ast;tua-_ and _&ast;-ka_, and seems to be an analogical creation to fill the previously empty slot in column 2 of [Table 2.12](#table-2.12) with a _&ast;t-_ form. The second element, _&ast;-ka_, is an obvious abbreviation of _&ast;kaka_. The first element, _&ast;tua-_, perhaps already existed. It is reflected in many Oceanic languages with a possessor suffix. Its origin is not clear. [Milke’s](Source#cldf:Milke1958b) ([1958b](Source#cldf:Milke1958b)) reconstruction of _&ast;tuqaka_ with _&ast;-q-_ implies he thought _&ast;tuqa-_ was POc _&ast;tuqa_ ‘old’ ([vol.2:204](ContributionTable?anchor=p-204#cldf:2-7)–205; [vol.5:68](ContributionTable?anchor=p-68#cldf:5-2); see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2). He had toyed with this thought in his 1938 paper, but in 1958b, with more data and better reconstructions, he explicitly denies it in a footnote, but leaves _&ast;-q-_ in place.[^26]

An alternative hypothesis—that _&ast;tuaka_ reflects PMP _&ast;teka_ and its POc continuation _&ast;toka_, both in the ACD—is beset with difficulties. First, PMP _&ast;teka_ is supported by only one non-Oceanic reflex (Bintulu _təka_ ‘elder sibling’) and, as noted in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) entry, no corresponding basic PMP form †_&ast;eka_ can be reconstructed. The [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) lists several reflexes of putative POc _&ast;toka_ (see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2 for data). However, deriving _&ast;tuaka_ from _&ast;toka_ implies an otherwise unknown change _&ast;-o-_ > _-ua-_. As the converse change, _&ast;-ua-_ > _-o-_, vowel coalescence in unstressed syllables, is far more natural, the many apparent reflexes of putative _&ast;toka_ can more economically be explained as reflexes of POc _&ast;tuaka_, and this is how they are treated in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2).

The use of ‘appears to’, ’seems to’ and ‘apparently’ in the foregoing paragraphs indicates that we are dangerously close to speculation, and the evidence points only to probable conclusions. Pages could be spent speculating about matters raised by Tables 2.13 and 2.14, but we restrict ourselves here to just one further question: Why are there apparently three rows for ‘grandparent, grandchild’?

According to the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995), PMP had basic forms with the three vowels _&ast;u-_, _&ast;i-_ and _&ast;a-_ ([Table 2.12](#table-2.12)).[^27] However, the distribution of reflexes of the _&ast;i-_ row reconstructions suggests that the latter are an artefact of the comparative method. There are no known Oceanic reflexes of PMP _&ast;impu_. [Table 2.13](#table-2.13) shows that Oceanic forms apparently reflecting POc _&ast;tibu-_ only occur in subgroups where POc _&ast;tubu-_ is also reflected. This suggests that these forms are actually reflexes of POc _&ast;tubu-_ in which _&ast;-u-_ has become _-i-_ in the unstressed first syllable, e.g. _&ast;tubú-gu_ > _&ast;tibú-gu_ ‘my grandparent’. For this reason, in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.1 POc _&ast;tubu-_ and _&ast;tibu-_ are treated as a single cognate set. We lack the data to comment on non-Oceanic forms, but note that the PMP forms in the _&ast;i-_ row are poorly supported in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995), _&ast;impu_ with two WMP and one CMP reflex and _&ast;timpu_ with one western MP and the Oceanic reflexes mentioned above.

This leaves a contrast between the forms in the _&ast;u-_ row and the _&ast;a-_ row. There is no functional distinction between them, and both are well attested in Oceanic ([Table 2.13](#table-2.13)).

[Table 2.14](#table-2.14) shows that PMP _&ast;bubu_ is of PAn antiquity and had a different labial consonant from the _&ast;-mp-_ of forms in the other columns of the ‘grandparent/grandchild’ rows. However, if Blust’s reduplication hypothesis applies here, it will have generated POc forms indistinguishable from those descended from PMP _&ast;bubu_.

#### 4.1.2. Parent and child generations



##### 4.1.2.1. Father, father’s brother


The three terms for ‘father’ shown in [Table 2.14](#table-2.14), _&ast;tama-_, _&ast;ama_ and _&ast;mama_, are presented first. These are followed by a further term, _&ast;tata_, that is either an address term or derived from one. There are numerous reflexes of an apparent _&ast;papa_ in the data, but it is impossible to determine in many cases whether these are loans from European colonial languages or not, and they are omitted here.

The POc reference term for ‘father’ was _&ast;tama-_. Many glosses reflect the fact that POc kinship terminology was bifurcate merging (see [§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)), i.e. terms for ‘father’ also denoted father’s brothers (FB). A common third gloss is ‘mother’s sister’s husband’ (MZH). In a bifurcate merging terminology a mother’s sister is also a ‘mother’, and the husband of any ‘mother’ is a ‘father’.

[PAn &ast;_ta-amax_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-83-POc-tama-a)


<a id="p-84"></a>


<a id="p-85"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;ama_ ‘father, father’s brother’ are few and restricted to PNGOc. It is only the presence of non-Oceanic reflexes that allows us to reconstruct this term to POc.

[PAn &ast;_amax_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-85-POc-ama-a)

POc _&ast;mama_ either was an address term or was descended from one, as the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) gloss notes. [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)) also thinks that POc _&ast;mama_ was an address term, as it has this function all along the north coast of Papua New Guinea.

It seems that the denotation of _&ast;mama_ changed in Proto New Caledonian to ‘elder s.s. sibling’. Indeed, the change may have been earlier, as this is also its meaning in Neve’ei. This appears to be an extension of seniority status to elder s.s. siblings which also affects _&ast;tata_ below.

[PAn &ast;_mamah_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-85-POc-mama-a)


<a id="p-86"></a>

A more widely distributed POc address term is _&ast;tata_, used for anyone called ‘father’ (F, FB, MZH etc) and by extension for other senior males, primarily elder s.s. siblings and any mother’s brother. In some languages this extension has become entrenched. In Notsi, for example, the term denotes both ‘mother’s brother’ and his reciprocal, ‘♂sister’s child’.

[POc &ast;_tata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-86-POc-tata-a)


<a id="p-87"></a>


##### 4.1.2.2. Mother, mother’s sister


The first four terms below are those shown in Table 2.14: POc _&ast;tina-_, _&ast;ina_, _&ast;kina-_ and _&ast;(ñ,n)ana_. These are followed by two address terms, POc _&ast;nai_ and _&ast;nene_, and finally PPn _&ast;faqe(e)_.

[Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Lynch1996)) provides commentary on the fact that POc _&ast;tina-_ is more frequently replaced by another lexical item than POc _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’. This is especially so in EOc languages.

[PAn &ast;_ta-ina_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-87-POc-tina-a)


<a id="p-88"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;ina_ are somewhat thinly spread, but their distribution indicates that the term was present in POc. It is not clear how this might have differed from _&ast;tina-_.


<a id="p-89"></a>

[PAn &ast;_ina_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-89-POc-ina-a)

Only three Oceanic reflexes of _&ast;kina-_ occur in the available data, but their distribution points to their presence in POc. Again, there is no obvious functional difference from _&ast;tina-_.

[POc &ast;_kina-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-89-POc-kina-a)

[Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)) reconstructs _&ast;(ñ,n)ana_ as an address term. Although few of our examples are explicitly glossed as addressed terms, she is very probably right. Several Fijian and Pn languages reflect _&ast;nau_ ‘mother’, an apparent Proto Central Pacific innovation

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979)) reconstructs a set of PMP address terms in _&ast;-y_, continued as POc _&ast;-i_, whence POc _&ast;inai_. Normally, PMP _&ast;-ay_ becomes POc _&ast;-e_ ([Table 1.4](#table-1.4) in [§1.8.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-8-1#cldf:6-2)), but this is apparently a case where an often-used address term does not undergo a regular phonological change (cf [de Carvalho 2020](Source#cldf:deCarvalho2020)).

<a id="p-91"></a>

In a number of forms in the _&ast;tina-_ and _&ast;(ñ,n)ana_ cognate sets above the term for ‘mother’ is preceded by a proclitic or prefix that reflects putative POc _&ast;drV-_ ([Lynch 1996](Source#cldf:Lynch1996)).[^28] These forms are repeated together below. In Lavongai and Tigak, at least, this morpheme is still productive, and precedes any noun that denotes a mother, e.g. Lavongai _ri təsi-m_ [HON parallel.sibling-P:2SG] ‘your sister’ (speaker is female, and her sister is a mother) ([Fast 1990](Source#cldf:Fast1990)). [Beaumont](Source#cldf:Beaumont1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Beaumont1979)) shows that Tigak _ri-_ also precedes a mother’s proper name. Fast and Beaumont both gloss it as a prefix denoting respect for a mother. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Lynch1996)) notes, on the other hand, that the SV reflexes are only found on the noun ‘mother’.

[6-2-4-1-91-adm-pak-hirino](cf.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-91-adm-pak-hirino)

Reflexes of this same morpheme are also in north Vanuatu, prefixed to other terms referring to a mother.

[6-2-4-1-91-ncv-mota-raveve](cf.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-91-ncv-mota-raveve)

Presumably the three last examples, from the Lombaha and Lolovoli dialects of NE Ambae and from Raga, use reflexes of POc _&ast;taci-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’ originally made reference to a mother’s sibling.

In a number of Pn languages _&ast;tina-_ is replaced by a reflex of PPn _&ast;faqe(e)_. The second list of terms below, extracted from POLLEX, suggests that it may derived from PPn _&ast;faqele_ ‘woman who is pregnant or has recently given birth’.

##### 4.1.2.3. Parent


As far as we can tell, POc did not have a dedicated term for ‘parent’. PPn _&ast;matuqa_ meant ‘parent’ but, as a number of the glosses below show, it also retained its earlier sense ‘old, mature (of a person)’ ([vol.4:68](ContributionTable?anchor=p-68#cldf:4-2)). There is just one clue that reflexes of _&ast;matuqa_ may have meant ‘parent’ earlier than PPn. This is Gapapaiwa (PT) _&ast;madua_ ‘mother’.

Further below are reflexes of the distinct PPn form _&ast;mātuqa_ ‘parents’.

[PPn &ast;_matuqa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-92-PPn-matuqa-a)

PPn _&ast;mātuqa_ ‘parents’ was the plural form of _&ast;matuqa_ ‘parent’, as widespread reflexes demonstrate. In some languages &ast;mātuqa has lost the plural feature and become ‘parent[s]’, presumably to distinguish the ‘parent’ meaning from other meanings of _&ast;matuqa_: Tuvalu and Nukuoro ‘old’, Rennellese ‘husband’.

<a id="p-93"></a>

EPn languages have replaced dedicated terms for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ with a reflex of POc _&ast;matuqa_ plus a term meaning ‘male’ or ‘female’, as shown here.

##### 4.1.2.4. Parent’s sibling


A number of apparent reflexes of PEMP/POc _&ast;kaka_ ‘elder s.s. sibling (ADDR)’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2) are used of a father’s or mother’s sibling. It is not clear whether there was a PEMP or POc term with this meaning, or whether an extension of the term to a parent’s sibling occurred independently in various languages.

Curiously, no SHWNG language reflects _&ast;kaka_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’, but both _&ast;kaka_ terms are reflected in Oceanic languages, although not in the same language.

The listing of definitions of the Kwamera term below from [Lindstrom](Source#cldf:Lindstrom1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Lindstrom1981)) has been somewhat abbreviated. [Lindstrom](Source#cldf:Lindstrom1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Lindstrom1986)) defines it as ‘person of first ascending generation, opposite marital moiety: uncle, aunt’.

<a id="p-94"></a>


##### 4.1.2.5. Mother’s brother


Because the role of the mother’s eldest living brother is an important one in many matrilineal Oceanic-speaking communities ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:6-2)), and sometimes in communities that are no longer matrilineal, there is often a dedicated term for ‘mother’s brother’ (MB). Sometimes this term is also used for ♂sister’s son (♂ZS) or ♂sister’s child (♂ZC). That is, the term is used reciprocally.

Sometimes, the MB term is the one used by a man of his wife’s father (WF) or by any [EGO]{.smallcaps} of her/his spouse’s father (EF) ([Blust 1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a), [1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)). This seems odd until one recognises that in some communities—and evidently many more in the past—a man’s preferred marriage partner was his female cross-cousin, i.e. his MB’s daughter, so that after marriage his MB was his father-in-law (WF). This is/was the arrangement when cross-cousin marriage was asymmetric. In other communities, cross-cousin marriage was symmetric. One of the preferred marriage partners for both a woman or a man was a MB’s child, so after marriage the MB was also the father-in-law (EF).

On occasion, MB seems to be or to have been grouped with other relations, so that in various locations the term for MB is the same as the term for some other relationship(s). These terms are listed as members of cognate sets in the relevant subsections.

In a number of SE Solomonic languages the term for MB and ♂ZC reflects POc &ast;tubu- ‘grandparent, grandchild’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.1). In Lele (Adm) the _&ast;tubu-_ reflex is used of MB, MF and MMB; in Malalamai (NNG) of MB; and in Drubea (NCal) of MB and EF. Since this term is often used for all members of the grandparent generation, it seems that MB has been promoted by a generation.

In a few languages a reflex of _&ast;tama-_ or _&ast;tata_ ‘father’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.1) is applied to all blood relations of father’s generation, including MB. Instances of _&ast;tama-_ used in this way are Iduna and W Mekeo (both PT) and of _&ast;tata_ Vitu (MM). There are also languages where a _&ast;tata_ reflex specifically denotes MB. In Notsi and Lamusong (MM) it denotes MB and ♂ZC, in Vurës (NCV) MB and FZH.

In Chuukic (Mic) languages, reflexes of POc _&ast;mʷaqane_ ‘♀brother’ have lost the o.s. sibling sense, but are combined with the term for ‘big’ in a compound literally meaning ‘big brother (of female)’ but actually denoting MB ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.3). Ali (NNG) _məne-_, Kwara’ae (SES) _wai_ and Tavuki (Fij) _ŋane_, all ‘mother’s brother’, are also reflexes of _&ast;mʷaqane_, and one may speculate that they too once co-occurred with a term for ‘big’. Conversely the terms for MB in two languages of the New Ireland region, Lavongai lavə and Ramoaaina ləba, both reflect POc _&ast;lapʷat_ ‘big’, and perhaps reflect a similar compound but with loss of the &ast;mʷaqane element.

Although few, there are also MB terms that seem once to have more literally meant ‘brother of mother’. In the Loyalty Islands (NCal) we find Iaai _ma-hiñe-_ and Drehu _mā-θin_, both ‘MB’ ([Ozanne-Rivierre 2000](Source#cldf:OzanneRivierre2000)), where _hiñe-_ and _θin_ respectively mean ‘mother’. PPn _&ast;tuqa-tina_ is presumably derived from POc _&ast;tuqa_ ‘mature, full-grown, ripe, old’ ([vol.5:67](ContributionTable?anchor=p-67#cldf:5-2)–68)[^30] and _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2). Note that PPn _&ast;tuqa-_ here is not the same element as _&ast;tua-_ (< POc _&ast;tuRaŋ_) in PPn o.s. sibling terms ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.3). It is, however, the root of PPn _&ast;ma-tuqa_ below.

<a id="p-95"></a>

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980c) ([1980c](Source#cldf:Blust1980c)) argues that _&ast;matuqa_ was the PMP term for ‘mother’s brother, wife’s father’. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)) extends the definition to include any parent-in-law. The Oceanic evidence for this extension is not substantial. Instead, MM and SES reflexes of POc _&ast;matu(q)a-_ more often reflect the reciprocal extension to ♂ZC. However, as many data are given a simple gloss without an expansion, one cannot put much weight on this fact.

PPn _&ast;matuqa-_ was the term for ‘parent’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.3). Probably this is not derived from POc _&ast;matu(q)a_ ‘mother’s brother’. Rather, both terms ultimately reflect ‘old, mature (of a person)’ ([vol.4:68](ContributionTable?anchor=p-68#cldf:4-2)).

[PMP &ast;_matuqa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-95-POc-matuqa-a)

The term _&ast;wawa_ occurs both as grandparent ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.1) and as MB. The set supporting _&ast;wawa_ ‘MB’ is considerable. Possibly _&ast;wawa_ ‘grandparent’ and _&ast;wawa_ ‘MB’ were homophones with separate origins, rather than one being extended to include the other, as the sets are largely distinct in geographic distribution, and no reflex of _&ast;wawa_ has both senses. Terms consisting of a reduplicated syllable tend to have originated as address terms derived from the final syllable of the reference term. In this case the possible source of _&ast;wawa_ is phonetic rather than phonemic, as _&ast;matua_ was phonetically &ast;[matuwa].

Scattered across PT and MM are reflexes of PWOc _&ast;varis_. Its original meaning was presumably ‘mother’s brother’, which in accordance with cross-cousin marriage simultaneously meant ‘♂father-in-law’. Its reflexes have undergone various restrictions or extensions of meaning.

##### 4.1.2.6. Father’s sister and POc _&ast;aya_


[Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1958b) ([1958b](Source#cldf:Milke1958b)) believed that POc had no term for ‘father’s sister’ (FZ). [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a)) argued that PMP _&ast;aya_ had this meaning, but this attribution is not supported by any non-Oceanic reflex glossed ‘father’s sister’. Chowning rejects PMP _&ast;aya_ in her comment on [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a)), and omits POc _&ast;aya_ ‘father’s sister’ from her list of POc kinship terms in [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)). Blust and Chowning both argue their case on anthropological grounds. The case based on lexical data is presented below and shows that POc _&ast;aya_ seems to have been a respect term mainly denoting members of the parental generation.

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a), [1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)) has argued that PMP _&ast;aya-_ meant ‘FZ, FZH’. However, he admits that this is less secure than other reconstructions for members of the parental generation, and the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) shows as broad a range of meanings. Reflexes in WMP languages have glosses that include ‘mother’s brother’, ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘aunt’, ‘uncle’ (the last two without further specification). CMP glosses include ‘father’, ‘mother’ and ‘uncle’.[^31] Oceanic reflexes of POc _&ast;aya-_ fall into five groups according to their glosses: father’s sister, mother’s brother, mother, father and grandparent.

Reconstructing more than one homophonous POc term is not an option, as four of the five glosses refer to members of the parents’ generation. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a):216) points out that if cross-cousin marriage were symmetrical and _&ast;aya_ meant FZ, then it would have had the secondary sense ‘spouse’s mother’, but there is no evidence that it did (cf _&ast;matuqa_ ‘MB’ in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.5).

The [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) cites instances from geographically dispersed WMP languages and Kei (CMP) where a reflex of PMP _&ast;aya_ was a respect term, sometimes a term of great respect:

| Dampelas (Sulawesi)    | _aya_  | ‘mother’ (address form)                                                                                       |
| Makassarese (Sulawesi) | _aya_  | ‘mother’ (for persons of high rank), ‘mother’s younger sister’                                                |
| Kei                    | _yai_  | ‘father’ (address form used by small children, and in mourning songs)                                         |

A reasonable hypothesis is that POc _&ast;aya_ too was a respectful address term used of a member of [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s parents’ generation, and that its application has tended to be narrowed in different ways in various regions. This leaves one puzzle: why do none of the reflexes embrace, say, both ‘mother’ and ‘father’, or both FZ and MB?

Several reflexes have accreted _y-_, but this is as expected for a term with initial _&ast;a-_.

#### 4.1.3. Children’s generation



##### 4.1.3.1. Child


The English term _child_ has two distinct senses: an age-cohort sense indicating a young person’s approximate age (‘He is a child’) and a kinship sense indicating a person’s relationship to ego (‘He is my child’). The age-cohort sense is discussed in [vol.5:60](ContributionTable?anchor=p-60#cldf:5-2)–65, along with the POc term _&ast;meRa_ ‘newborn; young person from birth to onset of adulthood’. Although reflexes of _&ast;meRa_ have sometimes become kinship terms, for example, in SES languages, they are not further discussed here.

POc _&ast;natu_ ‘child, offspring’ is widely reflected, as the cognate set below attests. It applied to ego’s children and those of s.s. siblings/parallel cousins, but not to a man’s sister’s child, on which see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).3.2. This appears to leave a gap where a term for woman’s brother’s child is expected, but no dedicated term can be reconstructed.

POc had no dedicated terms for ‘son’ or ‘daughter’. Many Oceanic languages use the term for ‘child’ plus a term for ‘male’ or ‘female’ where specification is needed.

The Loniu and Bipi forms above, with initial _ñ-_, are anomalous (see [Blust 1978b](Source#cldf:Blust1978b):48–51).

There are two variant forms of POc _&ast;natu-_, both probably present in POc. The first is _&ast;qatu_, the other _&ast;tu_. The latter is readily understood as an abbreviation of _&ast;natú-_, with stress falling on penultimate _-u-_ when a possessor affix is added. Its Oceanic reflexes are restricted to WOc.

[PEMP &ast;_qatu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-101-POc-qatu-a)

[PEMP &ast;_tu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-101-POc-tu-a)

The generic PPn term for ‘child’ was _&ast;tama_. Its reflexes in languages outside EPn indicate that more specifically it denoted ‘♀child’, and especially ‘♀son’. This implies a dedicated term for ‘♂son’ or ‘♂child’, and this space was evidently filled by PPn _&ast;fosa_ ‘♂son’ ([Marck 1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996)).

PPn _&ast;tama_ is identical in form to the root of PPn _&ast;tama-_/_&ast;tamana_ ‘father’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.1). Since reciprocal uses of terms are frequent in Oceanic—‘grandparent’/‘grandchild’, ‘mother’s brother’/‘sister’s child’—it is reasonable to suppose that in some immediate ancestor of PPn the reflex of POc &ast;tama came to be used reciprocally, and a distinction arose between suffixed _&ast;tama-_/_&ast;tamana_ ‘father’ and unsuffixed &ast;tama ‘child’.

[PPn &ast;_tama_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-101-PPn-tama-a)


<a id="p-102"></a>

From the kinship term _&ast;tama_ evidently developed the PPn age cohort terms _&ast;tama-qiti_ ‘child’ and _&ast;tama-riki_ ‘children’ ([Marck 1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996)), the second element of each was the reflex of a POc term for ‘small’ ([vol.2:193](ContributionTable?anchor=p-193#cldf:2-7)–194). Additionally PPn innovated the term _&ast;fosa_ ‘♂son’ ([Marck 1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996)).

##### 4.1.3.2. ♂Sister’s child


POc _&ast;[qa]lawa_ has been regularly offered in the literature as the term for ‘♂sister’s child’ (♂ZC). A number of its reflexes are glossed ‘mother’s brother’ (MB), whilst three widely spaced languages—Wogeo, Nakanai and Nauruan—use it reciprocally for both ♂ZC and MB (the Nakanai form is under ‘cf. also’ because it is not a regular reflex). If extended senses were recorded for all reflexes, one could be more confident about the gloss of the POc reconstruction. As things stand, POc _&ast;[qa]lawa_ probably meant ♂ZC, but because ♂ZC/MB was a recognised relationship from very early Oceanic, one cannot be sure whether it already also referred to MB in POc.

<a id="p-103"></a>

Micronesian and Central Pacific languages share a term reflecting a putative POc _&ast;pa(s,c)u_/_&ast;pa(s,c)ua-_ ♂sister’s child—“putative” because there is only one reflex outside Mic and CP languages, and because there is some evidence that the term refers or referred to the relationship between MB and ♂ZC rather than to the person of the ♂ZC ([Douaire-Marsaudon 2015](Source#cldf:DouaireMarsaudonetal2015); [Pauwels 2015](Source#cldf:Pauwels2015)). The items listed under ‘cf. also’ are not cognate with the set above them, but are perhaps the result of borrowing.

Another regional set consists of reflexes of Proto Central Vanuatu _&ast;matailau_ ‘♂sister’s child’. The term appears to break down into _&ast;mata i lau_ ‘eye of the sea’, but this makes no obvious sense.

#### 4.1.4. Grandparent and grandchild generations and beyond



##### 4.1.4.1. Grandparent, grandchild (reciprocal)


The terms reconstructed in this subsection were evidently used reciprocally in POc, as they are in many modern Oceanic languages. Many of them are glossed ‘grandparent, grandchild’ (PP, CC), but others have a narrower definition, e.g. ‘mother’s father’. Here one is again up against the fact that extended senses are often not recorded. It is likely that many more should have been recorded as ‘grandparent, grandchild’. Many ethnographers indicate that these terms apply to all (or almost all) members of the grandparent and grandchild generations, so that a wider definition, ‘kin of the grandparent and grandchild generations’, would in many cases be appropriate. In some languages the definition is wider still, as the term applies to ancestors including grandparents and all their forebears (see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.3).


<a id="p-105"></a>

Members of the grandparent and grandchild generations are not usually differentiated by gender, but sometimes a modifier is added. This seems to be particularly the case in EPn languages, e.g., Hawaiian kupuna kane ‘grandfather, grand-uncle’ vs kupuna wahine ‘grandmother, grand-aunt’, and cognate forms in other EPn languages.

In some languages a grandparent term is used for the mother’s brother, as the glosses indicate. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1980a) ([1980a](Source#cldf:Blust1980a):214–215) sees the association as ‘due to the notion of kin-based sovereignty common to the life-giving clan ancestors (_&ast;ampu_, etc.) and the life-perpetuating wife-giving group (_&ast;ma[n]tuqa_), i.e. a matter of power’.

Terms apparently reflecting POc †_&ast;tibu-_ are also included here (see discussion in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1).

It was noted in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1 that there are also the variants _&ast;ubu-_ and _&ast;kubu-_. The latter has only two reflexes, both _kubu-_ ‘grandparent, grandchild’, in two closely related PT languages, Bwaidoga and Iduna. The former is a little more convincingly attested.

[PMP &ast;_umpu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-107-POc-ubu-a)

In [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2) forms were noted form reflecting POc _&ast;tabu-_ and _&ast;abu_. They do not differ in meaning from _&ast;tubu-_ and _&ast;ubu_, and no known phonological rule accounts for them. The [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) records no reconstruction earlier than PEMP.

[PMP &ast;_ampu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-107-POc-abua-a)


<a id="p-108"></a>

The ancestors of POc _&ast;bubu_ date back to PAn. Historically they have nothing to do with the forms above, but _&ast;bubu_ now fits into the quasi-paradigm of terms for blood relatives described in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1 and in some languages serves as an address term.

Reflexes in languages that have lost final _&ast;-u_ have become &ast;[ᵐbuᵐb] and then lost the final &ast;[b] giving the forms in Wogeo, Ulau-Suain, Sissano and Avava. Other languages reflect an abbreviation of _&ast;bubu_ to _&ast;bu_.

[PAn &ast;_bubu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-108-POc-bubu-a)

As noted in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2 with regard to _&ast;inai_ ‘mother (ADDR)’, [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979)) reconstructs a set of PMP address terms in _&ast;-y_, continued as POc _&ast;-i_. POc _&ast;[bu]bui_ is also one of these, and it too fails to undergo a regular sound change. Normally, PMP _&ast;-uy_ becomes POc _&ast;-i_ ([§1.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-3-4#cldf:6-2).2), but this seems to be another instance of an address term resisting change (cf. [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2).

The reflexes under ‘cf. also’ refer to female kin of the parent generation, and have presumably come to be applied to them as a matter of respect. The _ra-_ of Merei _ra-ᵐbui-_ is a respect prefix used on terms for senior women ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2).

[PMP &ast;_bubu-y_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-109-POc-bubui-a)

POc _&ast;wawa[-]_ ‘grandparent, grandchild’ is of only PEMP antiquity, does not belong to the paradigm in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2) and is homophonous with POc _&ast;wawa_ ‘mother’s brother’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.5). The reduplicated form suggests that it probably originated as an address term.

##### 4.1.4.2. Grandchild (non-reciprocal)


Although a grandchild is often referred to by the reciprocal grandparent/grandchild terms listed in the previous subsection one non-reciprocal term is found, POc _&ast;makubu-_ ‘grandchild’, or more properly ‘kin two generations below ego’. It is not reflected in WOc or SES, but there are reflexes in Admiralties languages, as well as non-Oceanic cognates, listed in the notes beneath the ACD’s entry for PMP _&ast;empu_. These are from three Sulawesi languages: Bare’e _makumpu opu_ ‘great-grandchild’, Dampelas _maʔupu_ ‘grandchild’ and Uma _kumpu_ ‘grandchild’, this last described as a ‘foreshortened form’.


<a id="p-110"></a>

The ACD’s reconstruction is POc _&ast;mo-kobu_, ‘with regressive assimilation of the remaining first syllable vowel’, based on the Pak and Pn forms cited below. There is no doubt that assimilation occurred, but later and separately in the Admiralties and PPn. The cognate set below supports POc _&ast;ma-kubu-_ fairly strongly. This form evidently includes as its stem POc &ast;kubu- ([Table 2.12](#table-2.12)), reflected unprefixed only in the Bwaidoga and Iduna reflexes noted in the previous subsection.[^32]

##### 4.1.4.3. Generations beyond grandparent and grandchild


Just one POc term is reconstructable for an ascending generation beyond the grandparent generation and its reciprocal. This is POc _&ast;bawa[-]_, for which reflexes have been found in only a few languages.

[PEMP &ast;_bawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-110-POc-bawa-a)


<a id="p-111"></a>

There are probably a number of reasons why terms for these relations are not found. One is that in many Oceanic languages reflexes of POc _&ast;tubu-_ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.1) also mean ‘ancestors, descendants’, i.e. not only grandparents and grandchildren but also great-grandparents and great-grandchildren and the generations beyond.

If there were once distinct lexical items for generations beyond PPP and CCC, they have been replaced in various Eastern Oceanic languages by a phrase that allows the precise generation to be stated, as seen in these examples:

[6-2-4-1-111-ses-saa-wauehaarua](cf.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-111-ses-saa-wauehaarua)

The structure consists of the term for ‘grandparent, grandchild’, followed by a multiplicative numeral formed with a prefix reflecting PEOc _&ast;paka-_ ‘causative’ ([§14.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-5-2#cldf:6-2)). As [François](Source#cldf:Francois2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Francois2002)) notes of the Araki form, ‘my great-grandfather’ is labelled ‘my grandfather twice’. A similar strategy occurs in Pn languages, but without the causative morpheme: thus Tongan _kui-ua_, Manihiki-Rakahanga _tupuna tua-rua_, Hawaiian _kupuna kua-lua_, all ‘grandparent [xxx]-two, ‘great-grandparent’, and correspondingly _kui-tolu_, _tupuna tua-teru_, _kupuna kua-kolu_ ‘grandparent [xxx]-three, ‘great-great-grandparent’ ([Marck 1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996):211).

In languages close to the New Guinea mainland, however, it seems that there were terms for distinct generations, but, other than POc _&ast;sese-_ none can be reconstructed beyond a very local level.

[POc &ast;_sese-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-111-POc-sese-a)

[PNNG &ast;_sasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-111-PNNG-sasa-a)

As noted in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.1, a great-grandparent is in scattered languages denoted by the term _&ast;taci-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’.


<a id="p-112"></a>


<a id="s-4-1-5"></a>

#### 4.1.5. Ego’s generation: siblings and cousins



##### 4.1.5.1. Same-sex sibling, younger same-sex sibling


POc _&ast;taci-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’ is reflected throughout Oceanic. It forms a pair with POc _&ast;tua-_, _&ast;tuaka_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2), but _&ast;taci_ is what [Greenberg](Source#cldf:Greenberg1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:Greenberg1980)) and [Hage](Source#cldf:Hage2001b) ([2001b](Source#cldf:Hage2001b)) would call the ‘unmarked’ member of the pair. That is, if a term is needed to denote the category ‘s.s. sibling’, _&ast;taci-_ will be chosen. This also means diachronically that a reflex of _&ast;taci-_ sometimes comes to denote ‘s.s. sibling’, but a reflex of _&ast;tua-_, _&ast;tuaka_ never does.

Occasionally a kinship terminology loses the distinction between s.s. sibling and o.s. sibling but retains the distinction between younger and elder. In this case, the terms for ‘s.s. sibling’ are unmarked, and a reflex of _&ast;taci-_ denotes all younger siblings and a reflex of _&ast;tua-_, _&ast;tuaka_ all elder siblings.[^33]

Because of bifurcate merging ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)) in many languages a reflex of POc _&ast;taci-_ is also used of a s.s. parallel cousin. In some of these languages, e.g. Yabem, the reflex means that it is the cousin who is younger than [EGO]{.smallcaps}. In other languages, e.g. Tongan, it indicates that the cousin’s parent is younger than [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s parent.

Another extended meaning is ‘s.s. sibling’s spouse’, or sometimes ‘younger s.s. sibling’s spouse’, discussed in [§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:6-2).2.

<a id="p-113"></a>

Two further variants are reconstructable, namely POc _&ast;aci_ and _&ast;kaci-_ ( [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1). The former has non-Oceanic reflexes (ACD) but only one known Oceanic reflex, Torau _asi-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling’. POc _&ast;kaci-_ has the reflexes listed below.

[POc &ast;_kaci-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-113-POc-kaci-a)

##### 4.1.5.2. Elder same-sex sibling


As indicated in the overview in [§2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:6-2), POc had three terms for ‘elder s.s. sibling’. POc _&ast;tua-_ was a reference term that took a possessor suffix, and _&ast;tuaka_, perhaps originally an address term, is also reflected as a reference term in many Oceanic languages. Both were POc innovations, as no convincing non-Oceanic cognates have been found. The third term, _&ast;kaka_, was—at least originally—an address term, of PAn antiquity.

It follows from bifurcate merging that the terms below also referred to an elder parallel cousin, but there are also languages (Roro, Neve’ei, Wayan Fijian, Tahitian) in which the ‘elder’ feature belongs not to the cousin but to the cousin’s uncle, i.e. the extended meaning of the term is not {PsG}eC but {PseG}C, ‘father’s elder brother’s child’.

Some previous writers have reconstructed &ast;tuaka as _&ast;tuqaka_ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1). No reflex in our data supports _&ast;-q-_. No reflex attesting to both _&ast;-q-_ and _&ast;-k-_ has been found. Instead, the data reflect _&ast;tua-_ or _&ast;tuaka-_, listed separately below. Many reflexes of _&ast;tuaka-_ show coalescence of _&ast;-ua-_ to _-o-_, giving _toka-_, and a few show deletion of _&ast;-a-_, giving _tuka-_, both probably a result of stress shifting to the right when a possessor suffix was added, e.g. _&ast;tuaká-gu_ ‘my …’, perhaps aided by the tendency for POc roots to be disyllabic.

Why are there two reconstructable forms? A number of Oceanic subgroups have both forms, suggesting that there is/was a functional distinction between them. Several languages have reflexes of both forms, the distinction between them varying from language to language, making it impossible to reconstruct the POc contrast between them.

<a id="p-116"></a>

With the exception of Bugotu _kaka-_, a Maringe loan, Oceanic reflexes of _&ast;kaka_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’ are confined to WOc languages, but _&ast;kaka_ can be safely assigned to POc because it is clearly inherited from PMP without change in meaning.

There is also a small cognate set reflecting _&ast;kaka_ but denoting a parent’s o.s. sibling ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.4). It is not clear how, if at all, this is related to the set below.

[PAn &ast;_kaka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-116-POc-kaka-a)

As [Marck](Source#cldf:Marck1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996):223–226) notes and discusses, there are two competing forms for PPn ‘elder s.s. sibling’: _&ast;tuaka-_, _&ast;tuakana_ (above) and _&ast;toqakete_ (below).The data require the reconstruction of both. PPn _&ast;tuaka-_, _&ast;tuakana_ must be reconstructed on the basis of external evidence, and the innovatory _&ast;toqakete_ on the basis of the reflexes listed below. Their reflexes give us no clue as to why both terms occurred.

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:Clark1980)) notes that in non-Eastern Polynesian languages, reflexes of PPn _&ast;taqokete_ have the meaning ‘elder s.s. sibling’, but in EPn languages, this shifts to ‘s.s. sibling-in-law’, replacing PPn _&ast;maqā_ ([§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:6-2).2).

##### 4.1.5.3. Opposite-sex sibling


The vast majority of Oceanic languages make a distinction between s.s. siblings and o.s. siblings. A language has either one term for all o.s. siblings, or two terms, one for ‘♀brother’ and one for ‘♂sister’. As the tabulation below shows, the s.s. sibling terms described in the previous two subsections make an implicit statement about the referent’s sex, that it is the same as [EGO]{.smallcaps}’s. They may or may not distinguish between younger and older.

|                          | younger/elder?   | female/male?                                              |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| s.s. sibling term        | yes or no        | same as [EGO]{.smallcaps}                                 |
| Type A o.s. sibling term | mostly no        | opposite to [EGO]{.smallcaps}                             |
| Type B o.s. sibling term | no               | opposite to [EGO]{.smallcaps} + [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex |

O.s. sibling terms almost never make a younger/elder distinction. They make an implicit statement about the referent’s sex (Types A and B), and Type B also redundantly specifies [ALTER]{.smallcaps}’s sex explicitly. This has the effect that a female [EGO]{.smallcaps} uses one term for an o.s. sibling, and a male [EGO]{.smallcaps} uses another term.

There is evidence that PMP had Type A o.s. sibling terms, which [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)) reconstructs as _&ast;betaw_ ‘♂sister’, _&ast;ñaRa_ ‘♀brother’. Both terms are reflected in various WMP and CMP languages, but not in EMP (SHWNG and Oceanic). Instead, EMP languages have either Type A terms or they have Type B terms that reflect PMP _&ast;maRuqanay_ ‘male, man, husband’ and _&ast;babinahi_ ‘female, woman, wife’. Their POc reflexes are respectively _&ast;mʷaqane_ and _&ast;papine_ ([vol.5:50](ContributionTable?anchor=p-50#cldf:5-2)–55).

This raises two questions. First, how did this come about? And second, how did POc speakers know whether a term referred to someone’s spouse or to someone’s sibling?

Answering the second question first, PEMP and POc distinguished between direct possession, whereby the possessed noun took a suffix indicating the person and number of the possessor, and indirect possession, where the possessor suffix was attached to a separate classifier morpheme ([Lichtenberk 1985a](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1985a)). Stress shifted one mora to the right when a single- mora suffix was added.[^34] The o.s. sibling terms were directly possessed, the spouse terms indirectly. Hence, for example, POc _&ast;papiné-gu_ ‘my sister’ contrasted with _&ast;ná-gu papíne_ ‘my wife’ (where _&ast;na-_ is a classifier).

<a id="p-118"></a>

Non-EMP data discussed by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Blust1994)) and tabulated below enable us to answer the first question. These are terms which, Blust argues, did not yet exist in PMP but later replaced reflexes of _&ast;betaw_ and _&ast;ñaRa_. Except for Sangir, all the tabulated terms have two elements, the first denoting an o.s. sibling, the second the sex of the referent. In Sangir the first element is missing, i.e. it behaves like POc. Of the second elements, all in the ‘male o.s. sibling’ column reflect PMP _&ast;maRuqanay_, and all except Tae’ and Leti in the ‘female o.s. sibling’ column reflect PMP _&ast;babinahi_.

Blust provides evidence that these two-element terms were treated as compounds. There was no direct/indirect distinction in wMP and some cMP languages, and possession was direct, i.e. by suffix. In Tae’ (S Sulawesi) there is a contrast between the two constructions below, from [van der Veen](Source#cldf:vanderVeen1940) ([1940](Source#cldf:vanderVeen1940):17ff.).

[6-2-4-1-118-1](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-118-1)

Blust, citing [Fischer](Source#cldf:Fischer1957) ([1957](Source#cldf:Fischer1957):5), finds a similar contrast in Kambera between _ana-ŋgu mini_ ‘my son’ and _ana.mini-ŋgu_ ‘my brother’. Because the sibling terms were compounds, the possessor suffix was attached to the second element, which reflected PMP _&ast;maRuqanay_ or _&ast;babinahi_.

It is easy to see that the POc o.s. sibling terms _&ast;mʷaqane-_ and _&ast;papine-_ are cognate with the second element of the terms tabulated above. The first element dropped out, as it had in Sangir, and the suffix remained. The surviving second element was marked as an o.s. sibling term by its possessor suffix and right-shifted stress.

Although many of the reflexes of POc _&ast;papine-_ and _&ast;mʷane-_ below are glossed ‘o.s. sibling’ one can take this to be an extension of their earlier meanings ‘♂sister’ and ‘♀brother’, that is, ‘female o.s. sibling’ and ‘male o.s. sibling’. If ‘o.s. sibling’ were their prior meaning, one would expect a scattering of ‘♂sister’ and ‘♀brother’ in each set, but this is not what is found.

Only in one subgroup, NNG, does there seem to have been a relatively early shift of a reflex _&ast;mʷaqane_ to the generic sense ‘o.s. sibling’.

PPn preposed _&ast;tua-_ to its reflexes of the forms above, giving _&ast;tua-fafine_ and _&ast;tua-ŋaqane_. The _&ast;tua-_ element regularly reflects POc _&ast;tuRaŋ_ ‘friend, companion; relative of ego’s generation’ (pollex; [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.5). Whilst glosses of a few other reflexes of _&ast;tuRaŋ_ mention ‘o.s. sibling’, as many mention ‘s.s. sibling’. It seems that its denotation has narrowed in various ways across languages, including to ‘o.s. sibling’ in PPn.

<a id="p-121"></a>

The Chuukic (Mic) set below appears also to be derived in some way from POc _&ast;mʷaqane-_. At the end of the &ast;mʷaqane- cognate set above several Chuuukic reflexes are listed under ‘cf. also’. These items give some indication of how PChk _&ast;mʷeŋ[ae]ya_ might have arisen. They are compounds consisting of reflexes of POc _&ast;mʷaqane-_/PMic _&ast;mʷāne-_ ‘♀brother’ and PMic _&ast;lapa_ ‘big’, literally ‘big brother of a woman’, here meaning ‘mother’s brother’. This opens up the possibility that PChk _&ast;mʷeŋ[ae]ya_ ‘♀brother’ reflects earlier ‘small brother of a woman’ or ‘true brother of woman’, but the etymology of the latter part of the reconstruction, presumably †_&ast;ŋ[ae]ya_, is unknown.

[PChk &ast;_mʷeŋ&#91;ae&#93;ya_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-121-PChk-meaeya-a)

A distinction was made above between Type B o.s. sibling terms like POc _&ast;papine-_ and _&ast;mʷaqane-_ that distinguish male and female lexically, and Type A o.s. sibling terms that do not make this distinction. There is just one Oceanic Type A term with quite widespread reflexes, and it occurs in two variants, _&ast;lopu-_ and _&ast;lipu-_. Reflexes are listed below. In some cases assignment to one or the other variant is difficult.

The _&ast;lopu-_ set is small and has an odd distribution: New Guinea Oceanic (NNG + PT) and Kosraean (Mic). [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a) ([2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a)) take Kosraean _lɔ_, _lou-_ ‘♂sister’ to reflect POc _&ast;lopu-_. If they are right, then the reconstruction of POc _&ast;lopu-_ is supported. Otherwise it is reconstructable only to PNGOc.

Another small group of possible cognates is given below. Its members are found in Cenderawasih Bay. Unfortunately, knowledge of CB historical phonology is insufficient for us to be certain that these are cognates of POc _&ast;lopu-_. The initial consonant correspondence regularly reflects PEMP _&ast;l-_. The loss of _&ast;-p-_ in Ambai, Wooi and Wandamen is expected. Its loss in Irarutu may be irregular. If these prove to be cognates of putative POc _&ast;lopu-_, then the latter can be reconstructed and so can PEMP _&ast;ləpu-_.

The _&ast;lipu-_ variant below is reconstructable only to PNGOc. Included here are reflexes of the form _lu-_, that have lost the vowel of the initial syllable. These may reflect _&ast;lopu-_. Vitu _livuka_ (under ‘cf. also’) is probably borrowed from a NNG language. It reflects &ast;†_lipuq_: the regular Vitu reflex would be _livu-_.

[Marck](Source#cldf:Marck1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Marck1996)) reconstructs PPn _&ast;kawe_ ‘o.s. sibling’, but there is no Tongic or external evidence for it, unless one accepts as external evidence Bauan and Lau Fijian _&ast;weka_ ‘o.s. sibling’ and posits metathesis. [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Pawley1981)) does not reconstruct this term. Pawley (pers. comm.) points out that its reflexes are restricted to Pn outlier languages, so that even a PNPn reconstruction is insecure.

##### 4.1.5.4. Cousins


No dedicated terms for cousins are reconstructable. As a consequence of bifurcate merging ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:6-2)) parallel cousins are treated as s.s. siblings in most Oceanic languages. Some languages have a dedicated term for ‘cross-cousin’, but the few possible reconstructions take account of the data for very few languages (less than five).


##### 4.1.5.5. Companion, friend, close relative


[Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1968) ([1968](Source#cldf:Milke1968)) glossed PMP _&ast;tuRaŋ_ as ‘companion’. His supporting reflexes not only support this gloss, but also denote a mixed bag of kin relationships, which, as the listing below shows, only grows as one casts the net wider. Whereas it is usually possible to attach an unambiguous gloss to the kinship terms discussed in this chapter, in the case of _&ast;tuRaŋ_ this is impossible.

[PMP &ast;_tuRaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-1-123-POc-tura-a)

Sense can be made of all this by glossing POc _&ast;tuRaŋ_ ‘friend, companion; relative of ego’s generation’. It is reasonable to assume that friendships between relatives of the same generation were normally between relatives for whom friendship was not tabooed, and that these relations varied somewhat among immediately pre-modern communities.

### 4.2. In-laws (affinal kin)


Oceanic languages typically have three in-law categories: spouse, sibling-in-law, and parents- and children-in-law.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. Spouses: wife and husband


POc term _&ast;qasawa-_ ‘spouse’ is one of the more widely reflected POc kinship terms, but it is not reflected in SES languages or in Fiji, where its place is taken by PEOc _&ast;wati-_.

A striking feature of the cognate set supporting _&ast;qasawa-_ is the wide variety of forms to which it has given rise—far more varied than, say, _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’ or &ast;natu- ‘child’.

However, the reasons for this variety are purely phonological. The form _&ast;qasawa-_ had three syllables (four or five when a possessor suffix is added), and has been subject to the Oceanic tendency towards two-syllable roots. The onset consonants of the three syllables are ones that are unstable in Oceanic. Initial _&ast;q-_ is typically either lost, leading sometimes to loss of the first syllable, or is strengthened to _k-_. Intervocalic _&ast;-s-_ easily becomes _-z-_ or _-r-_, or _-h-_ and then disappears; in many NNG languages _&ast;-s-_ has become _-y-_. The syllable _&ast;-wa-_ has often become _-wo-_, or, as in Proto New Caledonian _&ast;-o-_.

[PEOc &ast;_wati_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-126-PEOc-wati-a)

Did POc have terms for ‘wife’ and ‘husband’? Tentatively, yes, POc _&ast;pine_ meant ‘wife’, but the data do not suggest a corresponding ‘husband’ term.

Oceanic languages tend to use reflexes of POc _&ast;papine_ ‘woman, female’ and _&ast;mʷaqane_ ‘man, male’ for ‘wife’ and ‘husband’. These terms are reconstructed in [vol.5(50](ContributionTable?anchor=p-50#cldf:5-2)–55) and discussed in their kinship context in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.3. Nonetheless, Oceanic languages have sometimes innovated terms that render ‘wife’ and ‘woman’ distinct. At least in one instance, this tendency was already manifest earlier than POc. PMP had a number of forms derived from the root _&ast;bahi_. It was perhaps originally a stative verb ‘be female’, as many of its derivations include the infix _&ast;⟨in⟩_, one of several PAn affixes that among other things formed nouns from verbs. In PMP _&ast;b⟨in⟩ahi_ ‘woman, wife’ and _&ast;ba-b⟨in⟩ahi_ ‘female, woman’ are both attested. The latter was ancestral to POc _&ast;papine_ ‘woman, female’. PMP _&ast;b⟨in⟩ahi_ gave rise to PEMP _&ast;b⟨in⟩ai_ and POc _&ast;pine_ ‘woman, wife’, much more sparsely reflected that _&ast;papine_. The difference in usage seems to have been present at least by PEMP. The cognate set supporting PEMP _&ast;b⟨in⟩ai_ and POc _&ast;pine_ is below.

<a id="p-127"></a>

The cognate set below is a further demonstration of a split that has provided separate ‘wife’ terms. The pre-POc origin of POc _&ast;kawe(C)_ ‘woman’ is unknown. Initial _n-_ occurs in a number of languages where initial _&ast;k-_ is regularly lost and accretion of the POc article _&ast;na_ is attested.[^36] Final Proto Buang _&ast;-h_ reflects one of POc _&ast;-k_, _&ast;-q_ and _&ast;-R_. It is possible that there are chance lookalikes in this set, as the medial consonant is problematic. POc _&ast;-w-_ is reconstructed on the basis of Adm, NCV and NCal languages. The NNG, MM and SES items reflect _&ast;-p-_.

The NNG terms mean ‘woman’ and contrast with the terms for ‘wife’ above. In Adm languages and Kokota (MM, Santa Isabel) and in SES languages the terms mean ‘wife’ or ‘spouse’.

#### 4.2.2. Siblings-in-law


The English terms ‘sister-in-law’ and ‘brother-in-law’ are ambiguous. A ‘sister-in-law’ is either one’s spouse’s sister or one’s brother’s wife, and a ‘brother-in-law’ is one’s spouse’s brother or one’s sister’s husband. Terms in Oceanic languages sometimes have the same ambiguity, and are accordingly glossed ‘sister-in-law’ or ‘brother-in-law’. In other instances the gloss is more specific, e.g. ‘spouse’s brother’. Often, though, as with siblings, a term indicates the in-law’s sex relative to ego, i.e. ‘s.s. sibling-in-law’ (♀HZ, ♀BW, ♂WB, ♂ZH; more briefly EsG, GsE) or, less frequently, ‘o.s. sibling-in-law’ (♀HB, ♀ZH, ♂WZ, ♂BW; i.e., EoG, GoE).[^37]

The most widely reflected term for a sibling-in-law is POc _&ast;ipaR_, _&ast;ipa-_, primarily ‘♀sister- in-law’ and more broadly ‘s.s. sibling-in-law’. The two Kimbe reflexes, Bola and Nakanai, regularly reflect POc _&ast;q-_, but there is no other evidence for an initial consonant.

[PMP &ast;_hipaR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-128-POc-ipar-a)


<a id="p-129"></a>

In PPn the term above was replaced by &ast;maqā.

[PPn &ast;_maqā_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-129-PPn-maqa-a)

PPn _&ast;maqā_ was in turn displaced in PEPn by the reflex of PPn _&ast;taqokete_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’, which in EPn languages shifted to ‘s.s. sibling-in-law’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2).

There are seeming gaps in the system of in-law terms. One might expect a specific term for ‘♂brother-in-law’. Oceanic languages often have such a term, but only local reconstructions can be made.

Intriguing is the fact is that there are no NCV reflexes of POc &ast;ipa- and no replacement term is reflected across the archipelago, but there _is_ a possible cognate set for ‘♂ __brother__-in- law’, stretching across north and central Vanuatu. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) reconstructs PNCV _&ast;tauwia_, but [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004d) ([2004d](Source#cldf:Lynch2004d)) divides the set in two, _&ast;taku_ and _&ast;tauwia_, to account for the presence or absence of reflexes of _&ast;-k-_. The division is accepted here, with the rider that, given their similarity of form and identical meaning, the two sets may have a shared history. The form _&ast;tau-wia_ only occurs in Central Vanuatu languages.[^38] It is clearly a compound. The second element is _wia_ ‘good’ ([vol.5:596](ContributionTable?anchor=p-596#cldf:5-11)–597). The first is perhaps reflected in Lewo _i-rau_ and Nguna _tā_, both glossed ‘friend’ ([Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)).

<a id="p-130"></a>

[Proto Central Vanuatu &ast;_tau-wia_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-130-ProtoCentralVanuatu-tauwia-a)

One would also expect a POc term for ‘o.s. sibling-in-law’. A little digging reveals that _&ast;taci-_ ‘(younger) s.s. sibling’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.1) also applied to the spouse of _&ast;taci-_ (sGE). Somewhat counter-intuitively, this means that its secondary sense is ‘__o.s. sibling__-in-law’, also including ego’s spouse’s siblings of the opposite sex to ego (EoG). There are also a few instances of _&ast;tua-_ ‘elder s.s. sibling’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2) used in the same way—’few’ because they only occur in languages that make an age distinction among s.s. siblings. In the listings below, glosses that exemplify ‘o.s. sibling-in-law’ are placed before a semicolon, other glosses after it. Mussau _tasi-_ has only the ‘sibling-in-law’ sense, having lost the ‘sibling’ sense.

Whilst Lou _tio-_ below pairs with _teri-_ above, Kilivila _tua-_ below pairs with nothing above, because Kilivila does not reflect _&ast;taci-_ but has replaced it with _bʷada-_ ‘younger s.s. sibling, younger o.s. sibling’s spouse, ♂wife’s younger sister’.

<a id="s-4-2-3"></a>

#### 4.2.3. Parents- and children-in-law


Many Oceanic languages class parents-in-law and children-in-law together, and terms are used reciprocally. Perhaps because this does not distinguish between generations, languages quite often extend a consanguineal term to include an in-law category. Thus the term for a blood-relative is extended to include the equivalent relative of one’s spouse, so that reflexes of POc _&ast;tama-_ ‘father’ and _&ast;tina-_ ‘mother’ are also used for one’s father-in-law and mother-in-law respectively in Yapese, Manam, Chuukic languages and Rennellese (as are the corresponding terms in many English-speaking communities). Similarly, reflexes of POc _&ast;natu-_ ‘child’ are sometimes used for a child’s spouse, for example in Raga and Chuukese. Reflexes of POc _&ast;ipa-_ ‘s.s. sibling-in-law’ are extended to include other in-law generations in a number of languages along the north coast of New Guinea (perhaps a result of contact). Reflexes of PPn _&ast;matuqa_ ‘parent’ are extended to parent-in-law in Anuta, Tikopia and Tongareva.

Sometimes a language has a single term for ‘mother’s brother’ and ‘♂father-in-law’, due originally to asymmetric cross-cousin marriage ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.5). A more complex example diachronically is found in southern New Caledonia. In Drubea and Kwênyii _tũ̃-_, reflecting POc _&ast;tubu-_ ‘grandparent’ denotes ‘mother’s brother’ and ‘♂father-in-law’. This reflects two extensions. First, _&ast;tubu-_ reflexes were extended in meaning to include MB ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.5). Then the term for MB was extended to EF.

These extensions are found in the midst of reflexes of two terms, POc &ast;rawa- and PEOc _&ast;puŋao-_ ‘parent- or child-in-law’. Reflexes of POc _&ast;rawa-_ are found throughout most of WOc, with just a few popping up in NCV and NCal. Reflexes of _&ast;puŋao-_ are found throughout EOc. Thus reflexes of _&ast;rawa-_ and _&ast;puŋao-_ are almost in complementary distribution.[^39]

There is little doubt that _&ast;rawa-_ was the POc term for ‘parent- or child-in-law’,[^40] both because it has a sprinkling of reflexes in SOc and because there is a CB cognate.

[PEMP &ast;_r(a,e)wa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-131-POc-rawa-a)


<a id="p-132"></a>

The term _&ast;puŋao-_ almost replaced _&ast;rawa-_ in EOc languages, although it is rare in NCV languages. In PPn it split into the expected reflex _&ast;fuŋao-na_, but with its meaning restricted to ‘child-in-law’, and PPn _&ast;fuŋao-ai_ ‘parent-in-law’.

[PPn &ast;_fuŋao-ai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-133-PPn-fuaoai-a)

Neither _&ast;rawa-_ nor _&ast;puŋao-_ is reflected in Adm languages. Instead, the term for ‘parent- or child-in-law’ is _&ast;(ñ,n)ana_, identical in form with the POc address term for ‘mother’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.2). Whether there is a historical connection between the two terms is not clear: this may be a chance resemblance. The gloss ‘parent- or child-in-law’ is shown with a question-mark because none of the reflexes has this range of meaning.

[PAdm &ast;_(ñ,n)ana_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-4-2-133-PAdm-nnana-a)


<a id="p-134"></a>

The fact that neither _&ast;rawa-_ nor _&ast;puŋao-_ has many reflexes in NCV languages was noted above. Instead, there are reflexes of PNCV _&ast;bʷalika_ ‘parent- or child-in-law’. One apparent external cognate is found, To’aba’ita _kʷaliʔa-_, listed under ‘cf.also’ because its gloss, although a kinship term, is quite different from those of its NCV cognates.

## 5. Marriage


There are a number of generalisations about Oceanic marriage that emerge from dictionaries and ethnographies. Early Oceanic societies probably had moieties, and a person was constrained to marry someone from the opposite moiety. Often there was a preference for that person to be a cross-cousin. Sister exchange was also evidently practised. A number of languages have a verb meaning ‘marry out of order’, i.e. marry someone of one’s own moiety or division. If a marriage was deemed proper, then the man’s family would pay a negotiated brideprice for his bride. Many languages have a term for ‘co-wife’, pointing to polygyny.

Reconstructable terms are disappointingly few, perhaps because these matters were referred to by idioms. ‘Shake hands’ and ‘take a woman’ are quite widespread Oceanic idioms for ‘marry’. There are, however, two reconstructable verbs for ‘marry’.

The first of these has POc _&ast;qasawa_ ‘spouse’ as its root (cf [§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:6-2).1). It is evident from  [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995)  data that cognate verbs also occur in a number of non-Oceanic languages. However, the reconstruction is questionable, as it is plausible that such a term was invented on various occasions during the spread of Oceanic languages into the Pacific. Indeed, the Pn terms below retain the PPn suffix _&ast;-na_ which occurred on inalienably possessed kinship nouns.

[POc &ast;_qasawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-2-5-None-134-POc-qasawa-a)


<a id="p-135"></a>

A more probable reconstruction is POc _&ast;laki_ or _&ast;tau-laki_ ‘marry’. Its origin was perhaps PMP _laki_ ‘male, masculine, man’ (ACD), and occasional reflexes (e.g. Tiang (MM) _lek_ ‘husband’) point to POc _&ast;laki_ ‘married man’. However, compound forms like Tolai (MM) _tau-lai_ ‘married person’ (cf _&ast;tau_, vol.5, §2.2.1.1) suggest that POc _&ast;laki_ was a stative verb. Either way, reflexes of both _&ast;laki_ and _&ast;tau-laki_ are widely enough reflected as verbs to allow their POc reconstruction as ‘marry, get married’.

## 6. Conclusion(s)


The kinship terms we reconstruct are summarised in [Table 2.11](#table-2.11) and plotted as a tree diagram in [Figure 2](#fig-6-2) in [§2.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-5#cldf:6-2). The research reported here is founded in large degree on the work of others ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:6-2)), but it is innovative in three respects. First, it is based on a much larger data corpus than previous reconstructions. Second, it modifies the inventory of reconstructed POc kinship terms, adding to and subtracting from the inventory and suggesting resolutions to some disagreements. Third, it examines the structure of the POc kinship terminology in some detail and makes some novel findings.

The inventory of POc terms includes the addition or confirmation of alternative or address terms that [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979)) reconstructs for PMP or [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)) for POc. A summary of these forms is given in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).1. They include POc _&ast;ama_ ‘father, father’s brother’, _&ast;mama_ ‘father, father’s brother (ADDR)’, _&ast;tata_ ‘father, father’s brother, other senior males (ADDR)’, _&ast;ina_ ‘mother, mother’s sister’, _&ast;ñaña_ ‘mother, mother’s sister’, _&ast;nai_ ‘mother (ADDR)’, _&ast;[bu]bui_ ‘grandparent, grandchild’. The multiplication of terms for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ is unsurprising when one considers the number of English expressions for them. Also confirmed are [Milke’s](Source#cldf:Milke1965) ([1965](Source#cldf:Milke1965)) reconstructions of _&ast;wawa_ ‘mother’s brother’ and _&ast;rawa-_ ‘parent- or child-in-law’, which are promoted from PNGOc to POc.

A formal novelty is the replacement of [Milke’s](Source#cldf:Milke1958b) ([1958b](Source#cldf:Milke1958b)) _&ast;tuqaka_ ‘s.s. older sibling’ by two forms, _&ast;tua-_ and _&ast;tuaka-_ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.3). An addition is POc _&ast;bawa[-]_ ‘great-great-grandparent, great-great-grandchild’ ([§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).4.3)

It was originally hoped to provide a history of developments in the structure of Oceanic kinship terminologies from POc through to PPn, but this was abandoned for reasons of space. Instead, [§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:6-2) and its subsections provide a typology of Oceanic terminologies, from which something of their history can be gleaned. The typology situates the POc terminology and its descendants in relation to some of the concerns of kinship theorists. It shows that POc had a bifurcate merging terminology, not surprisingly, given that this structure has been attributed to many of its descendants ([§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2)). Unexpectedly, however, the typology led us to the conclusion that POc was generationally skewed (a ‘Crow’ terminology), or, more probably, that this was a two-state terminology like Dobu or like Fanti of Ghana, with different sets of terms being used for ‘cross’ relations according to circumstances. A fair quantity of data supports the predictions that generational skewing entails ([§2.3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-6#cldf:6-2)).

A major reason for suspecting that POc had a generationally skewed terminology is the difficulty that others before us have had in reconstructing a term for father’s sister, a relationship that is a ‘converse’ of mother’s brother, for which dedicated terms are ubiquitous in Oceanic languages. The improbability that POc _&ast;aya_ meant ‘father’s sister’ is discussed in [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).2.6.

Another term that must also be removed from the POc terminology is _&ast;puŋao-_ ‘parent- or child-in-law’. It has no Admiralties or WOc reflexes and is evidently a PEOc innovation, replacing POc _&ast;rawa-_ ([§2.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-2#cldf:6-2).3).

## Notes

[^1]: We thank James J. Fox for sharing his collection of Oceanic kinship terminologies with us, the late John Lynch for access to Southern Oceanic data and reconstructions, and Raymond Johnston and John Brownie for sharing with us their firsthand knowledge of Nakanai and Mussau kinship respectively. Any errors are, of course, our own.

[^2]: [Marshall](Source#cldf:Marshall1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Marshall1984)) brings together plenty of data, but he reconstructs the history of Oceanic kinship from the structure of terminologies, ignoring kinship terms except as indicators of synchronic structure. Bender, Blust, Chowning, and Clark all mention this flaw in the comments that follow the paper.

[^3]: The data are drawn from [Chowning & Goodenough](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2016) ([2016](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2016)) and were checked by Ray Johnston.

[^4]: On Pn reflexes of direct possession, see [§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:6-2).

[^5]: Many available terminologies, especially older ones, are unfortunately restricted to a male ego.

[^6]: [Kroeber](Source#cldf:Kroeber1909) ([1909](Source#cldf:Kroeber1909)) proposed the original list of attributes, put to use with small modifications in [Murdock’s](Source#cldf:Murdock1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Murdock1949)) monumental survey of kinship terminologies.

[^7]: The term ‘cross-cousin’ was introduced by [Rivers](Source#cldf:Rivers1914) ([1914](Source#cldf:Rivers1914), [vol.1:13](ContributionTable?anchor=p-13#cldf:1-1)), based on [Tylor’s](Source#cldf:Tylor1889) ([1889](Source#cldf:Tylor1889):263) neologism ‘cross-cousin marriage’. The origin of ‘parallel cousin’ is unknown to us. The earliest use we have found is in [Kirchhoff](Source#cldf:Kirchhoff1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Kirchhoff1931)).

[^8]: In conventional notation, FBS, FBD, MZS, MZD.

[^9]: As do the Takia and Waskia of Karkar Island (Ross, fieldnotes), the hill peoples of NE Guadalcanal ([Hogbin 1937](Source#cldf:Hogbin1937):67), the peoples of the northern Vanuatu islands (Torres and Banks Islands, Maewo, Ambae and north Pentecost; [Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):24; [Allen 1964a](Source#cldf:Allen1964a):321), the inhabitants of Tanna (S Vanuatu; [Lindstrom 1981](Source#cldf:Lindstrom1981):37), all Fijians ([Sahlins 1962](Source#cldf:Sahlins1962):154–155), and the Micronesian clans of Ponape, Mokil, Ngatik, and Pingelap, plus some in the Mortlocks and Chuuk ([Riesenberg 1968](Source#cldf:Riesenberg1968):7).

[^10]: The collection of papers in Shapiro (ed., 2018) is devoted to the topic.

[^11]: Lowie’s was a four-way categorisation. The fourth category, ‘bifurcate collateral’, is not found in Oceanic. Lowie’s terms are used here, rather than Iroquois, Crow, Hawaiian etc ([Murdock 1949](Source#cldf:Murdock1949)) and Dravidian ([Lounsbury 1964b](Source#cldf:Lounsbury1964b)), because popular presentations imply that every kinship terminology has one of these structures. However, some terminologies are at best transitional between two types. In any case, Iroquois, Dravidian and Crow are all bifurcate merging. The first two are distinguished by relationships that lie beyond the scope of our diagrams. Crow is the topic of [§2.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-3#cldf:6-2).

[^12]: Sye _etme-_ F and _itviroɣ_ FB display no merger, but _viroɣ_ ‘small’ suggests that _itviroɣ_ once realised a common pattern whereby FB was ‘small father’. The languages that lack (2b) both use a term for ‘child’, Sye _alwo-_, Nadrau _luve-_, for ego’s parallel cousins (Capell & Lester 1945:191; [Crowley 2000](Source#cldf:Crowley2000)).

[^13]: It is possible that Middle Watut also belongs here rather than under ‘Bifurcate merging’: o.s. cross-cousin terms are missing.

[^14]: As shown in [Table 2.5](#table-2.5) some languages extend the terms used for siblings and parallel cousins to cross-cousins, but this is discussed in [§2.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-1#cldf:6-2).

[^15]: The sample has 138 languages rather than 139, as sibling data for Akei are inadequate.

[^16]: They are Sye (SV) and Nakoroka Fijian (config. 3), Patpatar and both Tolai dialects (MM, config. 4), Sobei (SJ, config. 7) and Bukawa (NNG, config 8).

[^17]: The eight languages to which row 9 refers are all from New Caledonia. [Wedoye](Source#cldf:Wedoye1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Wedoye1989)) only gives terminologies for a male speaker, and uses address terms, which are known sometimes to be distributed differently in NCal languages from the corresponding reference terms.

[^18]: The languages are Yabem, Bukawa (NNG), Rivers’ Northwest ‘Guadalcanar’ and To’aba’ita (SES), Ajië (NCal), Tavua and Deuba (Fij), and Marquesan (EPn). It can be assumed that in each case FZ and MB have come (independently) to be perceived as the mirror-images of each other in the kinship system.

[^19]: NE Ambae data are drawn mainly from [Allen](Source#cldf:Allen1964a) ([1964a](Source#cldf:Allen1964a)) and [Lovell](Source#cldf:Lovell1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:Lovell1980)), for the Lobaha and Longana dialects respectively.

[^20]: The languages listed in the table are only those included in the sample. It seems that almost all languages of Malakula have skewed terminologies. Data supporting this generalisation are from Uripiv, Malua Bay, Big Nambas, Larëvat, Neve’ei, Naman, Avava (Niviar dialect), Ninde, Sinesip and Naha’ai. The only Malakula terminology that is not obviously skewed is that of Vao. Skewed systems are also reported by [Fischer](Source#cldf:Fischeretal1966) ([1966](Source#cldf:Fischeretal1966):117-120) in the eastern Carolines, but he offers neither data nor references.

[^21]: The Kilivila cognate _tabu-_ behaves identically.

[^22]: The PPn suffixes were _&ast;-ku_ P:1SG, _&ast;-u_ P:2SG and _&ast;-na_ P:3SG, reflecting POc _&ast;-gu_, _&ast;-mu_ and _&ast;-ña_. Loss of POc _&ast;-m_ in the PPn P:2SG form is irregular. All Pn languages retain PPn _&ast;-na_ P:3SG in the terms under discussion, at least as a fossil. PPn _&ast;-u_ P:2SG is reflected in the Pn Outlier languages Rennellese, Mae, Tikopia, Pileni, Ifira-Mele and W Futunan. The last three also reflect _&ast;-ku_ P:1SG. In vol 5:75 Ross writes, ‘Most Oceanic languages outside Polynesia make a grammatical distinction between directly and indirectly possessed nouns….’ This implies that Pn languages do not make this distinction, but this discussion shows that some do, albeit within narrow bounds.

[^23]: [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979):217–218) notes that the Formosan language Paiwan has _t-_ and _k_-initial nouns, the former treated as proper names (‘Dad’ etc) and the latter as common nouns as in, e.g., ‘your father’.

[^24]: The historical evidence indicates a high probability that _&ast;kaka_ belongs in column 4 of [Table 2.14](#table-2.14), even though it is a form that might also be expected in column 3 (see [§2.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4-1#cldf:6-2).5.2).

[^25]: [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Blust1979)) also reconstructs the PMP variants _&ast;amáŋ_, _&ast;amáq_ and _&ast;amáy_, all ‘father’, as address terms (along with parallel variants for ‘mother’ etc), but these did not survive into Oceanic.

[^26]: Thus we do not know why [Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1958b) ([1958b](Source#cldf:Milke1958b)) reconstructs this term with _&ast;-q-_.

[^27]: It also had forms in _&ast;e-_, not reflected in Oceanic.

[^28]:  The one reflex that does not fit this consonant correspondence is Paamese _la-_, for †_ra-_.

[^29]: Firth has _matūa_. This is an error (A. Pawley, pers. comm.)

[^30]: A less probable source is PPn &ast;tuqa ‘back, outer side’ ([vol.5:86](ContributionTable?anchor=p-86#cldf:5-3)).

[^31]: Limited Formosan data suggest that PAn _&ast;aya_ may have meant ‘mother’.

[^32]: This reinterpretation of the evidence differs from the ACD’s etymology, PMP _&ast;maki-empu_.

[^33]: [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1975) ([1975](Source#cldf:Clark1975)) makes a similar set of observations regarding Polynesian reflexes of the sibling terms.

[^34]: On the reconstruction of POc stress, see [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2000a) ([2000a](Source#cldf:Lynch2000a)).

[^35]: Clark reconstructs _&ast;mʷane_ in keeping with his conventions, but notes that if there is a Namakir reflex (Namakir retains the glottal stop) the reconstruction will be _&ast;mʷaqane_.

[^36]: Of the languages here, _&ast;na-_ accretion is attested in the Admiralties ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):340), in Santa Isabel including Kokota ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):312) and on Malekula including Big Nambas. Attestations of accretion in New Caledonia are not known to us.

[^37]: The notations GsE ‘sibling’s spouse, of same sex as ego’ and oGE ‘o.s. sibling’s spouse’ are equivalent, as are G’E and sGE. Both variants are used here, depending on context.

[^38]: Reflexes of _&ast;taku-_ are found in North Vanuatu languages but overlap with _&ast;tau-wia_ in Malakula.

[^39]: [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Chowning1991)) thought they were complementary, as she did not have access to the NCV and NCal reflexes.

[^40]: Rather than _&ast;puŋao-_ ([Pawley 1981](Source#cldf:Pawley1981)).

[^41]: We thank John Lynch for providing the NCV and SV data.

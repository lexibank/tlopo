## 1. Introduction and background[^1]


The reconstruction of POc numeral terms other than ‘one’ is relatively straightforward, as POc inherited a reconstructable PMP decimal system with single-word terms up to 100. Two related matters contribute to the length of this chapter, however. One is the evident existence of numeral classifiers in POc, intimately involved in the reconstruction of numerals. The other is a search for the reasons why POc numerals and classifiers constituted such an extensive system.

The history of numeral terms since the break-up of POc, especially in Western Oceanic and SOc languages, has been complex, resulting in the loss of some (and in a few languages, all) POc numerals. This history is sketched in Chapter 15.

Recently, traditional numeral systems in many Oceanic languages have been modified or have disappeared because of their speakers’ contact with a European language. The numeral system, writes [Comrie](Source#cldf:Comrie2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Comrie2005)), is more endangered than the language itself. The data presented here were collected either before this modernisation or from older members of the speech community who still remembered them.

Section 14.1.1 introduces numeral classifiers, as they play a role in the reconstruction of numerals. Section 14.1.2 discusses the uses of numerals in early Oceanic communities. The remaining sections are devoted to reconstruction: [§14.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-2#cldf:6-14) to verbs of counting, [§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14) and [§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14) and their subsections to cardinal numerals, [§14.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-5#cldf:6-14) to non-cardinal numerals, and [§14.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6#cldf:6-14) to classifiers.

Both numeral and classifier terms were inherited by POc. Classifiers have been lost or fossilised in many Oceanic languages, but are very much alive in others.

### 1.1. Numeral classifiers and their semantic classes


Grammarians divide English common nouns into two categories. One consists of nouns like _banana_, _chair_ or _mouse_, which can form a plural and be counted: _three bananas_, _two chairs_, _six mice_. These are ‘count’ nouns. The other category contains ‘mass’ nouns, like _hay_, _firewood_ or _water_, so called because they denote an undifferentiated mass of something. On its own a mass noun cannot be counted. Phrases like _two hays_, _three firewoods_ or _six waters_ are odd,[^2] and such nouns are counted using another noun that measures relevant quantities: _two bundles of hay_, _three loads of firewood_, _six glasses of water_. A count noun can also be counted in this way, e.g., _two hands of bananas_, but _bananas_ retains its plural form in this construction.


<a id="p-428"></a>

Nouns like _bundle_, _load_, _glass_ or _hand_ in this construction are conventionally labelled ‘mensural classifiers’, as each denotes a certain measure of the thing(s) denoted by the noun that follows of.

Oceanic languages treat common nouns differently. Generally, no common noun has a distinct plural form, and in certain Oceanic languages, the structure used to say things like _two bundles of hay_ and _three loads of firewood_ is used to count all nouns. Thus for three dogs one says something corresponding to ‘three animals of dog’, and for three men ‘three humans of man’. This introduces a new complication, as ‘animals’ and ‘humans’ are not mensural, but sortal: they categorise into ‘sorts’ ([Lyons 1977](Source#cldf:Lyons1977):463). Indeed, Oceanic classifiers fall into a number of semantic classes, indicated by the bolded words in what follows and exemplified mostly from Woleaian (Mic).

The Woleaian classifier construction is shown in (1) with __sortal__ classifiers. The English classifiers above are nouns, but the Woleaian classifiers are bound forms to which the numeral is prefixed. Oceanic sortal classifiers reflect semantic classes that occur worldwide in languages with numeral classifiers (see [Aikhenvald 2000](Source#cldf:Aikhenvald2000):98; [Senft 1995](Source#cldf:Senft1995):9).

[6-14-1-1-428-29](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-428-29)

Sometimes a sortal classifier has the same form as the noun it classifies, as in (1c), as classifiers are often derived from nouns. [Pe](Source#cldf:Pe1965) ([1965](Source#cldf:Pe1965)) called such classifiers ‘repeaters’, and [Benton](Source#cldf:Benton1968) ([1968](Source#cldf:Benton1968)) introduced the term into Oceanic studies in his study of Chuukese classifiers. Often the ‘repeater’ denotes a larger category than the classified noun. Here the classifier _-faʉ_ denotes a round object, whereas the noun _faʉ_ denotes one or more stones.

Sortal classifiers can also be used like pronouns: in a conversation in which (1b) has appeared, further reference to the four canoes can be made with _fā-faʂ_, where English uses _they_ or perhaps _the four_.

[Bril](Source#cldf:Bril2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:Bril2014):181) provides a nice Nêlêmwa (NCal) example of meaning contrast between two sortal classifiers used with the same noun. In (2a) a living _ʃãlaga_ ‘crab’ is classified as _ā-_ ‘animate’, but in (2b) as _pʷa-_ ‘default inanimate’, the dead crab sold at market.


<a id="p-429"></a>

[6-14-1-1-429-30](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-429-30)

Note that the numeral is suffixed to the classifier in Nêlêmwa, whereas in Woleaian it is prefixed.

Every Oceanic language that has numeral classifiers has a default sortal classifier that is used with inanimate nouns that do not belong to an obvious classifier category or to save the speaker selecting a classifier. In Woleaian this is _-uw_:

[6-14-1-1-429-31](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-429-31)

The classifiers in (4) are __mensural__.

[6-14-1-1-429-32](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-429-32)

A numeral + mensural.classifier combination can also be used without a following noun. Thus _wari-gumʷ_ means ‘8 mouthfuls (of liquid)’, since _-gumʷ_ always quantifies liquid.

A __multiplicative__ classifier itself specifies a numerical quantity. English equivalents are _pair_, _dozen_ and _score_.

[6-14-1-1-429-33](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-429-33)

A multiplicative classifier’s sole function is to be multiplied by the preceding numeral. Thus Woleaian _se-ix_ is 1 × 10; _ʐʉe-ix_ is 2 × 10 (= 20); _seri-ix_ is 3 × 10 (= 30); and so on.

Many Oceanic languages have a classifier type that is both mensural and multiplicative. Hence in (6) _-yaf_ specifies both that classified objects are round and that the bundle contains ten of them (Sohn & Tawerilmang, 1976:170). This is called an __enumerative__ classifier here.

[6-14-1-1-429-34](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-429-34)


<a id="p-430"></a>

Modern Woleaian does not preserve many enumerative classifiers (Sohn 1976:284–285). Languages with more include closely related Chuukese ([Benton 1968](Source#cldf:Benton1968); [Goodenough & Sugita 1980](Source#cldf:GoodenoughandSugita1980)):

[6-14-1-1-430-35](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-430-35)

Woleaian also has __unit-of-time__ classifiers, which form adverbial phrases, as in:

[6-14-1-1-430-36](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-430-36)

Finally, Woleaian has __unit-of-measurement__ classifiers, discussed in [§16.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-1-1#cldf:6-14).

If an Oceanic language uses numeral classifiers, it will have at least mensural classifiers. Enumerative classifiers are also widespread, sortal classifiers somewhat less so, facts discussed in [§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).4. The number of multiplicative classifiers is constrained by the fact that semantically they are a component of the numeral system. Unit-of-time and unit-of-measurement classifiers are rarer because their meanings are more constrained.

Scattered Oceanic languages in Micronesia, the Admiralties and New Caledonia also have a frequentative classifier which forms an adverbial phrase with the same function as reflexes of the POc frequentative prefix _&ast;pa[ka]-_ ([§14.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-5-2#cldf:6-14)).

[6-14-1-1-430-37](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-1-430-37)

The structure of POc phrases using numeral classifiers is taken up in [§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14), their forms in [§14.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6#cldf:6-14).

### 1.2. The decimal system, classifiers and cultural context


The reconstructable forms of the POc decimal system are shown in [Table 14.1](#table-14.1), with crossreferences to the sections that justify the reconstruction. Under A, 2 to 6 are simple (single-morpheme) numerals. Under B and C are the complex numerals for 10s and 100s. No power above a hundred, however, is reconstructable with certainty to POc ([§14.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-6#cldf:6-14)).

The decimal systems of some Micronesian and Polynesian languages famously have multiplicative classifiers for very high powers of ten ([Harrison & Jackson 1984](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984); [Bender & Beller 2006a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a)). Kiribati _te-ea_, Ponapean _rar_, Woleaian _se-piy_, Rennellese _nimo_ and Nukuoro _se-lō_ all mean ‘a million’. The first morpheme of the Kiribati, Woleaian and Nukuoro terms is ‘one’, the second morpheme a multiplicative classifier ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)). Like several other Micronesian languages, Woleaian uses classifiers to count up to 100,000,000 ([Harrison & Jackson 1984](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984)).

[6-14-1-2-431-38](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-2-431-38)

This raises a few questions. Were POc speakers able to count using powers of ten higher than a hundred, or did this ability develop later? And did they use multiplicative classifiers for this purpose? The answer to both questions is almost certainly, ‘Yes,’ causing one to ask in what circumstances these were used.

When a numeral system is eroded by contact, the highest simple numerals are usually replaced first. Outside Micronesia and Polynesia, we still find lexical items for 1,000 and higher powers of 10 in scattered languages whose number systems were recorded before their invasion by a Pacific pidgin or a colonial language. In Lou and Nyindrou (both Adm) the highest simple numeral is 10,000. Motu (PT) counts _daha_ ‘1000’, _ɣerebu_ ‘10,000’, _domaɣa_ ‘100,000’. New Ireland and NW Solomonic languages typically have a term for ‘1000’, Roviana (MM) also for ‘10,000’. Bugotu (SES) boasts _toɣa_ ‘1,000’, _mola_ ‘10,000’, _feferi_ ‘100,000’, _vuðera_ ‘1,000,000’ and _vaðeɣila_ ‘10,000,000’. [Mellow](Source#cldf:Mellow2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:Mellow2014)) and [Healey](Source#cldf:Healey2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Healey2013)) respectively record Owa (SES) and Maskelynes (NCV) numerals up to a million. The presence of these numerals suggests rather strongly that early Oceanic speakers did count as far as perhaps ten million. Yet where simple numerals for powers of ten above 100 can be reconstructed, the reconstructions are almost all limited to a local group of languages (Eastern Admiralty, south New Ireland, Buka/N Bougainville, Choiseul, New Georgia, Santa Isabel, Northern Vanuatu).


<a id="p-432"></a>

The evidence is thus contradictory. POc forms for powers above 100 cannot be reconstructed, but the likelihood that such numerals were used seems considerable. How is this contradiction to be resolved? If, as suggested below, knowledge of these numerals was restricted to high-status older men and their use was limited to certain special occasions ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).1), then there was a real possibility that they were forgotten across the generations and later recreated ([§14.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-6#cldf:6-14)). This would account for the seeming contradiction.

#### 1.2.1. Ceremonial exchange and wealth redistribution


What then were these numerals used for? Apparently to count up the quantities of various gifts, mainly of food, at customary feasts. On ethnographic evidence feasts took two main forms: (i) wealth distribution for the purpose of maintaining or gaining status and (ii) ceremonial exchanges of various kinds. In wealth distributions the feast-giver might be a hereditary chief or, in communities without chieftainship, someone intent on becoming a ‘big man’. These exchanges have atrophied in many Oceanic societies since European contact, but not before they had been described by various linguists and ethnographers. [Crowley](Source#cldf:Crowley2006a) ([2006a](Source#cldf:Crowley2006a):61) mentions the function of Avava (NCV) numerals.

> Higher numerals were traditionally used for counting yams associated with the highly elaborate grade-taking ceremonies for which Malakula is well known in the ethnographic literature, and all of the neighbouring languages appear to have had similarly elaborate counting systems. Preparations for these ceremonies often took years, and it was necessary to keep track of who had provided large numbers of yams over this period.

[Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a) ([1964a](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a):65-66) describes how a Longgu (SES) man holds a status-gaining feast.

> By about three o'clock all the food stood in front of Atana's house. He and his immediate kinsmen had contributed the 250 pounds of dried fish, the 3000 yam cakes, 11 bowls of yam pudding, and 8 pigs. Soon the Longgu villagers, together with some of the residents of the surrounding settlements, began drifting into the hamlet. Nearly everybody brought along some dried fish and a few yam cakes, and several of the leaders sent a pig and a bowl of pudding as well. On the final count the various heaps contained 300 pounds of fish, nearly 5000 yam cakes, 19 bowls of pudding, and 13 pigs.

A parallel situation from northern Malaita is described by [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1939) ([1939](Source#cldf:Hogbin1939)).

In northern Vanuatu, a man climbed the scale of ranks in a similar way. [François](Source#cldf:Francois2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Francois2013):235) writes:

> The way for a man to climb the political scale of _&ast;suᵐbʷe_ involved the public display of considerable wealth. This would take the form, typically, of a number of pigs …. Besides, the candidate had to bring offerings of kava, along with massive quantities of shellmoney …. This shellmoney consisted of small cone shells (Conus sp.) that had been patiently filed into circular discs, then pierced and threaded onto a very long string of beads … The quantity of such money required for some higher ranks could measure up to 10 fathoms in length, and involved considerable work on part of the candidate’s female relatives.


<a id="p-433"></a>

An oft-quoted account of chiefly wealth distribution comes from Elbert’s grammar of the Polynesian language Rennellese ([Elbert 1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):186):

> Much of a chief's life before 1938 (aside from fighting) consisted of fishing and raising fine gardens, and presenting the fruit of the land and of the sea, carefully counted, first to the gods with impressive rituals, and then to relatives and allies. A chief’s prestige was gauged by the size of the offerings he was able to amass; this was an indication of the resources he commanded, his industry, and his personality. The emphasis on carefully counted quantity extended to competitive giving. In [a later section] is a text of a discussion of such a competition in 1937 or 1938, in which 10,000 coconuts and 7,600 banana bunches were collected, offered to the gods, and distributed.

People with counting skills were required at such ceremonies in Polynesia, whether in Rennell, in Hawai’i or in Tonga ([Bender & Beller 2007b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b):228). Counting similarly occurred at Tolai feasts in New Britain, and [Paraide](Source#cldf:Paraide2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Paraide2008)) alludes to today’s near-disappearance of traditional counting.

[Carrier](Source#cldf:Carrier1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Carrier1981):471–474) describes ceremonial exchange on Ponam Island (Admiralties). Every important social event included exchange, usually between in-laws. A man made a gift to an in-law, who later presented a return gift. Descendants of siblings of the donor’s ancestors also contributed (and later the return gift would be distributed among them). The closer the relationship to the donor, the larger the contribution. At an appointed time the gifts amassed by each group of relatives were brought to the donor’s house and laid out on the ground in a formal display that represented the closeness of each group’s relationship to the donor. The donor or his representative then counted the gifts, announcing what was in each pile and in whose name it was given, then the goods were carried to the recipient’s house and placed in a single pile. Formal speeches ensued, then the recipient arranged the gifts to reflect the groups of relatives to whom he would distribute the gifts. He then also counted the gifts, and the ceremony ended.

The ethnographic literature refers to the counting of feast gifts in other Oceanic communities. [Panoff](Source#cldf:Panoff1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Panoff1970):364), writing about the Mengen (NNG) of New Britain, mentions the counting of taro tubers ceremonially brought from the gardens for a feast and of fish formally cooked in earth ovens on festive occasions. [Garde](Source#cldf:Garde2015) ([2015](Source#cldf:Garde2015):126) alludes to the counting of food items at feasts in Sa-speaking communities in Pentecost (NCV). [Bender and Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007a) ([2007a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007a)), summarising research into numeral use in Polynesian societies, comment that “A concern with collecting and redistributing resources was particularly strong in islands with powerful chiefs or kings, such as Tonga or Tahiti…”. [Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970)) describes the counting of coconuts associated with a funerary exchange on Woleai Atoll.[^3]

The distribution of these customs across Oceanic subgroups suggests that they date back to the Lapita culture and that POc speakers counted gifts (mostly food), an effect of which was to maintain the inherited decimal counting system up to high powers of ten.


<a id="p-434"></a>

Did the ability to count huge food gifts facilitate counting and calculation in other areas? The answers here are mixed. Only [Carrier](Source#cldf:Carrier1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Carrier1981)) examines this in any detail, and she finds that skills in mental arithmetic, associated, for example, with card games, are well developed among Ponam speakers. She notes that “Elderly unschooled people keep score mentally as accurately as young people do with pencil and paper” (1981:469). [Smith](Source#cldf:Smith1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Smith1986)), on the other hand, provides an overview of counting practices in Papua New Guinea and concludes that the POc decimal counting system was not a necessary part of gift-giving and exchange. In societies that were most influenced by their Papuan speaking neighbours, number systems atrophied. The Adzera of the upper Markham Valley of mainland New Guinea (NNG) maintained traditional feasting practices, but formal presentations of gift objects and the comparison of one quantity with another were evidently what continued to matter. Smith writes, “Bunches of bananas in Adzera, for example, were not counted prior to distribution, but mounted on a structure reaching the top of a coconut tree.” His case is supported by the fact that the Adzera numeral system consists only of the numerals 1 and 2. Similarly, Duau (PT) speakers, with a base-5-20 system, reckon the amount to be repaid by pile size rather than by counting ([Thune 1978](Source#cldf:Thune1978):74).


<a id="s-1-2-2"></a>

#### 1.2.2. Trade


It is sometimes assumed that trade must have fostered the use of a decimal numeral system, but the evidence for this is ambiguous. [Smith](Source#cldf:Smith1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Smith1986)) points out that traditional trade among Oceanic speakers was an extension of ceremonial exchange. He writes,

> …ever since Malinowski's pioneering work on the kula expeditions of Milne Bay it has been recognised that trade in Melanesia also involves some of these ceremonial features. A great deal of the energy expended in kula shell exchanges, for example, appears to outside observers to have little justification in terms of economic benefit. Thus it might be argued that such overseas expeditions should be regarded not so much as trading ventures as complex social rituals.

He notes, though, that applying this thinking to the trade network of the Vitiaz Strait is controversial. [Harding](Source#cldf:Harding1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Harding1970)) thinks that the ceremonial aspects of trade have been over-emphasised, and that the traders of the Strait, at least, were primarily interested in commerce, acting as middlemen between the Bilbil network centred near present-day Madang and networks that ran along the north and south coasts of New Britain. The Siassi ‘engaged in social rituals of exchange as a means of acquiring valued need serving goods’ (1970:108). Smith writes,

> They acted as middlemen, exchanging goods at favourable rates by manipulating exchange ratios in the different Vitiaz Strait ports. A pig, for example, could be exchanged on Umboi for 5-10 packets of sago, which in turn were exchanged at Sio or Gitua for 50-100 pots. These pots could then be transported to New Britain, where they yielded 5-10 pigs ([Harding 1970](Source#cldf:Harding1970): 139). Thus goods of little value in one community were transported to others where they were in short supply, or had high prestige, usually for ceremonial purposes, and thereby appeared to yield a considerable profit. …


<a id="p-435"></a>

Even in the situation described by [Harding](Source#cldf:Harding1967) ([1967](Source#cldf:Harding1967), [1970](Source#cldf:Harding1970)), the need for a counting system as sophisticated as the POc decimal system would have been minimal. Gift exchange always entailed exchanging an amount of a particular commodity for an equivalent amount of the same commodity. The Siassi traders exchanged a set amount of a one commodity for an ‘equivalent’ amount of another. This did not entail sophisticated calculation skills. Indeed, numeral systems on either side of the Vitiaz Strait are base-5-20 or -5-10-20 systems that have more in common with digit tally systems than with the extensive POc system ([§15.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-4#cldf:6-14)).


<a id="s-1-2-3"></a>

#### 1.2.3. Other uses of counting?


Another pointer to the restricted application of decimal counting is that various ethnographers have observed that Oceanic speakers do not count people or their ages or time in any form.

[Carrier](Source#cldf:Carrier1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Carrier1981):417) writes of Ponam speakers:

> One of the most striking things about Ponams is that they do not count people. Despite obvious skill with numbers, no one has any idea how many people live on the island, how many households there are or how many children are attending the primary school. Even more surprising, many parents of large families do not know how many children they have without stopping to think about it. And almost no one knows that there are 14 clans on the island, although everyone knows their names and can calculate the number in a few moments. Ponams simply are not interested in counting people; apparently these quantifications tell them nothing interesting about social relations. But other sorts of quantifications do, most importantly those used in exchange.

[Thune’s](Source#cldf:Thune1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Thune1978):74) account of numeration among the Duau (PT) of Normanby Island overlaps strikingly with Carrier’s, except that the Duau appear not to use counting even in gift exchanges.

> … mothers of children only a few years old do not know (nor do they care about) the ages of their children. It is not so much that one couldn’t develop means for keeping track of age using the Loboda numerical terminology, or for that matter the introduced English terminology, as there is no interest in doing so. … Loboda people of course are quite able to refer to the age of people: they have terms for infant (_memeyo_), child (_gwama_), adolescent boys and girls (_tubuhau_, _gomwagwehine_), and so forth. But in using these terms to speak of the age of people, they think of a stage or fraction of a person's life rather than of an abstract number of countable years.

[Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970):37) comments on Woleaian (Mic) counting, which is decimal and employed in ceremonial exchanges,

> An individual does not think of his age in terms of years (a unit of measurement of little traditional importance on Woleai) or of seasons (a unit which is important and discussed below), but only comparatively, as being younger or older than some other person of reference. The life span of a person, however, is divided into several “ages” which vary according to sex.

[Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):186) writes,


<a id="p-436"></a>

> Not everything was counted in Rennellese culture. No one knew or was at all interested in his own age. One was content with the vague terms for the life span: infancy (_mi’ime’o’anga_), adolescence (_bagokaa ’anga_), middle age (_mi’itauiku ’anga_), old age (_tauiku_), and extreme old age or senility (_hu’oitouiku_, _neneba_, _tau mago ti’aki_). Years and generations were not counted at all. Time was told by looking at the sky.

[Labrecque](Source#cldf:Labrecque2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Labrecque2009)) comments on Southeast Ambrym speakers:

> If you were to ask someone how many children they have, they would have to name each one and count on their fingers as they think of their children by name, not number. Even in the same conversation, 2 minutes later, if asked to verify that they had 5 children, they would need to start counting all over again. This is the same for number of gardens, pigs, cattle, chickens.

There are overlaps between these mutually distant accounts. They agree that Duau, Woleaian and Renellese speakers do not count ages in years but assign people to age cohorts ([vol.5:57](ContributionTable?anchor=p-57#cldf:5-2)–70). Neither Ponam nor Duau nor SE Ambrym speakers know straight off how many children they have. Rennellese speakers do not count years, and Chapter 11 confirms that this is true all over Oceania.


<a id="s-1-2-4"></a>

#### 1.2.4. The origin of Oceanic enumerative classifiers


Formal counting at feasts was mostly performed with a decimal system, but this was accompanied by the use of enumerative classifiers. That is, each product was arranged or bundled in units that contained a certain number of each product, and it was these units that were counted, rather than the product itself.

[Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):187) describes a wealth distribution 20 years later than the one quoted in [§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).1, by which time the young no longer fully understand the counting practices of their elders:

> In 1958 on Rennell the traditional distributions were to some extent still practiced on great occasions, with the Christian god replacing those of Rennell. The main event of the greatest holiday, New Year’s, was the food distribution. A few elderly men supervised what seemed to the young an impressive but overly fussy way of arranging the huge displays. Why should large fish, reptiles, and humans be counted differently than small fish? Why should yams and breadfruit be counted in pairs, banana bunches in fours, and bunches of taro stalks in fives?

The last two sentences refer to the use of enumerative classifiers in counting. The Rennellese elders counted with enumerative classifiers of different quantities, the quantity depending on the item counted.

[Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Fox1931)) takes the connection between Arosi numerals and feasting for granted when he discusses the term for ten million coconuts: ‘The people say they never needed in practice a larger numeral term, as they never prepared for a feast more than ten million nuts, and so they did not go any further.’

Enumerative classifiers have been recorded in many Oceanic languages (for specifics see [§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14)). [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1930) ([1930](Source#cldf:Ivens1930)) and [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a) ([1964a](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a)), both cited by [Hill & Unger](Source#cldf:HillandUnger2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:HillandUnger2018)), mention large numbers of foodstuffs at ceremonial exchanges. They write,


<a id="p-437"></a>

> A reader of their ethnographic work may wonder how they knew there were 5,000 yam cakes or 20,000 yams, and why it was important to the communities to calculate exactly how many yam cakes or yams there were. There was no written numeration so, once counted, how did speakers remember these numbers?

Hill & Unger’s answer is that SE Solomons languages use enumerative classifiers[^4] ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)) to count items in tens, thereby reducing counting and memorisation (also [Bender & Beller 2007a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007a), [2007b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b)). In (11) _paga_ is an enumerative classifier meaning ‘ten animals’. The structure is an analogue of English ‘a school of fish’, but _school_ specifies no quantity, whereas Lengo _paga_ is a group of ten animals.

[6-14-1-2-437-39](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-1-2-437-39)

But this cannot have been the whole answer to the ‘how’ question. There must have been at least two other ingredients to counting large quantities. First, some enumerative classifiers counted multiples of other enumerative classifiers (§[§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14)–4). Second, people kept tallies by various ethnographically recorded means. These included plucking the leaflets from a fern ([Fox 1931](Source#cldf:Fox1931); [Paraide 2008](Source#cldf:Paraide2008)) or tying knots in a string ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):353). Codrington also describes more complex tallies.

> At Saa when yams are counted two men count out each five, making ten, and as each ten is made they call out ‘one’, ‘two’, and so on. A man sits by, and when ‘ten’ is called making a hundred, he puts down a little yam for a tally.

[Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a) ([2006a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a), [2007b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b)) argue convincingly that enumerative classifiers count products that are both culturally salient and abundant ([§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14)). Cultural salience here means that the counted products are considered worthy of ceremonial exchange or as representative of the donor’s distributions. This suggests in turn that enumerative classifiers arose from nouns that designated the smallest collection units in which products were laid out at these ceremonies. However, no POc enumerative classifier can be securely reconstructed, and the evidence for this hypothesis consists of the circumstantial evidence offered in the subsections of [§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14). It includes the fact that the items counted with an enumerative classifier are the items that are presented in ceremonial exchanges and that the classifiers themselves participated in classifier hierarchies where each classifier denoted a multiple of a numeral associated with the counted product. The numeral was often two, i.e. a pair.

<a id="map-6-14_1"> </a>

[__Map 14.1:__ Distribution of classifiers by semantic type](MediaTable#cldf:map-6-14_1)




<a id="p-439"></a>

This account of the emergence of enumerative classifiers receives support from their geographic distribution. [Map 14.1](#map-6-14_1) shows the distribution of the types of classifiers ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)) across Oceanic languages (whether they are bound or free forms is disregarded). Mensural classifiers are omitted because they occur in all languages. Much of Polynesia is omitted because of its huge extent. The maps are based on the numbers of classifiers recorded in what are probably fairly complete listings in the literature, but it is likely that some classifiers have disappeared in the recent past. What are of interest, then, are languages where larger number of classifiers appear than elsewhere. Sortal classifiers occur in larger numbers than elsewhere in Micronesian and in some Admiralties (Seimat, Ponam) and Papuan Tip (Kilivila, Muyuw and Sudest) languages. Multiplicative classifiers occur in relatively larger quantities in Micronesian languages ([Harrison & Jackson 1984](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984)). Strikingly, however, enumerative classifiers occur more widely in [Map 14.1](#map-6-14_1) than either sortal or multiplicative classifiers. They occur in languages of New Ireland, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, which largely lack grammaticalised sortal or multiplicative classifiers, and they are more common than sortal classifiers in Bauan Fijian, Tongan and Samoan—but less common in Micronesian and Admiralties languages.

This difference in distribution between sortal and enumerative classifiers reflects a difference in history. A core set of sortal classifiers is of POc—and earlier—antiquity ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)), but there is little evidence of POc enumerative classifiers. This does not mean that they did not occur, but that there has been a continual process of replacement by fresh invention as a result of the ceremonial processes described above. The map shows that they have also been innovated in places where sortal and multiplicative classifiers do not occur, and in Micronesian and Admiralties languages have not been innovated in languages where sortal classifiers are plentiful. The difference in distribution reflects a difference in the cultural contexts of sortal and enumerative classifiers. The former are in everyday use, the latter in ceremonial use.

## 2. Reconstruction: Proto Oceanic terms for ‘count’


The only term meaning ‘to count’ that has non-Oceanic cognates is POc _&ast;i(y)ap_, reflected only in a few North New Guinea and Papuan Tip languages. A possible reason for its disappearance is its form. PMP _&ast;ihap_ became POc _&ast;iap_. In languages where final consonants were lost it became †_&ast;ia_ or just †_&ast;ya_, defying the Oceanic preference for disyllabic roots and becoming ripe for replacement.

[PMP &ast;_ihap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-2-None-439-POc-iap-a)


<a id="p-440"></a>

The most widely attested POc verb meaning ‘count’ is POc _&ast;wase_, but this was just one of its meanings, which included at least ‘distribute (food at a feast), divide up, count out’, carrying an association with feasting and the distribution of ceremonial gifts as well as food, meshing with the context of decimal counting described in [§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14). The primary sense of _&ast;wase_ was almost certainly ‘distribute’, and so the supporting cognate set and discussion of its senses is found in [§13.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-13-5-1#cldf:6-14).

POc _&ast;topoŋ_ (V) ‘measure’ is reconstructed in [§16.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-3#cldf:6-14). It has fewer ‘count’ reflexes than the terms reconstructed here, and those reflexes may well be local extensions from the sense ‘measure.’

The cognate set reflecting POc _&ast;luku_ ‘count’ has a rather unusual distribution. It is given here in the hope that further research will shed light on it. Reflexes have been found only in languages of New Britain’s Gazelle Peninsula and in the Torres and Banks Islands of north Vanuatu. The distribution may reflect later migration from New Britain to Vanuatu ([§15.9.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-9-2#cldf:6-14)).

[POc &ast;_luku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-2-None-440-POc-luku-a)

Three lower-order reconstructions are given below. The first two are PPn reconstructions with similar form and meaning. However, their initial consonants show that they are separate terms. The glosses suggest that _&ast;lau_ was more specifically concerned with reciting a list, including a list of numbers.

Although the Santa Isabel terms listed under ‘cf. also’ bear some formal similarity to reflexes of the verb given in POLLEX as PPn _&ast;tau_ ‘count’, the sound correspondences between the two sets do not permit a reconstruction.[^5]

## 3. The structure of POc phrases containing an attributive numeral



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. The &ast;NUMERAL _ŋa_ CLASSIFIER and _&ast;sa_-CLASSIFIER structures


[Table 14.1](#table-14.1) shows that POc numerals for tens and hundreds, e.g. _&ast;sa=[ŋa] puluq_ ‘10’, _&ast;rua ŋa puluq_ ‘20’, _&ast;tolu ŋa puluq_ ‘30’, had a structure in which the morphemes _&ast;puluq_ ‘10’ and _&ast;Ratus_ ‘100’ appear to be multiplicative classifiers ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)). The numeral is connected to the classifier by the ligature _&ast;ŋa_.[^6] This _&ast;ŋa_ seems to have originally been absent after _&ast;sa-_ ‘one’, a proclitic that was immediately attached to the classifier. The &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ CLF structure and its variant _sa_-CLF are of PMP antiquity, and are reflected as far down the Oceanic tree as Polynesian. This raises the question, Did the POc structure reflect a productive numeral classifier structure, or was it just a fossil?

Being productive would mean that the structure was also used with other classifiers—and it was, according to evidence from both higher and lower nodes of the Austronesian tree. [Table 14.2](#table-14.2) shows forms for 1–3, 10–30 and 100–300 in one western and three central Malayo-Polynesian languages (i.e. languages at higher nodes; see figure 1.2) and POc. Certain facts are obvious. Cognates of POc _&ast;sa=[ŋa] puluq_ ‘10’ and _&ast;sa=[ŋa] Ratus_ ‘100’ are preceded by a proclitic that is cognate with POc _&ast;sa=_ ‘one’. In Javanese _sa_ ‘1’ is not followed by a ligature cognate with _&ast;ŋa_, but the ligature occurs after 2 and 3. In the other three languages the ligature has been generalised to occur with ‘one’ as well. In Javanese _&ast;ŋa_ is reflected as _-ŋ_ on simple numerals from 2 upward. In Hawu _&ast;ŋa-puluq_ and _&ast;ŋa-Ratus_ have become _ŋuru_ and _ŋahu_, in Kambera _-ᵐbulu_[^7] and _ŋahu_, and in Kéo _mbudu_ and _ŋasu_. In Kéo the morpheme order is reversed for numerals 2 and above.

¹There were probably several POc forms meaning ‘1’ ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14)).

The critical point here is that in each language other classifiers occur in the same slot as the multiplicative classifiers in [Table 14.2](#table-14.2). Javanese mensural classifiers occur in it: _sa=prapat_ ‘a quarter’, _təlu=ŋ prapat_ ‘three-quarters’; _ro-ŋ taun_ ‘two years’; _pata-ŋ jam_ ‘4 hours’ ([Robson 1992](Source#cldf:Robson1992)). Hawu sortal classifiers occur there: _he=ŋiʔu wawi_ ‘one pig’, _ɗue ŋiʔu wawi_ ‘two pigs’, where _ŋiʔu_ is the classifier for animals ([Walker 1982](Source#cldf:Walker1982)). Kambera has sortal classifiers based on shape. After _ha-_ ‘one’, these do not reflect _&ast;ŋa_, but after ‘2’ or greater, the initial consonant undergoes a change that does reflect _&ast;ŋa_: _ha=puŋu pena_ ‘one pen’ vs _dua mbuŋu pena_ ‘two pens’; _ha=wala kapambal_ ‘one plank’ vs _ha dua mbala kapambal_ ‘two planks’ ([Klamer 2010](Source#cldf:Klamer2010)).[^8] In Kéo the reversal of constituents with 2 and above attested in [Table 14.2](#table-14.2) also occurs with sortal classifiers: _aki ha=ᵑgaʔe_ [man one-[CLF]{.smallcaps}] vs _aki ⁿgaʔe dima_ [man [CLF]{.smallcaps} 5] (_ᵑgaʔe_ ‘human being’) ([Baird 2002](Source#cldf:Baird2002)).

This evidence that &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} occurred in languages at higher nodes than POc only says that POc could have retained the productive structure. The tens and hundreds in [Table 14.1](#table-14.1) could be fossils. However, evidence from Admiralties, Micronesian and Polynesian languages tells us that POc did retain &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} as a productive numeral classifier structure. Admiralties and Micronesian languages have [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps} order, reflecting POc &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps}, but less obviously than in [Table 14.2](#table-14.2).

[Table 14.3](#table-14.3) shows Ponam (Adm) tens, hundreds and a small sample of classifiers.[^9] There are indicators that the items in the table reflect POc &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} ŋa [CLF]{.smallcaps}. First, -ŋuf ‘10’ and -ŋat ‘100’ reflect POc &ast;ŋa puluq and &ast;ŋa Ratus, although &ast;ŋa is not reflected in columns D–G. Ponam (Adm) numerals reflecting POc &ast;ŋa and a sample of classifiers.

Second, the structure of tens and hundreds in columns B and C is identical to that of classifiers in columns D–G. The Ponam situation is reflected across Admiralties subgroups.

Micronesian classifiers are exemplified in [§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14) and are well described in the various grammars of Micronesian languages. The situation resembles that of Admiralties languages. The ligature _&ast;ŋa_ is preserved in PMic _&ast;-ŋawulu_ ‘unit of ten (in counting)’ and PChk _&ast;-ŋa-ratu_ ‘thousand (numeral classifier)’ ([Bender et al. 2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a); cf data in [§14.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-5#cldf:6-14).1). It is not obviously inherited in Micronesian forms with other classifiers, but _&ast;ŋa_ is sometimes reflected in a prenasalisation of the following classifier: see under POc _&ast;-tau_ ‘animate; person’ ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)) and POc _&ast;-pui_ ‘bunch, group’ ([§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14)).

Finally, _&ast;ŋa_ is alive and well in certain Polynesian languages.[Table 14.4](#table-14.4) shows classifiers used in the Tongan reflex of the POc &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure. Column A shows the numerals 1–4. Columns B and C show that the structure of 10–40 and 100-400 is identical to that of the enumerative classifiers in columns D–G. Thus _-fulu_ ‘unit of 10’ and _-au_ ‘unit of 100’ are also multiplicative classifiers. One apparent anomaly is _ho-ŋo-fulu_ ‘10’, which retains the structure of PPn _&ast;ha-ŋa-pulu_ ‘10’ where the other classifiers in the row have replaced _&ast;ha-ŋa-_ with the PPn non-specific article _&ast;te-_.

It would be possible to build a similar table for Samoan or for Rennellese, and each would show the same thing: that PPn _&ast;-fulu_ ‘unit of 10’ ([§14.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-5#cldf:6-14).1) and _&ast;-rau_ ‘unit of 100’ ([§14.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-4#cldf:6-14)) were enumerative classifiers. Together, the Admiralties, Micronesian and Polynesian data show that the POc &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure was productive and that _&ast;-puluq_ and _&ast;-Ratus_ were, and in some languages still are, multiplicative classifiers.

### 3.2. The CLASSIFIER + NUMERAL structure


This, however, is not the whole story. There is evidence that alongside the &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure POc also had a &ast;[CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure. Evidence for this comes from SHWNG languages, Oceanic languages with this structure, and especially Polynesian.

The SHWNG languages Buli ([Maan 1951](Source#cldf:Maan1951):42), Taba ([Bowden 2001](Source#cldf:Bowden2001):242–245), Ambel ([Arnold 2018](Source#cldf:Arnold2018):159–161) and Magey Matbat ([Remijsen 2010](Source#cldf:Remijsen2010):287–290), all have [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} order.[^10] None has a reflex of &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps}. Rongga ([Arka 2008](Source#cldf:Arka2008)) and Waima’a ([Himmelmann 2010](Source#cldf:Himmelmann2010):56), CMP languages of Wallacea and cousins to SHWNG also have a [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure. But as shown in [§14.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3-1#cldf:6-14) not all CMP languages have [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps}. Some reflect &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} This implies that the [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure was innovated somewhere in the CEMP linkage and was inherited into POc. The origin of [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} seems straightforward. As most prefixed classifiers reflect earlier nouns ([§14.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6#cldf:6-14)), [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} reflects the regular noun-phrase order noun [NML]{.smallcaps}.

For classifiers other than ‘unit of 10’ and ‘unit of 100’ non-Polynesian Oceanic languages retain either [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} or [NML]{.smallcaps} [_&ast;ŋa_] [CLF]{.smallcaps}, but not both. The classifier precedes the numeral in some Papuan Tip[^11] a few Meso-Melanesian,[^12] and all New Caledonian languages. This distribution is strikingly areal, as [Map 14.2](#map-6-14_2) shows. In the north a classifier follows the numeral. In the south it precedes it.

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Blust2013):284–285) briefly discusses ‘onset runs’ in numerals. These are runs of numerals that begin with the same segment or syllable. He includes Buma (TM) _tilu_ ‘2’, _tete_ ‘3’, _teva_ ‘4’, _tili_ ‘5’, _tuo_ ‘6’, _tibi_ ‘7’, _tua_ ‘8’, _tudi_ ‘9’ and Mwotlap (NCV) _voyo_ ‘2’, _vetel_ ‘3’, _vevɛt_ ‘4’. He comments that they result from prefixation of unknown morphemes. In these two cases it seems likely that they reflect prefixation of a no longer productive classifier: _&ast;tau-_ ‘human being’ in Buma, and the default classifier _&ast;pua-_ in Mwotlap ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)). Fossilised prefixes on simple numerals are rife in the southern prefixing area, stretching from New Ireland in the north to the southernmost languages of Vanuatu ([Map 14.2](#map-6-14_2)).


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. A conclusion


On this evidence it is difficult to avoid the untidy conclusion that POc retained both the &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} [_ŋa_] [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure and the &ast;[CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure, and that various languages either (i) generalised [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps}, but usually retained [NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} in counting tens and hundreds; or (ii) generalised [NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps}; or (iii) lost numeral classifiers altogether.

Some Polynesian languages are striking in that they retain both structures. In this respect they form a relic area which supports the claim that POc also had both structures. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) reconstructs both structures for PPn, and an inspection of Tongan, Samoan and Rennellese data confirms this.[^13] It evidently continued the POc situation. Unlike Admiralties and Micronesian, where all counting is done with a classifier, PPn classifiers were only used to count certain nouns associated with what [Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):192) terms “planting, fishing, and ostentatious display”. If a classifier was used with a numeral to express a number less than 10, then [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} order was used. For example, PPn _&ast;toka-_ ‘human’ ([Clark 1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999):198) was used to count people up to 9, e.g. _&ast;toka-rua_ ‘two (people)’. For quantities of 10 and above, either structure might be used, depending on what one was counting. Exactly how this division of labour worked in PPn is unclear, as languages of the two first-order Polynesian groups, Tongic and Nuclear Polynesian, do not always agree. But one thing is clear: when PPn used the [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure, the classifier was always enumerative ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)), denoting a multiple of the thing counted.

## 4. Reconstructing cardinal numerals: serial, attributive, and predicative


Cardinal numerals (‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’ etc) are reconstructed in [§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14)–14.4.4. They are used in two ways. In __serial__ counting, the speaker says the numbers one after the other in sequence. When a numeral is used for quantification it is either __attributive__ or __predicative__. An attributive numeral forms part of a noun phrase (e.g. two houses, twelve pigs). A predicative numeral is a predicate, as in _We are two_ in the sense ‘There are two of us’.

It seems probable that POc serial counting was done with plain root forms, as in Mussau and in Micronesian languages. In their quantifying function POc simple decimal numerals above ‘one’ seem to have functioned both attributively and predicatively. From the perspective of POc grammar, this is uncontroversial. POc had very few adjectives ([Ross 1998a](Source#cldf:Ross1998a)), and most properties were encoded as verbs, simply appearing unaffixed when attributive. However, it seems that POc attributive numerals either formed a class of their own or were a quantifier subclass, as they took the prefix _&ast;ka-_ when they occurred attributively, as in (12), and perhaps occurred before the noun they quantified.

[6-14-4-None-446-40](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-4-None-446-40)

In the cognate set below, most reflexes of _&ast;ka-_ are fossilised, i.e. they occur as part of the cardinal numeral regardless of its function. There are many languages where _&ast;ka-_ is reflected as the first element only of ‘one’. These instances are excluded here, as they appear to reflect a distinct but homophonous morpheme participating in some of the many forms for ‘one’ either alone or as their first syllable ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14)).

[POc &ast;_ka-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-None-446-POc-ka-a)


<a id="p-447"></a>

[Blust’s](Source#cldf:Blust2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:Blust2013):284–285) discussion of ‘onset runs’ was mentioned in [§14.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3-2#cldf:6-14). One of the runs Blust cites is Neve’ei (NCV) _iru_ ‘2’, _itl_ ‘3’, _ifah_ ‘4’, _ilim_ ‘5’. The _i-_ prefix is a realis 3SG subject marker. In neighbouring Neverver the paradigm is ([Barbour 2012](Source#cldf:Barbour2012):157):

13)

|     | REALIS   | IRREALIS   |
|----:|:---------|:-----------|
|   2 | _i-ru_   | _ib-ru_    |
|   3 | _i-tl_   | _ibi-tl_   |
|   4 | _i-vas_  | _iʙ-was_   |
|   5 | _i-lim_  | _ib-lim_   |

The fact that there is a realis/irrealis contrast shows (a) that these numerals are (stative) verbs; and (b) that syntactically they are the predicates of relative clauses rather than attributives. The phrase in (14) is more literally translated as ‘small bows of theirs that are two’:

[6-14-4-None-447-41](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-4-None-447-41)

In a number of Oceanic languages predicative numerals with realis prefixes have been reanalysed as attributives, with fossilised _i-_, _e-_ or (in SW Santo) _mo-_.


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. One


Oceanic languages display a plethora of forms for ‘one’. This is an exception to the claim that, across language families, numerals 1 to 5 are slow to change relative to both other numerals and to basic lexicon (Pagel, Atkinson & Meade 2007; [Pagel & Meade 2018](Source#cldf:PagelandMeade2018)). Previous accounts have tended to gloss over this.

Where a term for ‘one’ is known to be serial or attributive in function, this is shown below. Where a form is glossed ‘a’ or ‘some’ or marked as an indefinite article, this tells us that it is used attributively, but does not necessarily mean that there is a distinct serial form.


<a id="p-448"></a>


<a id="s-4-1-1"></a>

#### 4.1.1. _&ast;sa-_, _&ast;sa_, _&ast;tasa_, _&ast;tasi_ and _&ast;ta_


Some nouns always took a numeral + classifier combination as an attribute, and others took a simple numeral ([§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14)). In the former case, the attribute was _&ast;sa_-[CLF]{.smallcaps}. In the latter case, the attributive marker _&ast;ka-_ ([§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14)) was possibly used, but we cannot be sure that it occurred with ‘one’. POc _&ast;(i)sa_ ‘one’ is also reflected as the PPn indefinite article _&ast;sa_ (ACD), which, with an irregular vowel change, became Proto Nuclear Polynesian _&ast;se_ ([Clark 1976](Source#cldf:Clark1976):50).[^14] Thus POc _&ast;(i)sa_ was attributive, hovering between a numeral and an indefinite article.

PNCV _&ast;sa-wa_ is included under _&ast;(i)sa_ because it seems to be a local development in more northerly areas of Vanuatu. Added _&ast;-wa_, sense unknown (perhaps POc _&ast;pua-_ DEFAULT CLASSIFIER), also occurs in _&ast;tai-wa_, in an overlapping area. N-C Vanuatu terms often reflect further additions.

[PAn &ast;_isa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-1-448-POc-isa-a)


<a id="p-449"></a>

It seems reasonable to associate a serial form _&ast;ta-sa_ with the above.

[POc &ast;_ta-sa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-1-449-POc-tasa-a)

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) takes PNPn _&ast;tasi_ to be an idiosyncratic development from PPn _&ast;tasa_, and these forms are listed below with apparent cognates that may imply POc _&ast;ta-si_.

[6-14-4-1-449-sj-yamna-tes](cf.csv#cldf:6-14-4-1-449-sj-yamna-tes)


<a id="p-450"></a>

It is very probable that the _&ast;ta_ of _&ast;ta-sa_ reflected a PAn indefinite article, the origin of which is briefly discussed in [Lynch et al.](Source#cldf:Lynchetal2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Lynchetal2002):71). This raises the question of how _&ast;sa_ and _&ast;ta_ differed. The one clue is that &ast;sa was a numeral that in some languages was reinterpreted as an indefinite article, whereas the reinterpretation of _&ast;ta_ seemingly moved in the opposite direction. Another possibility is that &ast;sa was a non-specific indefinite article, and _&ast;ta_ specific indefinite (in keeping with its earlier case-marking function).

In many of the forms listed below, the reflex of _&ast;ta_ is followed by one or more apparently monosyllabic morphemes. Some suffixed forms, reflecting PPT _&ast;-mo_, _&ast;-qa_ and _&ast;-moqa_, evidently meant ‘only’. If _&ast;ta_ was indeed the indefinite article, then these forms may have specified that its meaning in this context was ‘one’. With reasonable confidence, final _-n_ or _-na_ is a singular marker reflecting POc _&ast;-ña_, which, suffixed to an attributive adjective, marked a noun phrase as singular.

#### 4.1.2. Constituent monosyllables


In [§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).3 below are listed other widely attested forms for ‘one’. Taken together with the forms reconstructed above, it becomes obvious that across Oceanic ‘one’ is often either one of the monosyllables in (15) or a disyllable made up of two of them. The monosyllables form a pattern.

15)

|       |       |        |
|:------|:------|:-------|
| _&ast;sa_ | _&ast;si_ | _&ast;sai_ |
| _&ast;ta_ | _&ast;ti_ | _&ast;tai_ |
| _&ast;ka_ | —     | _&ast;kai_ |

Of the monosyllables in (15) all but _&ast;si_ occur alone as ‘one’. Initial _&ast;si-_ and _&ast;ti-_ tend to occur in the same combinations as _&ast;sa-_ and _&ast;ta-_, suggesting that at various times and places _&ast;si-_ and _&ast;sa-_ have been in an allomorphic or allophonic relationship, and so have _&ast;ti-_ and _&ast;ta-_. Final _&ast;-si_ occurs only in _&ast;ta-si_, an apparent variant of _&ast;ta-sa_, discussed above. Final _&ast;-ka_ only occurs in contexts in which _&ast;-kai_ also occurs, so they too are treated as one morpheme. This leaves us with the monosyllables in the lefthand column of (16), which also shows the disyllables formed from them. Disyllables that occur only once in the data or only in a small closely knit subgroup are excluded. Bolded forms are those reconstructed in [§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1.

16)

|           |              |          |            |
|:----------|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| ___&ast;sa___ | …            | …        | _&ast;sa-kai_  |
| _&ast;sai_    | _&ast;sai-sa_    | …        | …          |
| ___&ast;ta___ | ___&ast;ta-sa___ | …        | _&ast;ta-kai_  |
| _&ast;tai_    | _&ast;tai-sa_    | …        | …          |
| _&ast;ka_     | …            | _&ast;ka-ti_ | …          |
| _&ast;kai_    | _&ast;kai-sa_    | …        | _&ast;kai-kai_ |

POc disyllables tend to have at most three moras, and out of the nine possible 4-mora forms to which _&ast;sai_, _&ast;tai_ and _&ast;kai_ could give rise, only the reduplicate _&ast;kai-kai_ is putatively attested.

This still gives far more forms for ‘one’ than are expected in a single language. Can this be explained? Several factors may contribute to this situation. One is perhaps that an independent morpheme should have a minimum of two moras. One strategy for achieving this with single-mora reflexes of _&ast;sa_, _&ast;ta_ or _&ast;ka_ is to add a morpheme meaning ‘only’, as noted in [§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1. When two of the monosyllables in (15) join to form a term for ‘one’ in (16), the second was perhaps being used in the sense of ‘only’.


<a id="p-452"></a>

Some reflexes of POc _&ast;sa_ and _&ast;ta_ ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1) also function as indefinite articles. The semantic distinction between attributive ‘one’ and an indefinite specific article is small. In _My sister married a handsome man_, the phrase _a handsome man_ refers to an individual known to the speaker, just as _one person_ does in _Only one person came to my party_. But it is only a short move from here to _My sister wants to marry a handsome man_ or _I’ll meet one boy tonight_, where a and one may refer to a specific individual or to an indefinite member of the class ‘man’/‘boy’. Possibly the semantic links from ‘one’ to a specific article and from there to an indefinite article are enough to bring about the coining of disyllabic forms as a means of disambiguation.

Another explanation lies in marking the serial/attributive distinction ([§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14)). The POc proclitic _&ast;sa-_ ‘one’ was clearly attributive, as it was used with classifiers ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1). The corresponding serial form was perhaps _&ast;ta-sa_. The serial/attributive distinction can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty for two Oceanic subgroups: PSES _&ast;kesa_ ‘one (serial)’ (< _&ast;kai-sa_) vs PSES _&ast;sa-kai_ ‘one (attributive)’, and PMic _&ast;tai-sa_ ‘one (serial)’ vs PMic _&ast;te-_ ‘one (attributive)’ ([Bender et al. 2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a)).

Reconstructing forms that are monosyllables or are constructed from them (see below) is tricky in any event, as there is an increased probability that homophonous forms have different origins. A case in point is initial _&ast;kai-_. It may be the _&ast;kai-_ in (15); or it may reflect the classifier for long rigid objects _&ast;kai-_ ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)).


<a id="s-4-1-3"></a>

#### 4.1.3. Other widely attested forms for ‘one’


This subsection contains forms that are widely enough attested to imply a reconstruction. ‘Widely enough attested’ means that they have reflexes on both sides of the Near/Remote Oceanic boundary ([§1.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-4-4#cldf:6-14).2). The disyllables in (16) are certainly not all of POc antiquity, and it is likely that the same morpheme sequences have been innovated independently in various times and places. They are presented here because organising the data in this way indicates what is there, and suggests future research.


##### 4.1.3.1. _&ast;tai_ and _&ast;tai-_


Forms reflecting &ast;tai are so widespread that this appears to have been a standalone POc form for ‘one’. It is perhaps an extended form of _&ast;ta_ ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1), but the function of added _&ast;-i_ is not known. As mentioned above, there are various local additional syllables.

The morph _&ast;kai_ ‘one’ is fairly widely recorded with and without extensions in Western Oceanic languages: e.g. NNG: Takia _kai-k_; Apalik _ke_; Poeng _ke-na_; PT: Tawala _e-mosi_; Duau _kai-geda_; MM: Tigak _kai_; Babatana _kə-ke_; Roviana _kɛ-ke_ (attributive); Kokota _kaike_ ‘one’ (attributive) (cf. also _&ast;kai-sa_; [§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).3.3).


<a id="p-454"></a>

The two sets immediately below, _&ast;sa-kai_ and _&ast;ta-kai_, appear to be parallel extensions of _&ast;sa_ and _&ast;ta_ ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).1). They are not assigned here to POc, as multiple independent origins are possible.

One of these forms, _&ast;kai-sa_, meets the ‘widely enough attested’ criterion ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14).3). Like _&ast;sakai_ and _&ast;takai_, and for the same reason, it is not assigned to POc.

### 4.2. From two to five


The inherited decimal numerals from 2 to 5 are reflected in so many Oceanic languages that a cognate set of several pages could be mustered for each. Since reconstruction is straightforward, only a sample from each small language group is given in the interests of space.

#### 4.2.1. Two

<a id="p-457"></a>

Formosan data in [Li](Source#cldf:Li2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:Li2006)) show that PAn formed numerals used with human beings by _&ast;Ca-_ reduplication. There are indications that this survived into POc.

#### 4.2.2. Three


Below are reflexes of POc _&ast;tolu_ ‘3’. Motu _ta-toi_ ‘3 (of people)’ appears to reflect POc _&ast;ta-tolu_ (< PAn _&ast;ta-telu_; ACD) ‘3 (of people)’, but there are no other known Oceanic reflexes.

<a id="p-458"></a>


<a id="s-4-2-3"></a>

#### 4.2.3. Four


The numeral for ‘4’, POc _&ast;pat_, reflects the loss of initial PMP _&ast;e-_ [ə-], reducing it to a single syllable. There were very few monosyllabic roots in POc, and this probably explains the emergence of the disyllabic doublet PEMP/POc _&ast;pati_. John Lynch (pers. comm., 8 October 2020) found languages of northwest Malakula where reflexes of both co-occur in revealing contexts. The numerals 2–4 and 7–9 in Tape are as follows:


<a id="p-459"></a>

|             |                  |
|:------------|:-----------------|
| _i-ru_  ‘2’ | _ci-ru_      ‘7’ |
| _i-təl_ ‘3’ | _ci-təl_     ‘8’ |
| _i-ves_ ‘4’ | _ce-vet_     ‘9’ |

When the base-5 system emerged (see ch. 15), Lynch suggests, two forms coexisted: a reflex of _&ast;pati_ and a reflex of _&ast;pat_, conjoined to the ancestor of _ce-_ to form ‘9’, and thus avoiding monosyllabicity. Hence Tape _-ves_ reflects _&ast;pati_ and _-vet_ reflects _&ast;pat_. When the base-5 system was created, _i-_ had not yet been prefixed. It was presumably a 3sg pronominal, reflecting a stage when numerals were verbs ([§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14)). Lynch also draws attention to Big Nambas _-ð̼a_ ‘4’ and _-sa-ð̼et_ ‘9’, with a history similar to that of Tape _-ves_ and _-vet_.

Among the reflexes of _&ast;pat_ below, Mussau, Numbami, Dobu, Vitu and Drehu each regularly add a vowel after a final POc consonant, rendering the reflex disyllabic. Ponam, Tungak, Tabar, Äiwoo, Buma, Sye, Lenakel, Kwamera and Nêlêmwa all add one or more syllables of varying origin. The history of the remaining reflexes of &ast;pat remains a matter of conjecture.

[PAn &ast;_Sepat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-2-459-POc-pat-a)


<a id="p-460"></a>

A number of the reflexes of _&ast;pati_ below reflect the unsurprising fact that at various times and places reflexes of _&ast;pati_ have displaced those of _&ast;pat_.

[PCEMP &ast;_pati_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-2-460-POc-pati-a)

POc _&ast;paŋi_ ‘4’ appears to be a variant of POc _&ast;pati_ above, of unknown etiology. Motu has a reduplicated form _ha-hani_ ‘4, of persons’, formed by analogy with _ra-rua_ ‘2, of persons’ and _ta-tolu_ ‘3, of persons’ above.

<a id="s-4-2-4"></a>

#### 4.2.4. Five


Terms for ‘5’ in Oceanic languages are usually derived from terms for ‘hand, arm’. The most frequently reflected POc term is _&ast;lima_, which meant ‘5; hand, arm’ ([vol.5:160](ContributionTable?anchor=p-160#cldf:5-3)–161). The colexification of the two concepts had survived from PAn and reflects much earlier digit-tallying (probably pre-PAn) than the early Oceanic practice described in [§15.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-2#cldf:6-14). Reflexes of _&ast;lima_ are listed below.

The reflexes listed under _&ast;lima_ are all regular, including those that reflect _&ast;l-_ as _n-_ or zero. The notes in parentheses after the items below show that in some languages the two forms have diverged phonologically.[^15] But some instances of divergence are of another kind. POc also had a variant _&ast;nima_ ‘5; hand, arm’ ([vol.5:160](ContributionTable?anchor=p-160#cldf:5-3)) Its reflexes are listed separately below. It seems, though, that in scattered languages _&ast;lima_ remained as ‘5’, whilst the _&ast;nima_ variant became ‘hand, arm’. See Mussau, Sudest, Tangga and Äiwoo below. The intriguing feature of the divergences is that it is the term ‘hand, arm’ that has changed, not the term for ‘5’, presumably due to homophony avoidance.

[PAn &ast;_lima_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-2-461-POc-lima-a)


<a id="p-462"></a>


<a id="p-463"></a>

The reflexes of _&ast;nima_ below all reflect both senses: ‘5’ and ‘hand, arm’. The North New Guinea items all reflect _&ast;nima_ as ‘hand’ in the context of a digit-tally system (chapter 15), and thus reflect more recent adoptions of _&ast;nima_ as ‘5’. For this reason, POc _&ast;nima_ is not reconstructed with the sense ‘5’.

[POc &ast;_nima-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-2-463-POc-nima-a)

Motu _la-ima_ ‘5 (of people)’ reflects POc _&ast;la-lima_ (< PAn _&ast;la-lima_) ‘5 (of people)’, but there are no other known Oceanic reflexes.


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. From six to nine


Since numerous languages in NW Melanesia and Vanuatu have systems that include base-5, i.e. they count ‘5 + 1’ for ‘6’ etc ([§15.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-7#cldf:6-14)), there are fewer reflexes of inherited decimal 6–9 than of 2–5.

Misima (PT) provides an unexplained phenomenon visible in the cognate sets below. It uses its reflexes of the POc forms _&ast;onom_ ‘6’, _&ast;pitu_ ‘7’ and _&ast;siwa_ ‘9’ for the ‘wrong’ numbers: Misima _e-won_ ‘7’, _e-pit_ ‘8’, _e-siwa_ ‘6’. The origin of _e-wata_ ‘9’ is unclear: it may reflect ‘4’, from an old 5 + 4 term.

#### 4.3.2. Seven


One ‘irregularity’ occurs in the cognate set reflecting POc _&ast;pitu_ ‘7’. Buma (TM) and a number of N Vanuatu languages reflect _&ast;bitu_ rather than _&ast;pitu_ ([Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009):59, 83).

By regular sound change PAn _&ast;Siwa_ would have become PMP _&ast;(h)iwa_, but, for reasons discussed by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1995c) ([1995c](Source#cldf:Blust1995c), [2013](Source#cldf:Blust2013):728), _&ast;Siwa_ instead became PMP _&ast;siwa_ the form that was inherited by POc.

#### 4.3.5. Subtractive numerals 6–9


A few languages with a decimal system form the numerals 7–9 subtractively, i.e. 10–3, 10–2, 10–1. These languages are Yapese, all Eastern Admiralties languages, and Engdewo (TM). A sample is shown in [Table 14.5](#table-14.5). Final _-p_ in Lou, final _-f_ in Ponam and final _-h[u]_ in Levei are the default classifier. Just one known language, Levei-Drehet, a pair of E Admiralties dialects, also has a subtractive numeral for 6.

<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Teens


In Oceanic languages that have terms for the teens, i.e. ‘11’, ‘12’, ‘13’ and so on, these usually consist of the term for ‘10’, followed by the term for the digit, regardless of whether either or both are mono- or polymorphemic. In some languages an ‘and’ conjunction intervenes, in others not. No reconstruction of these forms is attempted.


<a id="p-468"></a>


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Tens and hundreds


The structure of POc terms for tens and hundreds is discussed in [§14.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3-1#cldf:6-14) as part of an examination of the structures in which numeral classifiers were used. Whereas the POc numerals from 1 to 9 each consisted of a single morpheme, the tens and hundreds shown in [Table 14.1](#table-14.1) were each made up of three morphemes with the structures _&ast;X-[ŋa-]puluq_ ‘X times 10’ and _&ast;X-[ŋa-]Ratus_ ‘X times 100’. It emerges that POc _-puluq_ ‘unit of 10’ and _-Ratus_ ‘unit of 100’ were multiplicative classifiers within the &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure inherited from PMP. The structure was clearly at least somewhat productive in POc as it continued on into PPn, where apparently new members had been added to the set of classifiers, e.g. PEOc _&ast;-rau_ ‘unit of 100’ ([§14.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-4#cldf:6-14)).


<a id="s-4-5-1"></a>

#### 4.5.1. Reconstructing forms for tens and hundreds


The data reveal that in POc _&ast;sa=_ and _&ast;ŋa=_ were separate morphemes, but were being merged with the following classifier in some dialects by the time POc broke up, so that _&ast;-puluq_ was replaced as ‘unit of 10’ by a reflex of either _&ast;-ŋapuluq_ or _&ast;saŋapuluq_, or occasionally _&ast;sapuluq_.

Evidence that POc _&ast;-ŋa-_ was a separate morpheme is seen in [§14.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3-1#cldf:6-14), where its Tongan reflexes occur only sporadically with the numerals 2 and 3. Archaic Samoan ([Mosel & Hovdhaugen 1992](Source#cldf:MoselandHovdhaugen1992):117) provides similar evidence: _-ŋa-_ is missing after _se-_ ‘one’ and _lua-_ ‘2’ but present from _tolu-_ ‘3’ onward:

17)

|                     |           |            |                |
|:--------------------|:----------|:-----------|:---------------|
|                     | ‘one’     | ‘2’        | ‘3’            |
| tens:               | _se-fulu_ | _lua-fulu_ | _tolu-ŋa-fulu_ |
| scores of coconuts: | _se-aea_  | _lua-aea_  | _tolu-ŋa-aea_  |

The vast majority of Oceanic decimal systems reflect _&ast;sa-ŋa-puluq_ and _&ast;sa-ŋa-Ratus_, but a small scattering of Western Oceanic languages reflects POc _&ast;sa-puluq_ ‘10’ and _&ast;sa-Ratus_ ‘100’, witnessing to the POc separability of _&ast;ŋa_ and to the possibility that the ancestral forms of ‘10’ and ‘100’ lacked _&ast;ŋa_. The two sets below include all known reflexes.

[PAn &ast;_sa-puluq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-5-468-POc-sapuluq-a)


<a id="p-469"></a>

Examples listed under ‘cf. also’ above are ‘false positives’: numerals that look as if they might reflect _&ast;sa-puluq_ but which on closer examination either probably or certainly don’t. Uruava _avūru_ and Mono-Alu _lahulu_ could reflect either _&ast;sapuluq_ or _&ast;saŋapuluq_.[^16] Teop _sāvun_ seems to reflect _&ast;sapuluq_ rather than _&ast;saŋapuluq_, as Teop does not regularly lose _&ast;ŋ_ (but this does not explain long _-ā-_)

[PMP &ast;_sa-Ratus_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-4-5-469-POc-saratus-a)

Except for Bukawa, which is vigesimal from 20 upward, the languages that reflect _&ast;sa-puluq_ treat it as ‘unit of 10’, i.e. they have generalised it to all decades, as [Table 14.6](#table-14.6) shows.

Evidence that POc _&ast;sapuluq_ ‘10’ occurred alongside _&ast;saŋapuluq_ also includes the fact that some WMP languages reflect a contrast between cognates of _&ast;sa-puluq_ ‘10’ and _&ast;rua-ŋa-puluq_ ‘20’: Javanese _sa=puluh_ but _ro=ŋ puluh_; Manggarai _cə=pulu_ but _sua m=pulu_. A tempting inference is that _&ast;sa-puluq_ and _&ast;sa-Ratus_ were the original POc forms and that _&ast;sa-ŋa-puluq_ and _&ast;sa-ŋa-Ratus_ reflect an extension of the pattern of higher decades and centades to ‘10’. This may be so, but we do not know when this extension occurred: before POc or in POc?

At any rate, a large majority of Oceanic reflexes reflect the longer forms. The sets below are each just a sample of their reflexes. Certain groupings—North New Guinea, Papuan Tip and Micronesian—are ill-represented, and an area from Epi Island (NCV) southward embracing Efate, S Vanuatu and New Caledonia is not represented at all, because these languages have adopted a tally system and replaced _&ast;sa[ŋa]pulu_ by another lexical item ([§15.8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-8-2#cldf:6-14)).

<a id="p-471"></a>

The Chuukic (Mic) reflexes of _&ast;sa-ŋa-Ratus_ above are perhaps borrowed from an unknown source, as they mean ‘1000’ rather than ‘100’, and _&ast;R_ is more frequently lost than reflected as PMic _&ast;r_. However, the change in power may be a result of the practice of counting tens of certain objects, e.g. piles of ten coconuts (see discussion under [§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14) below).


<a id="s-4-5-2"></a>

#### 4.5.2. Early Oceanic developments affecting tens and hundreds


[Table 14.6](#table-14.6) shows that languages that reflect _&ast;sa-puluq_ treat it as ‘unit of 10’, i.e. _&ast;sa-_ has lost its identity as a morpheme and has combined with _&ast;-puluq_, generalising it to all decades. The crucial evidence for this comes from languages that have applied the [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} construction to tens and hundreds, giving numerals like Nakanai _savulu lua_.

A similar process affecting _&ast;ŋa puluq_ and other instances of _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} is illustrated for Ponam in [Table 14.3](#table-14.3) and represents the situation throughout E Admiralty and Micronesian. Here fusion occurred first, so that the reflexes of _&ast;-ŋapuluq_ and _&ast;-ŋaRatus_ were treated as unitary classifiers, and the structure [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} was thus reinterpreted as [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps}. It was into this structure that other classifiers were then recruited. This process seems to have occurred in a good many early Oceanic dialects, with critical evidence from languages that then reversed [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps} to [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps}. Most such languages are N-C Vanuatu languages of the islands Ambae, south Pentecost, Santo, Ambrym and Malakula. Thus in Araki (south Santo) we find _saŋavulu_ ‘10’ but _ŋavul rua_ ‘20’, _ŋavul rolu_ ‘30’ and so on.


<a id="p-472"></a>

Some early dialects took this process a step further and treated their reflex of &ast;saŋapuluq as the ‘unit of ten’ morpheme. Examples are given in [Table 14.7](#table-14.7). Those in the upper part of the table, which have the structure [NML]{.smallcaps} + _saŋapuluq_, are found in scattered locations. Those in the lower part have the structure _saŋapuluq_ + [NML]{.smallcaps}. They are also scattered, but particularly well represented in N-C Vanuatu, found in the Torres and Banks Islands, Maewo, north Pentecost and further south in southeast Malakula and Ambrym.[^18]

Although the evidence above indicates that _&ast;sapuluq_, _&ast;ŋapuluq_ and _&ast;saŋapuluq_ were each reinterpreted in various languages as a morpheme for ‘unit of 10’, there is nonetheless evidence that the PPn reflex _&ast;-fulu_ retained its function and that in this respect Polynesian is again a relic area. The Polynesian data are shown in [Table 14.8](#table-14.8).[^19] Ten itself and tens from 30 upward have the _rua ŋapuluq_ template, but the term for 20 was PPn _&ast;rua-fulu_, with the _rua puluq_ template. Why the term for 20 is the odd one out is not clear, but [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) comments that PPn _&ast;rua-fulu_ ‘20’ and Samoan _se-fulu_ ‘10’ indicate that PPn _&ast;fulu_ was analysable as ‘unit of 10’, again pointing to POc _&ast;puluq_ ‘unit of 10’.

<a id="p-473"></a>

The evidence above thus indicates that reflexes of _&ast;puluq_, _&ast;sapuluq_, _&ast;ŋapuluq_ and _&ast;saŋapuluq_ all served as early Oceanic morphemes meaning ‘unit of 10’. The fact that there are far more reflexes of _&ast;ŋapuluq_ than of _&ast;puluq_ or _&ast;sapuluq_ can be attributed to the fact that _&ast;ŋapuluq_ played a much larger role in the number system, in 20 to 90, and that it was probably segmented out from the numerals for 30 to 90 at different times and places.

By the time of its break-up, i.e. the point at which innovations no longer affected all its dialects, POc was spoken over an area that included at least the Bismarck Archipelago and probably Buka, Bougainville and islands further to the southeast. Inevitably, there were dialect differences—differences that led to its split into Oceanic subgroups—and each of the four morphemes occurred in a different dialect range without impairing mutual intelligibility. There is one intriguing feature in the distribution of reflexes of these morphemes. N-C Vanuatu languages reflecting _&ast;saŋapuluq_ ‘unit of ten’ almost correspond areally with those reflecting _&ast;ŋapuluq_, i.e. N-C Vanuatu numeral systems in this respect form a patchwork.


<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Thousands and above


The reconstructed PMP term for a thousand is _&ast;Ribu_ (ACD). On this basis a POc term †_&ast;Ri(p,b)u_ might be expected, but the only candidate reflexes are Tolai (MM) _arip_ (also borrowed into various New Ireland languages) and Kiribati (Mic) _te-rebu_ (where _te-_ is an article). But the regular Tolai reflex of POc †_&ast;Ri(p,b)u_ would be †_ribu_ or †_rivu_, and the regular Kiribati reflex †_ibu_ or †_iu_. Thus neither is a directly inherited reflex of PMP _&ast;Ribu_.

Nonetheless languages in many different parts of Oceania have lexical items meaning ‘thousand’ and higher powers of ten (see [§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14)). Most of these are local innovations with only a limited geographic distribution. Some, at least, were originally terms for ‘some’, ‘many’ or ‘all’ that have been co-opted into the numeral system, illustrated by the examples below.

### 4.7. The interrogative numeral


The interrogative numeral _&ast;pica_ ‘how many?’ is widely reflected in Oceanic. Typically its reflex in a given language occurs in any slot where a numeral may occur in that language. This means, among other things, that in a language with numeral classifiers the reflex of &ast;pica may also cooccur with a classifier.

## 5. Reconstructing non-cardinal numerals


As well as the cardinal functions described in [§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14), numerals perform a number of other functions:

- _ordinals_ specify membership in a sequence, e.g. ‘the third coconut’;
- _frequentative adverbs_ specify how many times some event occurs, e.g. ‘twice’, ‘three times’;
- _distributive adverbials_ to specify the size of groups, e.g. ‘three at a time’, ‘three by three’.


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Ordinals


Typically Oceanic languages have a dedicated term for ‘first’ that means something like ‘at the front’. No term is reconstructable.

Descriptions of various Oceanic languages tell us that they do not have dedicated ordinal numerals, but they do have a strategy for expressing position in a sequence. The most common strategy is to express ‘the third house’ as something like ‘the (number) three of the houses’. ‘Houses’ is thus the possessor of the numeral. In consequence many Oceanic languages form an ordinal by attaching a possessor suffix to the numeral, usually a suffix reflecting POc _&ast;-ña_ ‘P:3SG’. POc [NML]{.smallcaps}-_&ast;ña_ is thus the schematic reconstruction for an ordinal. That is, POc ordinals were _&ast;rua-ña_ ‘2nd’, _&ast;tolu-ña_ ‘3rd’ and so on. Typically, if a cardinal numeral occurs with a classifier or a fossil classifier, this is retained in the ordinal form, as the listing below shows.

[POc &ast;_NML-ña_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-476-POc-nmlna-a)


<a id="p-477"></a>

In some languages of Malakula the alienable possession structure is used instead. The numeral is followed by a reflex of &ast;na-ña, which [Pearce](Source#cldf:Pearce2015) ([2015](Source#cldf:Pearce2015)) translates as ‘of it’ (_&ast;na-_ possessive classifier; _&ast;-ña_ p:3sg).

[6-14-5-1-477-ncv-tirax-nmlnan](cf.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-477-ncv-tirax-nmlnan)

The corresponding structure occurs in Kove (NNG):

[6-14-5-1-477-42](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-477-42)

The possessive noun phrase strategy for expressing ordinals continues into Fijian and Polynesian languages, in spite of the fact that Polynesian possessive morphosyntax is different from most non-Polynesian Oceanic languages. The Bauan in (19a), for example, means more literally ‘the (number) 3 of the children’.

[6-14-5-1-477-43](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-477-43)


<a id="p-478"></a>

Alternatively, in languages across much of Oceania an ordinal numeral is formed by attaching the POc causative prefix _&ast;pa[ka]-_ to the numeral, sometimes with the 3SG possessor suffix, sometimes not. What function the causative prefix plays here is unclear. Often there is also a 3SG possessor suffix as in the cognate set above. Where there is none, presumably an alienable possession structure is used.

[POc &ast;_pa&#91;ka&#93;-NML-ña_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-478-POc-pakanmlna-a)

Because the ordinal is treated as possessum, it is a nominal. In the cognate sets above this is visible in the addition of the 3SG possessor suffix, but a number of languages treat an ordinal as a verb (see (13) and (14) in [§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14)) and add nominalising morphology. The W Central Papuan languages Motu, Lala, Roro and Mekeo and the New Georgia languages Kubokota, Roviana, Ughele, Hoava and Vangunu all add a nominaliser to a form with a causative prefix (see above). The former add the instrumental nominalising prefix _i-_ (< POc _&ast;i-_), the latter the general nominalising infix _⟨in⟩_ (< POc _&ast;⟨in⟩_). N-C Vanuatu languages had a variety of nominalising morphemes.

[6-14-5-1-478-pt-lala-ivanmlna](cf.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-478-pt-lala-ivanmlna)


<a id="p-479"></a>

A further POc ordinal form, _&ast;i-ka-_,[^20] is reconstructable on the basis of both external reflexes and the Fijian reflexes below. PMP and POc _&ast;i-_ were clearly nominalising affixes (vol 1:28–29), and the Bauan example cited in (19a) indicates that it still is a nominalisation occupying the possessum slot in the possessive structure. This reconstruction raises questions. Why are the Oceanic reflexes confined to Remote Oceanic? Perhaps because other forms of nominalisation, exemplified above, replaced them. The Micronesian forms have prefixes that in the modern languages are causative. Do they reflect a reduced form of POc _&ast;paka-_ and thus belong in the cognate set above? One cannot tell.

[PAn &ast;_Si-ka-NML_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-5-1-479-POc-ikanml-a)

A disturbing aspect of these reconstructions is that it is difficult to imagine that POc had three structures for forming ordinals, namely &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps}-_ña_, _&ast;pa[ka]_-[NML]{.smallcaps}-_ña_ and _&ast;i-ka_-[NML]{.smallcaps}. There are formal overlaps among them, but they cannot be reduced to just one or two reconstructions without a good deal of speculative reasoning.


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Frequentative adverbs


The reconstruction of the POc frequentative adverb form _&ast;pa[ka]_-[NML]{.smallcaps} is straightforward, as it has cognates in South Halmahera languages (Buli _vai_-[NML]{.smallcaps}; Taba _ha_-[NML]{.smallcaps}), strongly implying that the form is reconstructable to PEMP. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _&ast;maka-lima_ ‘5 times’ etc. This appears to have been an actor voice verb ‘do 5 times’, the stem form of which would have been PAn _&ast;paka-lima_. The morphological structure thus has a long history.

The cognate set is patchy. There are areas, especially in Western Oceanic, where the structure is not reported at all. In languages with numeral classifiers a classifier meaning ‘times’ has displaced the POc structure ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)). In many other languages it has been replaced by a periphrastic structure like English three times, and ‘times’ has sometimes become a classifier ([§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14)). The choice of term for ‘time, occasion’ in these languages varies from language to language, and is evidently the outcome of local innovation. In N- C Vanuatu languages, on the other hand, retention of the POc structure is the general rule.


<a id="p-480"></a>

<a id="p-481"></a>


<a id="s-5-3"></a>

### 5.3. Distributive numerals


POc distributive numerals (‘two by two; two at a time; two each’ etc) were formed by full reduplication. Typically, where a prefix has become part of the corresponding cardinal numeral, the prefix does not form part of the reduplicand (Nakanai, Bugotu, Vurës, Tamambo, NE Ambae, Raga) but there are exceptions to this (Tungak, Uripiv). In a few languages reduplication is now incomplete or irregular: e.g. Nakanai CV-CV…, but _i-lima-lima_ ‘5 by 5’.

[PAn &ast;_NML-NML_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-5-3-481-POc-nmlnml-a)

PPn had a dedicated distributive morpheme, _&ast;taki-_, prefixed to the numeral. Cognate with this is Wayan Fijian _teki-_, also prefixed to numerals and quantity words but meaning ‘divided into X parts’. This perhaps reflects the function of PCP _&ast;taki-_, but there is insufficient evidence to confirm this.

## 6. Reconstructing POc numeral classifiers


Numeral classifiers and their semantic classes are described in [§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-14). If it is assumed that all languages have mensural classifiers, a language’s classifier structure is the one in which a mensural classifier occurs. This definition serves well, except in certain Polynesian languages, where there is more than one classifier structure. These languages retain the pre-POc [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure ([§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14)ff) in limited contexts alongside the more recent [CLF]{.smallcaps}-[NML]{.smallcaps} structure, implying that POc also did so. In the reconstructions below, a hyphen in front of the classifier indicates that it occurred in the POc [NML]{.smallcaps}[_&ast;-ŋa_]-[CLF]{.smallcaps} structure; a hyphen after the classifier indicates that it occurred in the POc [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure. Some classifiers evidently occurred in both constructions.

The question to be answered in reconstructing a POc classifier is, Is there evidence of shared inheritance or are we looking at parallel innovation, i.e. the independent but parallel recruitment of cognate nouns into the classifier category? Two characteristics of a cognate set can hint that it is inherited from POc.

The stronger hint is semantic __bleaching__. A classifier is an outcome of grammaticalisation, usually of a noun. Two things happen during grammaticalisation: the morpheme increases in bondedness (e.g. becomes an affix) and it undergoes semantic bleaching, i.e. its sense becomes increasingly general. If the same semantic bleaching occurs in two Oceanic subgroups or in one Oceanic and one non-Oceanic subgroup, then this is evidence that the bleaching was already present in POc. The POc classifier _&ast;-pua_/_&ast;pua-_ ‘default inanimate; round object’, derived from _&ast;puaq_ ‘fruit’, represents extreme bleaching ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)).

The second characteristic is that if some members of the cognate set occur as functionless __fossilised__ prefixes to lower simple numerals ([Map 14.2](#map-6-14_2)), then that cognate set is likely to be old, and probably of POc antiquity. Reflexes of _&ast;pua-_ now form inseparable prefixes in a number of languages.


<a id="p-483"></a>

Reconstructions sometimes require data from a non-Oceanic language, and the latter are included in some of the cognate sets below.[^21] A datum from one of these languages is only cited if it is glossed as a classifier in the source.

The vast majority of classifier cognate sets in Oceanic languages display neither of the two characteristics and are very probably more recently grammaticalised recruits. This raises a further question. Why have numeral classifier classes blossomed in a few Oceanic subgroups and (almost) vanished from others? Part of the answer may be contact, as bilingualism can transfer semantic patterns from language to language, but there is very little substantive Oceanic evidence about this, positive or negative.


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Sortal classifiers


Sortal classifiers are not evenly distributed across Oceanic. Quite elaborate systems are found in Admiralties, Kilivila and Sudest (PT), New Caledonia, Micronesian, Tongic (Pn) and NPn languages. The odd sortal classifier survives in other Papuan Tip languages, in Solos and Banoni (MM, Bougainville) and in a few Malaita-Makira (SES) languages. Fossils are found in numerous Meso-Melanesian and N-C Vanuatu languages, indicating that at least certain basic classifiers occurred there once upon a time. No sign of sortal classifiers is found in North New Guinea languages.

The cognate set supporting POc _&ast;pua_ ‘round object; default inanimate’ shows both bleaching and fossilisation. The default classifier is used where no classifier with a more specific meaning applies. This is the ultimate case of semantic bleaching in a classifier. POc _&ast;pua_ was derived from the term for ‘fruit’, then bleached to denote any roundish object, and finally bleached further to become the default inanimate classifier. Its Hawu and Buli cognates are glossed as the classifier for a disparate collection of inanimate objects; it is thus the default classifier in these languages. It also satisfies the fossil criterion: almost all its reflexes in Meso-Melanesian languages and all its N-C Vanuatu reflexes are fossils that are today part of the numeral.

The term ‘default’ is used below for a classifier that is used where no other classifier is appropriate or the speaker does not recall the appropriate classifier. Some sources call this the ‘general’ classifier .

[Hawu &ast;_wuə, ɓuə_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-483-POc-pua-a)


<a id="p-484"></a>


<a id="p-485"></a>

The cognate set supporting POc _&ast;kai_ also displays bleaching and fossilisation. All reflexes are consistent with the reconstruction _&ast;kai_ except those in the Central Papuan languages Aroma, Hula, Balawaia and Motu, which support †_&ast;kau-_. The POc noun corresponding to this classifier was _&ast;kayu_ ‘tree’, with reflexes in _-ai_ and _-au_. The Central Papuan languages also have noun forms in _-au_. An economic explanation of the classifier forms is that they have been reshaped to line up with the noun forms. Another set of exceptions is provided by the Micronesian reflexes, which require the reconstruction of two PMic forms: _&ast;-ai_ ‘long slender object’ and _&ast;-kai_ ‘plant, tree, stick’. I take _&ast;-ai_ to reflect the POc classifier and _&ast;kai_ to be a more recent formation based on PMic _&ast;kayu_ ‘wood, pole’.

POc _&ast;kai-_ is widely reflected as a fossilised numeral prefix, suggesting that it became the default inanimate classifier in place of _&ast;pua-_ in parts of Oceanic. Attributive numeral forms in some languages take a prefix reflecting POc _&ast;ka-_, but this almost certainly does not reflect the POc classifier _&ast;kai-_. There is just one instance where the attributive prefix clearly reflects _&ast;kai-_, namely NE Ambae _kai-_.[^22] All other attributives reflect _&ast;ka-_ ([§14.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4#cldf:6-14)) and this is reason enough to reconstruct attributive _&ast;ka-_ and classifier _&ast;kai-_ separately, and to assume that the two became conflated in NE Ambae.

[Nauete &ast;_kai-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-485-POc-kai-a)


<a id="p-486"></a>

POc _&ast;tau-_ below does not satisfy the semantic bleaching criterion. The initial consonant of the Micronesian forms reflects prenasalisation, i.e. _&ast;-ŋa-tau_ > _&ast;-ŋ-tau_ > &ast;-PMic _&ast;-dau_).

[Kambera &ast;_tau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-486-POc-tau-a)


<a id="p-487"></a>

The reconstruction below satisfies only the distribution criterion, and it seems unlikely that it was present in POc, the more so as it would have been in semantic competition with &ast;tau- above. More probably it was innovated independently in certain CMP and New Caledonian languages from the noun PCEMP/POc _&ast;qata_.

[Lamaholot &ast;_ata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-487-POc-qata-a)

POc _&ast;manu-_ satisfies the semantic bleaching and distribution criteria. Investigating the POc sense of the noun _&ast;manuk_, Pawley ([vol.4:449](ContributionTable?anchor=p-449#cldf:4-8)–450) concludes that it denoted birds and other flying creatures, but not land animals. The fact that ‘animate’ can be reconstructed as the POc sense of the classifier _&ast;manu-_ thus points to bleaching. However, as no non-Oceanic classifier cognate has been found, it is less certain than for _&ast;pua-_ and _&ast;kai-_ that this bleaching had occurred in POc. Awa _mano-_ refers only to birds, and may be a recently innovated classifier.

That _&ast;manu-_ does not satisfy the fossil criterion is not surprising. Classifiers that have frequent use because they refer to human beings or because their referents form a large category (like _&ast;pua-_ and _&ast;kai-_ above) are more likely candidates for fossilisation.

[Ambai &ast;_man-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-487-POc-manu-a)


<a id="p-488"></a>

POc _&ast;qapa-_ ‘flat object; sheet of s.t.; leaf’ meets the bleaching and distribution criteria. Semantic bleaching is inferred from the glosses of its reflexes, as there is no noun known from which it is derived.

[POc &ast;_qapa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-488-POc-qapa-a)

POc _&ast;pata_ ‘long cylindrical object; tree trunk’ meets both criteria.

[Buru &ast;_fatan_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-1-488-POc-pata-a)

Certain other cognate sets have been rejected as they are apparently not of POc antiquity. For example, hypothetical †_&ast;rau-_ ‘flat object; leaf’ (cf POc _&ast;raun_ ‘leaf’; [vol.3:103](ContributionTable?anchor=p-103#cldf:3-4)–104) is found only in Micronesian languages. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) includes it among his PPn reconstructions, but the reflexes in POLLEX online are unconvincing for this sense, making even a PROc reconstruction insecure. A better attested classifier reconstruction for ‘flat object; leaf’ is POc _&ast;qapa-_ above.


<a id="p-489"></a>


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Mensural classifiers


Of the characteristics that hint at POc antiquity, only the criterion of distribution consistently applies to mensural classifiers. There is typically little or no semantic bleaching, as the noun from which a mensural classifier is derived has a mensural sense already. There is no fossilisation, as fossilisation happens to sortal classifiers that refer to individuals, not collections.

The best supported mensural classifier is POc _&ast;buŋ(V)-_ ‘bunch (of fruit). From the glosses of its reflexes it seems that its primary use may have been for bunches of betelnuts.

[POc &ast;_buŋV_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-2-489-POc-buv-a)

POc _&ast;qiti-_ and _&ast;qi-_ ‘hand of bananas’ are a pair of reconstructions with the same meaning, the latter presumably an abbreviation of the former. They both meet only the distribution criterion.

[Kéo &ast;_xi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-2-489-POc-qiti-a)

The reconstruction below is attributed to POc because it meets the distribution criterion. The initial consonant of the Micronesian forms reflects prenasalisation, i.e. _&ast;-ŋa-pui_ > _&ast;-ŋ-pui_ > PMic _&ast;-bui_.

### 6.3. Enumerative classifiers (ECs)[^25]


Enumerative classifiers have somewhat different geographic distribution from sortal and mensural classifiers. In subgroups that have an elaborate paradigm of grammaticalised sortal and mensural classifiers, i.e. Kilivila (PT), New Caledonian, Micronesian, Tongic (Pn) and Nuclear Polynesian languages, ECs also typically occur, but they appear to be absent from Admiralties and N-C Vanuatu. They are also found in SE Solomonic languages, which otherwise lack classifiers, as well as a few in North New Guinea languages around the Vitiaz Strait and in Fijian dialects.

With one possible exception no POc EC is reconstructable. The exception is _&ast;waRo-_ ‘a string of a specified number of a product’, which reflects POc _&ast;waRoc_ ‘vine or creeper’ ([vol.3:74](ContributionTable?anchor=p-74#cldf:3-3)–75), a term whose reflexes often also denote string or rope. However, the probability that reflexes of _&ast;waRoc_ have become ECs independently in different languages at different times and places is strong, so it is uncertain whether it already functioned as an EC in POc.

[POc &ast;_waRo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-3-490-POc-waro-a)


<a id="p-491"></a>

Most ECs are reconstructable only for a protolanguage ancestral to one of the subgroups mentioned above. Does this mean that ECs did not occur in POc? Their complete absence is improbable, given what can be inferred about their cultural context ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).4). Further, there are ECs in some CMP and SHWNG languages, e.g. Rongga _liwu_ ‘4 coconuts’; _ulu_ ‘10 liwu’, i.e. ‘40 coconuts’; Ambai _boa-_ ‘4 large fish’.

[PCP &ast;_mata-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-3-491-PCP-mata-a)

Because of the absence of reconstructable ECs this section describes the distribution of ECs by various parameters, arguing that these distributions were largely true of POc, even if the forms cannot be reconstructed.

Of the 383 Oceanic languages from which data were collected, ECs were recorded for 69. The total number of ECs recorded from these 69 languages was 394. This is simply a product of what linguists and ethnographers have recorded. It is not a sample in a statistical sense. What follow are thus only rough generalisations.

The absence of ECs from Admiralties languages is odd. For Ponam (Adm), where customary public counting certainly did occur ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).1), [Carrier](Source#cldf:Carrier1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Carrier1981)) records classifiers with meanings such as ‘a bundle of X’ or ‘a string of X’, but none containing a multiplicand, e.g. 3 in ‘a bundle of 3 coconuts’ or 10 in ‘a string of 10 fish’.

What do ECs usually count? In Micronesian languages, where a classifier accompanies every counted item, coconuts, fish and breadfruit stand out as the items that are often accompanied by an EC. In SE Solomonic and Polynesian languages, on the other hand, only certain items require a classifier ([Lichtenberk 2008b](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008b):264–265). [Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b) ([2007b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b):226–228) ask why certain objects were counted specifically, while others were not. After dismissing various answers that are not supported by reality, they conclude:

> Abundance cannot have been the criteria either, as many objects that are plentiful in the islands – such as taro, sweet potatoes, breadfruit, or mangoes – were not counted specifically. __However, if we combine importance, or rather cultural significance__ __with abundance, we obtain an intersection that precisely maps onto the group of__ __specifically counted objects.__ While things like kava, lobster, or pigs are culturally salient, they are not plentiful; and breadfruit, taro, or mangoes, on the other hand, are abundant, but not appreciated as much as comparable products. Only coconuts, yam, fish, and the material for thatching houses and weaving mats are both important and abundant. (Bolding mine)


<a id="p-492"></a>

The observation in bold type holds for Oceanic languages generally. Coconuts and fish are almost universally counted with ECs in Oceanic languages that have them. There are also ECs for bananas across most of Oceania. Taro and yams are also frequently counted with ECs, but not in Micronesia, where they are less valued or less abundant than breadfruit.[^26] Betelnut, chewed as a stimulant across Near Oceania, is counted with ECs in Papuan Tip and in NW and SE Solomonic (it is not chewed in Remote Oceania).

Except for betelnut, all the items named in the previous paragraph are foods and, as one might expect, at scattered Oceanic locations other foods are counted with ECs: sago in the Huon Gulf (NNG) and Papuan Tip, canarium nuts in North New Guinea and SE Solomonic, crabs in SE Solomonic, Fijian and Polynesian, flying foxes in Malaita (SES) and northern New Caledonia.[^27]

There are ECs for pigs in Papuan Tip, SE Solomonic, Fijian and Polynesian. Given the ubiquity of pigs as wealth items in Oceania, one might expect to find ECs with them almost everywhere. Where they are not found, perhaps pigs are counted individually, not in groups.

[Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a) ([2006a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a)) also mention thatching material. ECs are used for sago thatching in North New Guinea languages around the Vitiaz Strait and in the Schouten Islands and for unspecified thatching in Malaita and Tonga.

Another item that turns up in the data is traditional money, centred on but not exclusive to the SE Solomons. There are ECs for several kinds of shell money and for the teeth of dogs, bats, dolphins, and certain fish, and in Fiji for whale teeth. The relationship of traditional money to ceremonial exchanges and distributions is self-evident.

Bender & Beller’s characterisation of items that cooccur with ECs as ‘culturally salient and abundant’ can thus be extended to all parts of Oceania where ECs are used, and it can be inferred that ECs occurred with such items in POc speech.

The number of items that an EC refers to—its multiplicand—is determined by the nature of the item and by local conventions of public display.

[6-14-6-3-492-44](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-6-3-492-44)


<a id="p-493"></a>

Thus Belep speakers evidently tie pieces of sugarcane in tens, Samoans tie coconuts in pairs and Tuam speakers do the same with fish.

[Hill & Unger](Source#cldf:HillandUnger2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:HillandUnger2018):125) find that ECs with multiplicands of ten occur only in languages that have retained a decimal system, like Lengo.

[6-14-6-3-493-45](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-6-3-493-45)

Their generalisation is confirmed by the data collected for this chapter. In (21) _ɣaivolo_ means ‘ten garden rows’, and a coherent answer is, for example, _e ono na ɣaivolo_ [3SG 6 ART [CLF]{.smallcaps}] ‘sixty garden rows’.

There is no other correlation between numeral system and multiplicands. The converse generalisation does not apply: languages with decimal systems often have ECs with a multiplicand other than ten or a power of ten.

[6-14-6-3-493-46](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-6-3-493-46)

Indeed, ECs with a multiplicand below 10—they include 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6—occur in languages with base-10, base-5-10, base-5-10-20 and base-5-20 systems.

The correlation between the multiplicand and the product counted is also minimal. In different places coconuts are counted in groups of 2, 3, 4 or 6. The coconuts will be ripe and have been husked, and the fibres on the surface after husking readily allow 2 or 3 coconuts to be tied together. These bundles may in turn be set out in twos to give units of 4 and 6 (no unit of 5 coconuts is found). Fish usually fall into two conventional categories: a fish large enough to form a cooking parcel by itself, and smaller fish that are strung. A string may consist of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 fish in Tuam, Nêlêmwa, Bariai, Chuukese and Halia respectively. These differences are presumably based on fish-size plus convention. A number of languages with decimal counting, however, allow strings of 10 fish. Larger, manufactured items are typically counted in pairs. They include pandanus-leaf mats, sleeping mattresses, and lengths of sago thatching attached to some kind of pole, sometimes split bamboos, although the latter are sometimes counted in 3s or 4s.

Probably the most detailed record of ECs in an Oceanic language is [Fox’s](Source#cldf:Fox1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Fox1931)) description of the hierarchies of ECs in Arosi (SES), on which [Table 14.9](#table-14.9) is based. The second row shows the units that are counted. There are both similarities and differences between the hierarchies used with different objects. A search through [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) reveals very few alternative meanings for the terms in [Table 14.9](#table-14.9), and the original meanings of Arosi ECs have apparently been lost.[^28]

Arosi has a base-10 system, but speakers often counted in pairs. East Arosi counts yams in pairs, whereas West Arosi counts single yams. This is why _waioa_ ‘a pair’ occurs on different lines under W and E Arosi: in W Arosi it denotes ‘2’, in E Arosi ‘1 pair’. It also means that _dumai_ denotes 5 yams in W Arosi, but 10 yams (5 pairs) in E Arosi—and this relationship between the two dialects is maintained through to _rau_, a million yams in W Arosi but 2 million in E Arosi. It does not account, though, for the fact that _wawaibeʔo_ means 1,000 yams in W Arosi but 20,000 in E Arosi: this is a case of the rather frequent phenomenon whereby words for higher numerals shift places, due presumably to infrequent usage.

E Arosi thus retains what is apparently an old Oceanic mode of counting by pairs. Some scholars assert that this is the relic of a binary-cum-vigesimal system, but [Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007a) ([2007a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007a)) show that this is not true. In the cases of yams and shell money, the decimal system is modified, skipping 10 with yams (_erua dumai_ means 2 fives) and accommodating multiples of 5. The counting of coconuts and teeth on the other hand, is straightforwardly decimal except for _iʔa-hunu_ (literally ‘fish finished’), but with units of 2 or 4.

Somewhat striking is the counting of breadfruit. Again, W Arosi counts single fruits but E Arosi counts pairs. The plain numerals _eta_ ‘1’ and _erua_ ‘2’ are used, and E Arosi speakers know that if breadfruit are counted, the numerals refer to pairs.

Scattered relics suggest that hierarchies of ECs like those in Arosi were more widespread before the adoption of French or English numerals. There is evidence in other SE Solomonic languages. From Sa’a [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1918) ([1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918)) gives for yams _nao_ ‘100’, _sinola_ ‘1,000’, and _mola_ ‘10,000’; and for coconuts _pʷela_ ‘1000’, _rau_ ‘10,000’, and _udi_ ‘100,000’. From Owa [Mellow](Source#cldf:Mellow2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:Mellow2014)) lists for yams _apapana_ ‘50 pairs of yams’ and _aufi_ ‘100 pairs of yams’; and for coconuts _ɓaroɓaro_ ‘2’, _ausukau_ ‘10’, _ɣairirasi_ ‘100’.

|                                | 180 | _tolahun_  | = 30 _einase_ |

Further west, for taro tubers in Roviana (MM) [Waterhouse](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949)) lists _hioko_ ‘10 pairs’, _piŋuto_ ‘100 pairs’ and _hiako_ ‘1000 pairs’.

From Halia (MM) [Tsirumits et al.](Source#cldf:Tsirumitsetal2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Tsirumitsetal2005)) give the hierarchies in [Table 14.10](#table-14.10). Coconuts are counted in fours, each four tied together. Taro, sweet potato, betelnut and flying fish are counted in sixes, but the two hierarchies appear to multiply differently, perhaps because the data are fragmentary. Tsirumits et al. note that an _einase_ may also consist of a single tuna, which is larger than six flying fish. Presumably, an _einase_ was a package of fish for cooking. The term _tolahun_ (‘30 _einase_’) reflects POc _&ast;tolu-ŋapuluq_ ‘30’, but _tolahun_ functions only as an EC, as both 3 and 10 have undergone lexical replacement. Halia for ‘30’ is _topisa maloto_ ‘3 [×] 10’.

The Tolai (MM) counted wildfowl eggs in fours, taro in sixes, bananas in bundles of 4 hands, and fish in strings of no particular number. Coconuts were counted in pairs, with special terms for 1, 2, 3, 6 and 60 pairs ([Paraide 2008](Source#cldf:Paraide2008)).[^30]

A theme that crops up several times above is that scattered Oceanic languages counted certain objects in pairs. Pair-counting in Tongan has been thoroughly investigated by [Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b) ([2007b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2007b)), who write (p219),

> Among these objects were pieces of sugar cane thatch (_au_), coconuts (_niu_), pieces of yam for planting (_konga ‘ufi_ or _pulopula_), whole yam (_‘ufi_), and fish (_ika_). In addition to these objects listed in the Churchward Grammar (1953), several informants suggested that one type of pandanus leaves (_kie_) was counted in the same way as yam for planting. … The counting of these objects follows specific patterns that all have one feature in common: Counting proceeds in pairs and scores…. For all objects, the smallest unit is the pair: _nga’ahoa_ for sugar cane thatch, yam and fish, and _taua’i_ for coconuts. … While the counting of sugar cane thatch then proceeds in tens of pairs (tetula), hundreds and thousands of pairs (using the regular numerals for 100 and 1000, yet omitting the lexeme for “pair”), coconuts, yam and fish are, from 20 onwards, counted in scores. The term for “one score” is glossed differently depending on the counted object: _tekau_ for coconuts and occasionally yam, and _kau_ for yam and fish. For the counting of coconuts and yam, a further term refers to “10-scores” (_tefua_ for coconuts and _tefuhi_ for yam). The scores (_kau_) of fish, however, are regularly counted in number words from one to hundreds; the same can alternatively be done for yam.


<a id="p-496"></a>

This is reminiscent of Arosi above, even down to the detail that the Tongan listener knows without being told that sugarcane thatch is counted in pairs, just as the Arosi listener knows that this is true for breadfruit.

[Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006b) ([2006b](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006b):384–385) analyse similar pairwise systems in the EPn languages Tahitian, Mangarevan and traditional Maori. [Elbert’s](Source#cldf:Elbert1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):187) Rennellese audience of 1958 wondered why yams and breadfruit should be counted in pairs, and, as he writes later, without an EC ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).4). [Owens & Lean](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018):143), citing [Beaglehole & Beaglehole](Source#cldf:BeagleholeandBeaglehole1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:BeagleholeandBeaglehole1938)), note that coconuts are counted in pairs and that the terms used are in some cases identical to the ordinary numerals, i.e. listeners know that coconuts are counted this way.

Other fragments of evidence, namely unexpected numerals within decimal systems, point to pairwise counting. Wuvulu (Adm) and some Central Papuan (PT) languages have a decimal system with unusual numerals for 6 and 8 ([Table 14.11](#table-14.11)), e.g. Motu _taura-toi_ ‘6’ and _taura-hani_ ‘8’. Since _toi_ and _hani_ are 3 and 4 respectively, _taura-_ seems to mean ‘double’ (it is not listed separately in [Lister-Turner & Clark 1954a](Source#cldf:ListerTurnerandClark1954a)), and it is a reasonable inference that it reflects an earlier enumerative classifier meaning ‘pair’.[^32]

They entertain the possibility that this reflects a digit-tallying system, but think it more likely that Roviana _hioko-na_ ‘20’ reflects a pair-counting system. This is clearly correct, since _hioko_ is listed as ‘10 pairs of taro tubers’ by [Waterhouse](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949)). Other NW Solomonic languages of Choiseul, the New Georgia group and Santa Isabel also have a distinct word for 20. In languages where 20 is a simple numeral derived via a tally system, 20 is almost always derived from a noun meaning ‘man’ or ‘person’ ([§15.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-6#cldf:6-14)), but there is no sign of this in these NW Solomonic languages, leaving us with the possibility that, like Roviana _hioko_, these words mean ‘10 pairs (of something)’, i.e. a score. The terms form four cognate sets, but no origin for the three has been found.

23) a. _&ast;sioko-na_ (> Roviana _hioko-na_, Ughele _sioko-na_, Maringe _hiokonə putə_).
    b. _&ast;[ka]rabete_ > Vaghua, Varisi, Babatana _karabete_, Ririo _karbet_; Lungga and
       Ghanongga _rabete puta_, Simbo _rabate puta_, Nduke _rabete_
    c. _&ast;kauŋe_ > Hoava, Kusaghe _kauŋe_
    d. _&ast;varedaki_ > Zabana, Blablanga _varadaki_, Kokota _varedaki_.

The word _puta_/_putə_ in these examples means ‘sleep’, and is used in the sense of ‘finished’, ‘complete’.

Although the evidence in this subsection is fragmentary, it is well enough distributed to suggest that root crops (yams and taro tubers) were already counted in pairs in POc, and this was probably true of other products too.

There is also a tendency to count certain objects in fours. Rongga (CMP) _liwu_ ‘4 coconuts’, Gedaged (NNG) _wal_ ‘4 coconuts tied together’, Halia (MM) _piloto_ ‘4 coconuts’ ([Table 14.10](#table-14.10)) and various Arosi ECs ([Table 14.9](#table-14.9)) crop up in the discussion above. This has resulted in counting systems in which a base of 4 plays an important role.

Some speakers of Wuvulu (Adm; Hafford 2011) recall a quite complex system which counted coconuts in pairs, fours and sixteens. One to five pairs, i.e. 2 to 10 coconuts, are counted with the unaffixed numeral roots 1–5 _roa_, _rua_, _ʔolu_, _fa_ and _rea_, another instance of everyone knowing that certain items were counted in twos. However, 4–12 coconuts could also be counted in fours: _ʔobao_ ‘one bundle of 4’, _rua-ʔo_ ‘2 bundles of 4’, _ʔolu-ʔo_ ‘3 bundles of 4’, where _-ʔo_ was a bundle of 4. At this point the base-4 system dictates a new power of 4, and counting proceeds with the classifier _-moro_ ‘unit of 16’, as far as _fai-ma-moro_ [9×16] ‘144’.

The Wogeo (and Bam) numeral system, as reported by [Exter](Source#cldf:Exter2010) ([2010](Source#cldf:Exter2010)) and shown in [Table 14.12](#table-14.12), has a base of 4. The complex numerals from _kʷik_ ‘4’ upwards are easily parsed:[^33] _kʷik bʷa-kobʷá_ [4+1] ‘5’, _kʷik bʷa-ragó_ [4+2] ‘6’, _kʷik bʷe-tol_ [4+3] ‘7’, _kiki-rua_ [4×2] ‘8’, _kiki-rua bʷa-kobʷá_ [(4×2)+1] ‘9’ and so on. If this were a pure base-4 system, the numerals would continue thus to 15 [(4×3)+3], followed by a new simple term for 16 [^42]. But instead 16 is _kiki-vat_ [4×4] and complex numerals continue to 19 [(4×4)+3], as the new simple numeral is _usú_ ‘20’. Here there is a hiccup, as counting based on _usú_ continues only to 39 [20+(4×4)+3], as there is no †_usu-rua_ but the new simple numeral _kulemʷa_ ‘40’. At this point the system settles down, and _kulemʷa_, like _kʷik_, is used as far as _kulemʷa-vat_ ‘160’ [(40×4)], with complex numerals as far as 199 [(40×4)+20+(4×4)+3], and a new simple numeral _udol_ ‘200’,[^34] used as far as _udol-vat_ ‘800’ with complex numerals as far as 1,999. This is followed by _lima_ ‘1,000’, which continues as the base until _valú_ ‘5000’, which in turn gives way to _ka_ ‘25,000’. The system thus has bases 4, 20, 40, 200, 1000, 5000, 25000.

<a id="table-14.12"> </a>

: __Table 14.12__ The Wogeo (NNG) numeral system

|     | simple numerals   | fours      | twenties   | forties       | 200’s      | thousands   |
|----:|:------------------|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------|:-----------|:------------|
|   1 | _ta_              | _kʷik_     | _usú_      | _kulemʷa_     | _udol_     | _lima_      |

This extent of this system suggests that it has evolved almost entirely out of enumerative classifiers used in ceremonial contexts. Hogbin does not discuss counting in his 1970 ethnography, but often describes feasts, some of them large. The reliance on groups of four in a system that interacts with a base of 20 suggests a complex history whereby Wogeo once had a system like that of closely related Manam, with bases of 5, 10 and 20 ([§15.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-4-3#cldf:6-14)), but in which the practice of using basic numerals to count bundles of a specific quantity has replaced much of the system. Thus _kulemʷa_ in Manam (and its Kairiru cognate _qolem_) mean ‘10’, but in Wogeo _kulemʷa_ means ‘40’, implying that it was once used to count ten bundles of 4. The use of _lima_ (‘5’ in many Oceanic languages) for 1,000 implies a use counting 5 groups of 200.

[Owens & Lean](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018):118) seem to attribute the Wogeo base of 4 to counting on one’s fingers. Alone this leaves too many features of the system unaccounted for, but it is likely that _kʷik_ ‘4’ and its allomorph _kiki-_ reflect a term meaning something like ‘the four fingers of one hand’ ([§15.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15-6#cldf:6-14)).

The Sarmi-Jayapura languages Ormu and Yotafa evidently also have a base-4 system, but the data appear confused and analysis uncertain.

### 6.4. Multiplicative classifiers (MCs)


A multiplicative classifier (MC) is one which refers to a certain number of something, regardless of what the something is. The POc morphemes _&ast;[ŋa]puluq_ ‘100’ and _&ast;[ŋa]Ratus_ ‘1000’ were descended from members of an older classifier class ([§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14)). They must still have belonged to the classifier class in POc, as their modern descendants are MCs in languages that have numeral classifiers. In some cases, an enumerative classifier denoting a power of 10 has replaced -puluq or _&ast;-Ratus_ or has become the term for a higher power.

The set below appears to date back to a POc enumerative classifier. Its form suggests that it is derived from POc _&ast;ikan_ ‘fish’, but there is nothing in the glosses of its reflexes that supports this, and why it might have been in competition with POc _&ast;puluq_ is a mystery.

[POc &ast;_-ika_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-4-498-POc-ika-a)


<a id="p-499"></a>

PCP _&ast;[-]rau_ has replaced POc _&ast;-Ratus_ ‘100’ in, e.g., Samoan _se-lau_ ‘100’ and _lua-lau_ ‘200’. The cognate set is given below. The extended meanings noted for Tongan, Mangarevan and Old Tahitian are derived from counting in pairs ([§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14)).

The term _&ast;[-]rau_ reflects POc _&ast;raun_ ‘leaf’ and its genesis is discussed briefly below the set.

[PCP &ast;_rau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-4-499-PCP-rau-a)


<a id="p-500"></a>

[Owens & Lean](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018):161) wonder whether _&ast;Ratus_ (their _&ast;Ratu_) and _&ast;rau_ (their _&ast;dau_) were in competition in POc. This misconstrues the data (see footnote 17). _&ast;Ratus_ and _&ast;raun_ were the POc terms for ‘100’ and ‘leaf’ respectively. Reflexes of _&ast;raun_ replaced _&ast;Ratus_ in certain Oceanic languages. The anecdotal reason for this is given by [Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1885) ([1885](Source#cldf:Codrington1885):249), who applies it to both _&ast;rau_ and Proto N Vanuatu _&ast;udolu_.

> To count the days after a death a [cycad] frond was taken, and beginning on one side of it a leaflet was counted for each day, one being pinched down as a tally for every tenth. The frond when treated in this way on both sides furnished tallies for a hundred, and the final death-feast was commonly held on the hundredth day.

[Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Fox1931)), talking about Arosi, says,

> When _husia_ is reached they nip off the leaves (_rawa_, _rau_) of a fern _tahutahu_, and when they are all nipped off this number was _rau_ [a million, see [Table 14.9](#table-14.9)], said to be 100 _husia_ [10,000], but probably varying in number.

[Paraide](Source#cldf:Paraide2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Paraide2008)) reports a similar practice for Tolai.

SE Solomonic, Micronesian and Polynesian in particular have innovated numerals for powers of ten ([Harrison & Jackson 1984](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984); [Bender & Beller 2006a](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2006a)) and many, if not all, of these seem to have their origin in enumerative classifiers dedicated to counting certain classes of referent that have been generalised to ever larger classes, as Harrison & Jackson recognised when they etymologised certain higher numerals in Micronesian languages. The evidence lies in cognate sets that include both enumerative and multiplicative classifiers. Two such are Proto Malaita-Makira _&ast;sinola_ and _&ast;pʷela_, which are usually enumerative classifiers in Malaita languages but have apparently been generalised to multiplicative classifiers in Makira. The cognate set reflecting &ast;sinola displays the lability which is typical of decimal systems of enumerative classifiers like that in [Table 14.9](#table-14.9) above.

### 6.5. Reconstructing classifiers in lower-order subgroups


The reconstructions below are restricted to certain subgroups, and reflect the fact that early in the history of each subgroup Admiralty, Kilivila-Muyuw and Micronesian languages expanded the repertoire of classifiers beyond those reconstructed for POc above.


<a id="s-6-6"></a>

### 6.6. Admiralties


Proto Admiralty (PAdm) has [NML]{.smallcaps}-[CLF]{.smallcaps} structure along with at least the following classifiers reconstructed above:

24) - PAdm _&ast;-(ə)fu_ default inanimate classifier (< POc _&ast;-pua_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PAdm _&ast;-kai_ ‘long rigid object; tree’ (< POc _&ast;-kai_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PAdm _&ast;-manu_ ‘animate’ (< POc _&ast;-manu_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PAdm _&ast;-kaba_ ‘flat object; leaf’ (< POc _&ast;-qapa_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PAdm _&ast;-buŋu_ ‘cluster, bundle (usually of fruit)’ (< POc _&ast;-buŋV_; [§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14))
    - PAdm _&ast;-iti_ ‘hand of bananas’ (< POc _&ast;-qiti_; [§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14))

The [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure was a variant of the POc &ast;[NML]{.smallcaps} _ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure, but by the breakup of PAdm, POc _&ast;ŋa_ had been lost, except as a fossil in PAdm _&ast;-ŋafulu_ ‘unit of 10’, _&ast;-ŋatu_ ‘unit of 100’ (below) and _&ast;-ŋafV_ ‘fathom’ ([§16.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-2-1#cldf:6-14)).

<a id="p-502"></a>

The first three cognate sets below are attributed to PAdm because they have reflexes from both Western (Wuvulu, Seimat) and Eastern Admiralty languages (the rest).

[PAdm &ast;_-potV_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-6-502-PAdm-potv-a)

For the four cognate sets below there is no Western Admiralty reflex. Three of them have a POc origin, but there is no way of knowing whether or not they became classifiers at a stage earlier than PAd.

### 6.7. Papuan Tip


PPT (PPT) had [CLF]{.smallcaps}-[NML]{.smallcaps} structure, along with at least the following classifiers reconstructed above:

25) - PPT _&ast;kai[u]-_ ‘default inanimate classifier (?); long rigid object; wooden thing’ (< POc
      _&ast;kai_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PPT _&ast;tau-_ ‘human; male human (?)’ (< POc _&ast;tau-_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PPT _&ast;manu-_ ‘animal’ (< POc _&ast;manu-_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PPT _&ast;waRo-_ ‘a bundle of coconuts’ (< POc (?) _&ast;waRo-_; [§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14))
    - PPT _&ast;ika-_ ‘10 of s.t.’ (< POc _&ast;ika-_; [§14.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-4#cldf:6-14))

The retention of a reflex of PPT _&ast;kai[u]-_ as either a fossil prefix or as one of very few classifiers in Central Papuan languages suggests that it may have been the default inanimate classifier in the shared ancestor of these languages, namely PPT. It was the odd one out among Oceanic subgroups in that it replaced the POc default inanimate classifier _&ast;pua-_ ([§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14)). The only groups of languages within Papuan Tip to retain more than a very few classifiers as part of a productive system are Kilivila–Muyuw ([Malinowski 1920](Source#cldf:Malinowski1920); Lawton, 1993; [Senft 1995](Source#cldf:Senft1995)) and Sudest–Nimoa ([Anderson & Ross 2002](Source#cldf:AndersonandRoss2002)).

### 6.8. Micronesian


Like Proto Admiralty, Proto Micronesian had [NML]{.smallcaps}-[CLF]{.smallcaps} structure. It retained from POc at least the following classifiers reconstructed above:

26) - PMic _&ast;-ua_ default numeral classifier (< POc _&ast;-pua_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-kai_ ‘plant, tree, stick’ (< POc _&ast;-kai_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-dau_ ‘animate; person’ (< POc _&ast;-tau_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-manu_ ‘animate’ (< POc _&ast;-manu_; [§14.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-1#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-bui_ ‘group, herd’ (< POc _&ast;-pui_; [§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-iti_ ‘hand of bananas’ (< POc _&ast;-qiti_; [§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-ik[a,e]_ ‘10 of s.t.’ (< POc _&ast;-ika_; [§14.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-4#cldf:6-14))
    - PMic _&ast;-ŋawulu_ ‘unit of ten’ (see below)

[PMic &ast;_-ŋawulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-8-504-PMic-awulu-a)

Micronesian also has a number of unit-of-measurement classifiers with reconstructions in Chapter 16:

27) - PMic _&ast;ŋafa_ ‘fathom’ PChk _&ast;yaŋa_ ‘finger span’
    - PCMic _&ast;-mʷanū_ ‘length from elbow to finger tips’
    - PChk _&ast;dila-wupʷa_ ‘distance from outstretched finger-tip to mid-chest (lit. ‘breast
      split’)
    - PMic _&ast;-mʷanū_ ‘length from elbow to finger tips’
    - PChk _&ast;makoto-ciki_ ‘length of one finger segments’
    - PChk _&ast;makoto-lapa_ ‘length of two finger segments’
    - Proto Chuukese _&ast;-tudu_ ‘finger-length’

The [NML]{.smallcaps} [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure was a variant of the POc [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure, but by the breakup of PMic, POc _&ast;ŋa_ had been lost, except as a fossil in PMic _&ast;-ŋawulu_ ‘unit of 10’ (above) and _&ast;-ŋafa_ ‘fathom’ ([§16.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-2-1#cldf:6-14)), and as a prenasalisation in PMic _&ast;-dau_ ‘animate; person’ and _&ast;-bui_ ‘group, herd’.

Although Nauruan is excluded from [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a) ([2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a))—presumably because its historical phonology remains almost unknown ([Nathan 1973](Source#cldf:Nathan1973); [Johnson 1999](Source#cldf:Johnson1999))—it is generally assumed that PMic and Nauruan form the primary branches of a ‘Greater Micronesian’ subgroup. If a classifier has a Nauruan reflex as well as reflexes from other Micronesian languages, that classifier can be attributed to Proto Greater Micronesian (PGMic).[^36] However, Nauruan historical phonology is so poorly understood that no attempt is made at PGMic reconstruction.


<a id="p-505"></a>

According to [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a) ([2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a):3), the internal classification of Micronesian languages other than Nauruan is as follows:

28) - _Micronesian_
      Kosraean
    - _Central Micronesian_
      Kiribati
    - _Western Micronesian_
      - Marshallese
      - _Ponapeic-Chuukic_
        - _Ponapeic_: Ponapean, Pingelapese, Mokilese
        - _Chuukic_: Chuukese, Puluwat, Mortlockese, Satawalese, Carolinian, Woleaian, Pulo Annian, Ulithian

Kosraean and Marshallese have all but lost their numeral classifiers. Their loss in Kosraean means that PMic classifiers cannot be reconstructed on the basis of internal evidence alone. If there is a Kiribati reflex, then a Proto Central Micronesian (PCMic) reconstruction can be made. Failing that—given the virtual absence of Marshallese classifiers—only a Proto Chuukic-Ponapeic (PPC) reconstruction can be made. If, on the other hand, there is a reflex of the classifier outside Micronesian, then a PMic reconstruction is possible.

Six classifiers with a Nauruan cognate can be reconstructed for PMic.

### 6.9. Polynesian


PPn retained both POc classifier structures, [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} and [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps}, but the classifier after _&ast;ŋa_ was always enumerative and denoted a multiple of the thing counted ([§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14)). [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) observes that the latter structure is rare in Tongic and East Polynesian languages. Unlike Admiralties and Micronesian languages, Polynesian languages use a classifier only with a restricted class of abundant and culturally significant items ([§14.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-3#cldf:6-14)).

Certain Tongan classifiers imply that Tongan retained a third POc classifier structure for which only sporadic evidence remains: [NML]{.smallcaps} + [CLF]{.smallcaps}-_&ast;qi_/_&ast;ni_, followed by the counted/ classified noun. This was an application of the POc specific possession structure ([Ross 1998b](Source#cldf:Ross1998b):249). The classifiers concerned are _-fo-ʔi_ ‘coconut’ and _-taua-ʔi_ ‘pair of coconuts’. The structure appears to be cognate with one found in SE Solomonic languages:

[6-14-6-9-507-47](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-14-6-9-507-47)

PPn retained the POc [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure along with at least the following classifiers reconstructed elsewhere:

30) - PPn _&ast;-fui_ ‘set of 5 pairs (of coconuts etc)’ ([§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14))
    - PPn _&ast;-fulu_ ‘unit of 10’ (< POc &ast;-puluq)

Supporting data for PPn _&ast;-fulu_ are shown in [Table 14.13](#table-14.13). Horizontal lines separate the Tongic languages from Samoic and Samoic from EPn. Hyphens indicate historic morpheme divisions, and not necessarily present ones. A dash indicates that the numeral does not reflect the PPn form. Luangiua _-hui_ reflects PPn _&ast;-fui_ ([§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14)), not _&ast;-fulu_, but the forms are included in the table because they illustrate the fact that _&ast;ŋa_ is sometimes absent after PPn _&ast;rua_ ‘2’ before classifiers other than _&ast;-fulu_.

Other reconstructable classifiers that occur in the same slot include PPn _&ast;-fua_ ‘10 of s.t.’. In Polynesian languages other than Tongan, it is _fua-_, rather than _-fua_, that marks a multiple of 10, but it is included here because it appears to be cognate with Wuvulu _-fua_ ‘10’, which reflects the [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_ [CLF]{.smallcaps} structure. It apparently reflects POc _&ast;-pua_ ‘default inanimate; round object’ but here has an enumerative or multiplicative function.

One other classifier that followed the numeral was PPn _&ast;-kau_. One of its meanings was ‘a score, 10 pairs’. It is not obvious how this relates to the Samoan and Rennellese glosses.

[PPn &ast;_-kau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-9-509-PPn-kau-a)

A number of other such classifiers are found in Tongan, Samoan and Rennellese, but they do not form cognate sets.

PPn retained the POc [CLF]{.smallcaps} [NML]{.smallcaps} structure along with at least PPn _&ast;mata-_ ‘10 fish; 10 taro’ ([§14.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-2#cldf:6-14)). One other preposed PPn classifier can be reconstructed. It appears only to have been used with the numerals 1–9.

[PPn &ast;_toka-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-14-6-9-509-PPn-toka-a)

This is the only preposed classifier that survives in EPn languages. As a result, the classifiers below, which have neither a Tongan nor an EPn reflex, must be attributed to Proto Samoic.

These preposed classifiers, all of which originally counted tens of something, inherited from Proto Samoic the odd feature noted by [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) that, when they count ‘one ten’ , ‘one’ is expressed by a reflex of Proto Samoic _&ast;-a-ŋa-fulu_, which includes the postposed classifier for ‘ten’. When they count from 2 upward, normal numerals are used. Hence, for example, Rennellese _tino aŋahugu_ ‘10 people’ but _tino gima_ ‘50 people’ (_gima_ ‘5’); Samoan _ʔau ŋa-ulu ufu_ ‘10 yams’ (_ʔau-_ ‘10 yams’; _ufu_ ‘yam’) but _ʔau-lua ufu_ ‘20 yams’ (_lua_ ’2’).

## 7. Conclusions


The main conclusion to be drawn from this chapter is that the inherited POc decimal system was fairly restricted in its use. Using simple numerals up to 100, one can construct complex numerals up to 999, and early Oceanic speakers skilled in counting could probably count far beyond this. Numbers up to 20 doubtless had limited everyday uses, but the system was mainly used by senior men to count produce of various kinds in wealth redistribution and exchange ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14).1). It is reasonably certain that only a small number of men in any community knew the community’s numeral system in detail, and the passing of such a large and complex system by a few men from generation to generation meant that it was prone to change, especially in the least used, i.e. the highest echelons, of the system ([§14.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-6#cldf:6-14)).

With one exception, reconstruction of POc decimal numerals is straightforward, and the reconstructions need not be repeated here. They are set out in [Table 14.1](#table-14.1) on [§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-14) and justified in sections 14.4.2 and 14.4.3 and their subsections. The exception is the numeral form for ‘one’. When it was attached to a classifier, its form was _&ast;sa-_. Unattached forms apparently included _&ast;(i)sa_, _&ast;ta-sa_, _&ast;tai_, _&ast;ta-kai_ and _&ast;sa-kai_ ([§14.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-1#cldf:6-14) and subsections). Why there are so many reconstructable forms is not known. Did they have different functions? Or were they the result of an emphatic forms meaning ‘one only’ becoming non-emphatic? What role, if any, did the POc dislike of single-syllable lexical morphemes play in their formation?


<a id="p-511"></a>

Inherited numerals containing the sequences _&ast;-[ŋa]puluq_ LIGATURE + ‘unit of ten’ and _&ast;-[ŋa]Ratus_ LIGATURE + ‘unit of hundred’ underwent various reanalyses in early Oceanic and point to the existence of dialects by the time POc broke up ([§14.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-5#cldf:6-14).2).

The inherited POc system also entailed the use of numeral classifiers in two constructions: NUMERAL [_&ast;ŋa_] CLASSIFIER and CLASSIFIER NUMERAL ([§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-14)). The only subgroup of Oceanic languages to retain both constructions with any degree of productivity is Polynesian ([§14.6.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-6-9#cldf:6-14)), and it is likely that, as with the few surviving Polynesian systems, the use of enumerative classifiers in POc was limited to nouns denoting culturally salient and abundant objects, rather than being used with all counted nouns as in Admiralties, Kilivila and Micronesian languages. Supporting evidence for this inference lies in the limited number of POc classifiers reconstructable (see below) and in the ease with which classifiers have been lost in many Oceanic languages. The Admiralties, Kilivila and Micronesian languages, on the other hand, represent an elaboration of the classifier system to cover all nouns. [Senft’s](Source#cldf:Senft1995) ([1995](Source#cldf:Senft1995)) work on Kilivila, where elaboration appears to be ongoing, implies that one reason for the elaboration is an appreciation of rhetoric in Kilivila society: subtle use of classifiers is one feature of a good public speech.

A complication here is that PPn classifiers with the structure [NML]{.smallcaps} _&ast;ŋa_-[CLF]{.smallcaps} always counted multiples of items, i.e. were always numeral classifiers. Was this true of their POc forebears? Quite possibly, but non-Polynesian data that would clinch this do not exist.

A question touched on only briefly in this chapter is whether digit tallying, i.e. counting on fingers and sometimes toes, already influenced numeral systems in early Oceanic times. This is the topic of the following chapter.

Appendix to chapter 14

This list contains references to sources of grammatical data, numerals and classifiers used in the present chapter and chapters 15 and 16 and not listed under sources of lexical data in Appendix A

Not listed below are the following. Many of the numeral forms from NCV languages of Malakula, Vanuatu, were collected by Aviva Shimelman in 2015–2016 under the aegis of the Vanuatu Languages and Lifeways project of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena. Many numeral forms and occasional information about classifier forms are found on the Institute’s website Numeral Systems of the World's Languages (https://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/channumerals/Austronesian-Eastern.htm) collated by Eugene Chan. Much of the data on numerals and classifiers in languages of Papua New Guinea is from Malcolm Ross’ fieldnotes, collected during the years 1978–1982.

## Notes

[^1]: My thanks go to the late John Lynch for providing the evidence noted in [§14.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-2#cldf:6-14).3.

[^2]:  The reader may object that a context where ‘six waters’ is not odd can easily be found, e.g., in a restaurant. This is a usage addressed by, e.g., [Lyons](Source#cldf:Lyons1977) ([1977](Source#cldf:Lyons1977):464), [Wiese & Maling](Source#cldf:WieseandMaling2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:WieseandMaling2005)), but is not relevant here.

[^3]: Other ethnographic accounts focus on exchange relations and do not mention counting, but at least where exchanges took place at feasts, counting was probably involved. Such accounts include [Aswani & Sheppard](Source#cldf:AswaniandSheppard2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:AswaniandSheppard2003)) on Roviana (MM), [Goodenough](Source#cldf:Goodenough1951) ([1951](Source#cldf:Goodenough1951):142) on Chuuk (Mic), and [Kaeppler](Source#cldf:Kaeppler1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Kaeppler1978)) on the Fiji–Tonga–Samoa exchange network.

[^4]: Hill & Unger use Lichtenberk’s term ‘numerically specific noun’. It is appropriate to To’aba’ita and Lengo, but not to languages where the ‘numerically specific’ (i.e. enumerative) item is not a noun.

[^5]: Medial _-h-_ of the Santa Isabel forms would reflect POc _&ast;-s-_. If the Niuean reflex were cognate with them, it too would retain _-h-_, but it doesn’t.

[^6]: The [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) glosses PMP _&ast;ŋa_ ‘linker for multiples of ten’, but its function was much wider: ‘ligature linking a numeral to a numeral classifier’.

[^7]: The origin of intrusive _ka-_ is not known.

[^8]:  _=puŋu_ ‘oblong object’; _-wala_ ‘thin flat object’.

[^9]:  Other than tens and hundreds, classifiers in Ponam and other Admiralties languages are not used with numerals above 4.

[^10]: Buli and Taba belong to the South Halmahera subgroup, Ambel and Magey Matbat to Raja Ampat. The SHWNG languages of Cenderawasih Bay have lost numeral classifiers.

[^11]: Sudest, Nimoa, Kilivila group, Central Papuan group.

[^12]: Nakanai, Buka/N Bougainville group.

[^13]: Data sources are [Churchward](Source#cldf:Churchward1953) ([1953](Source#cldf:Churchward1953):171–189) for Tongan, [Mosel & Hovdhaugen](Source#cldf:MoselandHovdhaugen1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:MoselandHovdhaugen1992):246–250) for Samoan, and [Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Elbert1988):186–200) for Rennellese.

[^14]: [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1966) ([1966](Source#cldf:Pawley1966):53) and [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999):197) treat PNPn _&ast;se_ ‘non-specific determiner’ as historically distinct from _&ast;sa_ ‘one’. Out of convenience Clark’s earlier hypothesis is adopted here.

[^15]: Where there is no note, this usually means that _&ast;lima_ in the sense of ‘hand, arm’ has been replaced by some other term.

[^16]: Uruava has lost both _&ast;s_ and _&ast;ŋ_, while Mono-Alu reflects _&ast;s_ as _l_ and has lost _&ast;ŋ_.

[^17]: [Owens & Lean](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:OwensandLean2018):157) quote [Codrington’s](Source#cldf:Codrington1885) ([1885](Source#cldf:Codrington1885):249–250) assumption that _-lau_/_-rau_ in the Malaita-Makira languages (here Longgu, Sa’a and Owa) is cognate with Fijian and Polynesian reflexes of PCP _&ast;rau_ ‘100’, and cite [Harrison & Jackson](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:HarrisonandJackson1984):69) in support of it. The sound correspondences among these languages (not accessible to Codrington) show this to be wrong, as Harrison & Jackson recognise. The Malaita-Makira forms are regular reflexes of POc _&ast;Ratus_ ‘100’. POc _&ast;R_ is reflected as Longgu/Sa’a _l_. If the Longgu/Sa’a form were cognate with PCP _&ast;rau_, the final syllable would be †_-rau_, not attested _-lau_.

[^18]: There are a number of languages with this template in SW Malakula where _&ast;saŋapulu_ is reflected with initial _l-_. This is an irregular reflex of currently unknown origin, and these languages are disregarded here.

[^19]: But Niuafo’ou numerals are likely to have been influenced by Tongan.

[^20]: The [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) reconstructs POc _&ast;ka-_ as an ordinal prefix, citing the Kiribati, Woleaian and Bauan reflexes above, with initial _i-_ omitted from the Bauan reflex.

[^21]: Data sources are: for Hawu, [Walker](Source#cldf:Walker1982) ([1982](Source#cldf:Walker1982)); for Kambera, [Klamer](Source#cldf:Klamer2010) ([2010](Source#cldf:Klamer2010)); for Lamaholot, [Nishiyama & Kelen](Source#cldf:NishiyamaandKelen2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:NishiyamaandKelen2007)); for Rongga, [Arka](Source#cldf:Arka2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Arka2008)); for Buru, [Grimes](Source#cldf:Grimes1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Grimes1991)); for Fehan Tetun, [van Klinken](Source#cldf:vanKlinken1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:vanKlinken1999)); for Nauete, [Schapper & Hammarström](Source#cldf:SchapperandHammarstrom2013) ([2013](Source#cldf:SchapperandHammarstrom2013)); for Buli, [Maan](Source#cldf:Maan1951) ([1951](Source#cldf:Maan1951)); for Taba, [Bowden](Source#cldf:Bowden2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Bowden2001)); for Ambai, [Silzer](Source#cldf:Silzer1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Silzer1983)).

[^22]: NE Ambae serial numerals are unprefixed.

[^23]: POLLEX reconstructs the PPn noun as _&ast;fuhi_, reflecting putative POc †_&ast;pusi_, but this is not warranted by reflexes of the noun that are listed in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) (e.g. Lau _fui_ ‘cluster, clump’).

[^24]: Griffin Point dialect, [Ray](Source#cldf:Ray1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:Ray1938)).

[^25]: The term ‘enumerative classifier’ occurs of necessity very frequently in this section, so the abbreviation EC is used in this section only.

[^26]: ECs counting taro are missing from the data for Fiji. ECs counting yams are missing from the data for the Bismarcks and NW Solomons. These may be accidental omissions from the data.

[^27]: Gaps in these distributions may reflect gaps in the data.

[^28]: [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) implies that _dumai_ ‘multiplicand 5’ may reflect _ruma_ ‘hand’ + _i_ ASSOC. _Ahusia_ ‘multiplicand 100,000’ means ‘piled up’ (from verb _ahu_ ‘pile up’). In terms with the multiplicand 50, _aba_ may be the term for ‘half’, i.e. ‘half a hundred’.

[^29]: In the first column, ‘20 or 25’ indicates a discrepancy in the sources. [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Fox1931)) gives _gagau_ as 25, whilst [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Fox1970), [1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) gives it as 20. The unit ‘2 yams etc’ in column 4 abbreviates ‘yams, taro, bananas, mangoes, stone’ [sic]. However, in E Arosi mangoes are not counted in pairs but single as in W Arosi. In the unit in column 5 ‘large teeth’ are large dogs’ teeth; ‘small teeth’ are small dogs’ teeth, bats' teeth or dolphins' teeth, all used as traditional money.

[^30]: The terms are _a evutu_ ‘a pair’, _a varivi_ ‘2 pairs’, _a kurene_ ‘3 pairs’, then _a taŋuani_ ‘2 kurene’, i.e. 12 coconuts, _a pakaruati_ ‘10 _taŋuani_’, i.e. 120 coconuts.

[^32]: [Bender & Beller](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:BenderandBeller2012)) have an alternative hypothesis. Writing about digit-tallying, they say, ‘Some systems don’t rely on 5 as a base when they have counted one hand, but instead switch between the two hands showing two threes for 6, two hands showing a three and a four for 7, two fours for 8. Systems like these are to be found in east Africa, with verbal counting using distinct lexemes for 1 to 5 but often composing higher numbers as 6 = 3 + 3 or 8 = 4 + 4. … This is perhaps the basis of Oceanic 3+3 and 4+4.’

[^33]: _kʷik_ may be omitted from 5, 6 and 7.

[^34]: See [§14.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-4-6#cldf:6-14) for the etymology of udol.

[^35]: Mussau is placed above PAdm as we assume it is perhaps coordinate with PAdm ([Figure 1.2](#fig-6-1_2)).

[^36]: [Blumenfeld](Source#cldf:Blumenfeld2022) ([2022](Source#cldf:Blumenfeld2022)) came to hand as final preparations for publication of the present volume were underway. He shows that there is no need to posit PGMic, as Nauruan is not a first-order subgroup of Micronesian.

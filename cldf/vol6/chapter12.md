## 1. Introduction[^1]


One thing people often talk about is what they and others say. When they talk about speech, they often conceptualise it as an act: ‘she promised me’ or ‘he accused me’ or ‘I reprimanded him’ or ‘he lied to me’ or ‘they congratulated you’ or ‘I persuaded her to …’. The list of possible ‘speech acts’ is long, and has generated a substantial literature. Much of this of a philosophical bent extending the work of [Austin](Source#cldf:Austin1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Austin1962)) and [Searle](Source#cldf:Searle1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Searle1969), [1976](Source#cldf:Searle1976), [1998](Source#cldf:Searle1998)). Some of it more inclined toward linguistics in that it deals with the pragmatics of speech—how we interpret and respond to what someone says (e.g., [Leech 1983](Source#cldf:Leech1983), ch.8; [Shuy 2015](Source#cldf:Shuy2015)), or with the structure of conversations (e.g., [Sinclair & Coulthard 1975](Source#cldf:SinclairandCoulthard1975); [Tsui 1994](Source#cldf:Tsui1994); [O’Grady 2010](Source#cldf:OGrady2010)).

Here, however, we set these matters aside and focus on speech act verbs, the verbs that speakers use to refer to the kinds of act exemplified above. Alongside these, languages have speech manner verbs like shout, stammer, and whisper, about which the literature has much less to say as they are relatively uncontroversial. Both speech act verbs and speech manner verbs are reconstructed below.

### 1.1. Categorising speech act verbs


A number of studies have examined the meanings of speech act verbs. [Verschueren](Source#cldf:Verschueren1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:Verschueren1980)) and [Wierzbicka](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1985a) ([1985a](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1985a), [1985b](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1985b), [2003](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka2003)) argue that we must not assume that each language encodes the same set of speech acts in its speech act verbs. Vershueren’s (1980:4) claim is that only the speech acts which are relevant within the given culture will be lexicalised (that is, have words or expressions that denote them) and thus the analysis of speech acts and their classification should be done through detailed analysis of different languages’ speech act verbs (Vershueren 1980:34). [Wierzbicka](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1987) ([1987](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1987), [2003](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka2003)) presents similar argumentation, stating that

> every language imposes a certain categorization on the universe of speech acts, by offering labels such as exclaim, promise, complain, reproach, and so on. These labels are language-specific. This means the categorization offered by one language is different from that offered by another ([Wierzbicka 1987](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1987):10).


<a id="p-370"></a>

She argues that these categorisations are ‘crucially important to the way we perceive the world we live in— the world of human relationships and human interaction.’ (1987:3). Further, “the primary act of speech act verbs consists in interpreting people’s speech acts, not in performing speech acts,” (1987:16) and thus

> The set of English speech act verbs reflects a certain interpretation of the world of human action and interaction’…‘but the categories for which English does provide names are evidently seen by the speakers of English as particularly important. They shape their perception of human attitudes and human relations ([Wierzbicka 1987](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1987):10).

Thus the only way to understand this categorisation in a given language and through it its speakers’ interpretations of human actions and interactions, is to first analyse the structure of its speech act verbs ([Wierzbicka 1987](Source#cldf:Wierzbicka1987):9).

Ideally, then, this chapter would pursue two questions: (i) What types of meaning are lexicalised in Oceanic languages and appear to have been lexicalised in Proto Oceanic; and (ii) what is the grammatical behaviour of these lexemes, both in the modern languages and in Proto Oceanic? However, the available data limit what can be done. Dictionary definitions of speech act verbs are often only one or two words, and we are left guessing how a term is/was used in practice. As a result there are more question marks against reconstructed glosses in this chapter than elsewhere in these volumes. Sometimes examples tell us about a term’s grammatical behaviour, but we find that cognates differ in behaviour, so that (ii) has proven largely unachievable, other than that the subject is usually the speaker.[^2]

Although absence of exact equivalence between speech act verbs in different languages is the norm, [Leech](Source#cldf:Leech1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Leech1983):205–226) sorts speech act verbs into five broad categories based on their sense and on the grammatical constructions in which they occur. We re-label four of them in order to avoid some of the jargon that has grown up around speech acts and speech act verbs.[^3] English constructions and examples follow.[^4] We take a following clause or _to_ + verb phrase to be the verb’s complement, while object<sub>A</sub> refers to an addressee. The morpheme introducing a complement is called a complementiser. In this terminology, then, _that_, _if_/ _whether_ and _to_ are complementisers.

1) a. report verbs (Leech’s assertives): e.g. _say_, _declare_, _argue_, _mention_
      - verb + object noun phrase            _I said a few words._
      - verb + [that] clause                 _I said that I was coming._
      - verb + clause with wh-word           _I said what they wanted to hear._
   b. question verbs (Leech’s rogatives), e.g. _ask_, _enquire_, _discuss_, _wonder_
      - verb + object noun phrase           _She asked a question._
      - verb + if/whether clause            _She asked if/whether the school would be closed._
      - verb + clause with wh-word          _She asked who would be invited._
   c. influence verbs[^5] (Leech’s directives), e.g. _tell_, _urge_, _order_, _request_, _ask_
      - verb + objectA + [that] clause      _I told the children that they should go home._
      - verb + objectA + to verb phrase     _I told the children to go home._
   d. commitment verbs (Leech’s commissives), e.g. _offer_, _promise_, _agree_, _refuse_
      - verb + [that] clause           _We agreed that we would paint the schoolroom._
      - verb + to verb phrase          _We agreed to paint the schoolroom._


<a id="p-371"></a>

Influence constructions resemble commitment constructions, except for the addition of an addressee object (the person the speaker seeks to influence) in influence constructions.

Semantic definitions of the four classes in (1) are inevitably wide. Report verbs refer to speech acts by which speakers convey the information in the complement to their addressee(s) ([§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12)). A question verb refers to a speech act that seeks from some other person a verbal response to the complement ([§12.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-3#cldf:6-12)). An influence verb refers to a speech act that seeks to have the addressee(s) perform an act described in the complement ([§12.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-4#cldf:6-12)). A commitment verb refers to a speech act whereby the speaker(s) undertakes to perform (or in the case of refuse, not to perform) an act described in the complement. No commitment verbs are reconstructed below, a lacuna that is discussed in [§12.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-5#cldf:6-12).

Leech’s expressives, e.g. _greet (s.o.)_, _thank (s.o. for s.t.)_, _excuse (s.o. from s.t.)_, _accuse (s.o. of s.t.)_, _praise (s.o. for s.t.)_, _congratulate (s.o. on s.t.)_, _apologise (to s.o. for s.t.)_ differ from report verbs in that they usually occur without a complement clause because the speech act’s semantic content is expressed by the speech act verb itself ([Leech 1983](Source#cldf:Leech1983):217–218). Expressives are particularly specific to their speakers’ culture in the sense discussed by Verschueren and Wierzbicka, but we do find a few cognate sets that permit the reconstruction of earlier expressive speech act verbs ([§12.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4#cldf:6-12)).

In both English and many Oceanic languages the same verb may occur in different constructions with different meanings. _Tell_, for example, is both a report and an influence verb. The distinction is made by the complement construction: report _I told him that I was going home_ vs influence _I told them that they should go home_ or _I told them to go home_. Ask is both a question and an influence verb: _We asked if the school would be closed_ vs _We asked the children to go home_. Thus it is the verb and the construction together that convey whether the speech act being talked about is conceived as reporting, questioning, influencing or committing.[^6]

In light of the above, data for this chapter were assembled in two ways. First, as usual, we searched all the available lexical sources for speech act and speech manner verbs. We also searched grammatical descriptions for examples of speech act verb usage in the context of the constructions with which they occur. Examples from sixty or so Oceanic languages were collected, but these are sometimes incomplete. Often we do not find construction data for commitment verbs. This is apparently a result of the distribution of the four classes in the data. Where ‘>’ means ‘is more frequent than’, we find report > influence > question > commitment.

### 1.2. Complements in Oceanic languages


The framework above seems messy: a few English speech act verbs belong to two or more of the four classes, and some English constructions occur in more than one class. The apparent mess reflects the interaction of numerous factors which we gloss over here. What is interesting is that each Oceanic language for which there are adequate data on the co-occurrence of constructions with speech act verbs displays a similar set of overlaps. Just as the complementiser that occurs with English report, influence and commitment verbs, in Sursurunga (MM, St George, south New Ireland) the complementiser _ŋo_ occurs with all four classes. And just as a conditional _should_ or _would_ occurs in the _that_-complement of an English influence or commitment verb, so the verb in the complement of a Sursurunga influence or commitment verb is in the irrealis mood, as in (5) and (6). We saw from (1c) and (1d) above that English influence and commitment constructions differ only in the addition of an addressee object to influence constructions, an addition that follows from their semantics. The same difference is reflected in (5) and (6) below.

In each of (2) to (6) the speech act verb is underlined and the complement clause is surrounded by square brackets. The complementiser is bolded.

[6-12-1-2-372-2](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-372-2)

[6-12-1-2-372-3](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-372-3)

[6-12-1-2-372-4](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-372-4)

[6-12-1-2-372-6](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-372-6)

Another instance of similarity between English and Oceanic is that some speech act verbs occur in more than one category. English tell and Wayan Fijian _veðe_ ‘tell’ both occur as both report (7) and influence (8) verbs


<a id="p-373"></a>

[6-12-1-2-373-7](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-373-7)

[6-12-1-2-373-8](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-373-8)

The same can be said of Mussau _ue_, Wuvulu _-ware_, Lou _pa_, Kele _pe_, Mangap _-so_, Bariai _-keo_, Yabem _-sʊm_, Minaveha _-vone_, Tawala _-baha_, ’Ala’ala _-tani-_, Bola _taki-_, Nakanai _vei_, Tabar _oeŋ_, Siar _war-_, Halia _hate-_, Teop _sue_, Papapana _-vatani-_, Zabana _kahe-_, Kokota _ōe_, Maringe _ceke-_, Gela _bosa_, Tolo _koe_, Longgu _ili-_, Arosi _woi_, Teanu _-ko_, Vurës _ɣaɣnɛɣ_, Mwotlap _vap_, Maskelynes _-kel_, Tamambo _viti-_, NE Ambae _veve_, Neverver _-ver_, Paamese _vite_, Lewo _-pisa_, Nêlêmwa _xabʷe_, Tinrin _hĩḍɔ_, Kosraean _fæk_, Marshallese _ciṛoŋ_, Mokilese _pʷēŋ_, Boumaa Fijian _tuʔu-_, Tongan _tala_, Tuvalu _fai_. The fact that the same word can be used with both report and influence constructions in so many Oceanic languages points to the likelihood that POc also had verbs similar in sense to English _tell_, meaning roughly ‘communicate (s.t. to s.o.)’. Two such verbs are tentatively reconstructed in [§12.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-2#cldf:6-12). But the fact that the just listed verbs form a number of cognate sets (or belong to no known set) is a warning that speech act verbs are quite labile in Oceanic languages.

Of all these verbs, just two also occur as question verbs: Tawala _baha_ and Boumaa Fijian _tuʔu_, probably because they are general verbs of saying.

Although English _ask_ occurs as both a question and an influence verb, the only clear Oceanic instances of this semantic range in our data are Micronesian: Kosraean _siyʌk_, Marshallese _kaccitʌk_. This is not really surprising, as English _ask_ is unusual in this regard. Many languages, it seems, use different speech act verbs in contexts that approximately correspond to English _ask_, e.g. German _fragen_ (question) vs _bitten_ (influence), Spanish _preguntar_ vs _rogar_, Russian _sprosit’_ vs _poprosit’_, Hungarian _kérdezni_ vs _kérni_ ([Verschueren 1980](Source#cldf:Verschueren1980):27), Japanese _tazuneru_ vs _tamomu_, Mandarin _wèn_ vs _yào_.[^7] Note, however, that there is a derivational relationship between the two verbs in Russian and in Hungarian.

One difference between English and many Oceanic languages resides in the fact that English question, influence and commitment verbs have an alternative construction, _to_ + verb phrase. This is an instance of “desententialisation” ([Lehmann 1988](Source#cldf:Lehmann1988)), the tendency across languages for non-report verbs to occur with reduced complements that are no longer sentence-like. Like Sursurunga in (2)–(6), most Oceanic languages appear to lack reduced complements. Of the sixty or so Oceanic languages examined, only four have them. One is Teop (MM, Northwest Solomonic, north Bougainville), where influence verbs occur with two constructions. In (9) the complement clause is marked with the imperative preverbal clitic _=re_, and is a full clause. Alone, but with a second-person plural pronoun, its clause would be an imperative: ‘You go to the garden!’.

[6-12-1-2-373-9](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-373-9)


<a id="p-374"></a>

In (10) the complement is reduced: the complementiser is purposive tea and the subject is deleted as it is identical with the addressee (_mōn_ ‘female’) of the influence verb _sue_ ‘tell’.

[6-12-1-2-374-10](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-2-374-10)

Other languages in which we have found reduced complements are Wayan Fijian (see example 8), Kosrean ([Lee 1975](Source#cldf:Lee1975):307) and Mokilese ([Harrison 1976](Source#cldf:Harrison1976):293–294).[^8]

English and Oceanic complement clauses differ in another respect. It is well known that the complements of English speech verbs (‘indirect speech’) are potentially affected by two phenomena relative to the clauses they are allegedly quoting. Thus a direct quotation like _‘I don’t want to be here,’ John said_ becomes _John <ins>said</ins> [he didn’t want to be there]_. The first phenomenon is deictic shift. As the speaker of the latter sentence is not John and is not at the place where John had spoken, the _I_ of direct quotation becomes _he_ and _here_ becomes _there_. The second phenomenon is tense shift. As the speech act verb _said_ of the latter sentence is in the past tense, the present tense verb _don’t want_ of direct quotation shifts tense to past _didn’t want_. Oceanic languages employ deictic shift, but to our knowledge none shift tense. This appears to be a common pattern around the world.

It should be noted here that in Oceanic narrative texts direct quotation is much more common than indirect speech.

### 1.3. Ways of referring to speech acts


Thus far, we have assumed that speech acts are referred to by dedicated verbs, and indeed sometimes they are, as shown by the reconstructions in the following sections. But languages differ in this regard. For example, Mangap (NNG) has numerous apparent compounds that refer to speech acts. These consist of a verb plus an element that may be an adverb, a noun or another verb. The dictionary usually treats an adverb or noun as a separate word but joins a second verb to the first as a single word.[^9] Some of these compounds are semantically quite transparent, especially those with adverbs, e.g. _-so katkat_ ‘speak frankly’, where _-so_ means ‘say, speak’ and _katkat_ means ‘openly, directly’. Others are fairly opaque, like _-so-pe_ ‘advise (s.o.), instruct (s.o.)’, where _-pe_ is ‘be firm, be settled’. Further compounds with _-so_ are shown in (11).

11)

| Compound     | gloss                             | second element   | with gloss                |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| _-so katkat_ | ‘speak frankly’                   | _katkat_         | ‘openly, directly’        |
| _-so sorok_  | ‘speak baselessly’                | _sorok_          | ‘insignificant, ordinary’ |
| _-so-kāla_   | ‘cut s.o.’s talk short’           | _-kāla_          | ‘go on top of’            |
| _-so-pe_     | ‘advise (s.o.), instruct (s.o.)’  | _-pe_            | ‘be firm, be settled’     |
| _-so-kere_   | ‘talk s.o. into doing s.t. wrong’ | _-kere_          | ‘lead, take the lead’     |
| _-so-yāra_   | ‘speak publicly, proclaim’        | _-yāra_          | ‘shine, give off light’   |


<a id="p-375"></a>

The compounds above are report or influence expressions. Compounds formed with _wi-_ ‘ask’ are question expressions, as seen in (12). Alone, _-wi_ A _pa_ B (_pa_ is a multipurpose preposition) means either ‘ask A about B’ or ‘ask A for B’.

12)

| Compound    | gloss                                             | second element   | with gloss            |
|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| -wi kankāna | ‘ask stupid questions, ask a rhetorical question’ | kankāna          | ‘stupid’              |
| -wi kinkin  | ‘interrogate, persist in asking’                  | kinkin           | ‘persistently’        |
| -wi tapāra  | ‘ask repeatedly’                                  | -tapāra          | ‘repeatedly’          |
| -wi-sese    | ‘interrogate, ask repeatedly’                     | -sese            | ‘sew up, mend’        |
| -wi-nanāna  | ‘investigate, ask many people’                    | -nanāna          | ‘chase’               |
| -wi-pe      | ‘ask in order to hear well’                       | -pe              | ‘be firm, be settled’ |

A number of other speech act compounds are listed in (13). The first verb is one of _-suŋ_, _-kuru_ and _-ŋgal_. Alone _-suŋ A pa B_ means ‘ask A for B’. The other two verbs are not speech act verbs when used alone: _-kuru_ means ‘thread (s.t.) through a hole, put into a container’, and _-ŋgal_ ‘throw’ or ‘pierce’.

13)

| Compound         | gloss                                              | second element   | with gloss    |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| _-suŋ sosor_     | ‘wish evil, threaten, curse’                       | _sosor_          | ‘wrongdoing’  |
| _-kuru kopo-_    | ‘stir up, incite, provoke (s.o.)’                  | _kopo-_          | ‘stomach’     |
| _-kuru lele-_    | ‘stir up, incite, provoke (s.o.)’                  | _lele-_          | ‘inside’      |
| _-kuru sua pa_ A | ‘accuse A falsely’                                 | _sua_            | ‘talk (N)’    |
| _-ŋgal sua pa_ A | ‘accuse A (often falsely)’ (= ‘throw talk at’)     | _sua_            | ‘talk (N)’    |
| _-ŋgal lele-_    | ‘speak publicly, proclaim’ (= ‘pierce the inside’) | _lele-_          | ‘inside (N)’  |
| _-ŋgal talŋa-_   | ‘tell a secret, tip off’ (= ‘pierce the ears’)     | _talŋa-_         | ‘ear’         |
| _-ŋgal-rāma_     | ‘teach (s.o.), instruct (s.o.)’                    | _rāma_           | ‘be together’ |
| _-ŋgal-sek pa_ A | ‘forbid someone from doing s.t.’                   | _-sek_           | ??            |

Among the expressions in (13) is (in two versions), _-kuru/-ŋgal sua pa A_ ‘accuse A falsely’. It includes the noun _sua_ ‘talk’. Mangap has many speech act expressions that include _sua_, and a sample is listed in (14).

| _-ur sua pa_ A          | ‘order A, command A’          | ‘put talk to A’              |
| _-piri sua pa_ A        | ‘curse A, speak badly to A’   | ‘toss (bad) talk at A’       |
| _-gībi sua pa_ A        | ‘curse A, speak badly to A’   | ‘throw talk at A’            |
| _-suk sua pa_ A         | ‘accuse A’                    | ??                           |
| _-tōro sua_             | ‘speak figuratively’          | ‘turn talk’                  |
| _-kam sua pa_ A         | ‘rebuke A, exhort A’          | ‘do talk to/about A’         |
| _-kam sua bōzo pa_ A    | ‘complain about A’            | ‘do a lot of talk about A’   |
| _-mbuk sua pa_ A _pa_ B | ‘promise A concerning B’      | ‘tie talk to A concerning B’ |
| _-la sua lelē-ne_       | ‘have an in-depth discussion’ | ‘go (to) the talk's inside’  |
| _-so le-A sua_          | ‘have a chat with A’          | ‘say A's talk’               |


<a id="p-376"></a>

The last entry above perhaps needs explanation. The noun _sua_ ‘talk’ is indirectly possessed, that is, the possessor suffix is attached not to the possessed noun _sua_ but to the possessive classifier _le-_ to give _le-n sua_ ‘their talk’ in (15).[^10]

[6-12-1-3-376-11](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-1-3-376-11)

Finally, (13) includes four body-part expressions, _-kuru kopo-_ ‘stir up, incite, provoke (s.o.)’, _-kuru lele-_ ‘stir up, incite, provoke (s.o.)’, _-ŋgal lele-_ ‘speak publicly, proclaim’, _ŋgal talŋa-_ ‘tell a secret, tip off’, which include the body-part terms _kopo-_ ‘stomach’, _lele-_ ‘inside’ and _talŋa-_ ‘ear’. Body-part terms play a large role in denoting emotions in Oceanic languages ([vol.5, ch.9](ContributionTable#cldf:5-9)), and—not unexpectedly—Mangap _kʷo-_ ‘mouth’ figures in a number of speech act expressions. Some of these appear in (16).

The grammar of these expressions is straightforward. The noun _kʷo-_ ‘mouth’ essentially stands in for the speaker, so that in (17) _kʷo-ŋ_ [mouth-P:1S] ‘my mouth’ stands in for ‘I’. As the subject of the clause is ‘my mouth’, the verb takes a third person singular subject coreferencing prefix i-.

The distribution across Oceanic languages of compounds like those in Mangap is impossible to ascertain, as typically neither dictionaries nor grammars pay much attention to them. However, Lewo (NCV) makes plentiful use of speech act compounds that resemble those in (11) and (12). These are described by [Early](Source#cldf:Early1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:Early1993)), and (18) gives a selection of his examples.[^11]

Motu (PT) _gʷau_ ‘say, speak’ behaves like Lewo visa ‘say’, as a glance at Lister-Turner & Clark’s (1954) dictionary shows. Wayan Fijian _tata_ ‘say, speak’ behaves similarly, as shown by the examples from [Pawley & Sayaba’s](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022) ([2022](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022)) dictionary listed in (19).

However, one cannot assume that all Oceanic languages function like Mangap or Lewo. A search of the Wayan dictionary suggests that not many Wayan speech act verbs behave like this. Instead, there are many different lexical verbs, and the language also employs derivational affixes to produce verbs with senses that are sometimes not predictable from the root. Thus _tata_ occurs in a basic transitive _tata-ni-_ ‘speak to (s.o.)’, an applicative _tata-takini-_ ‘talk about (s.t), complain or speak angrily about (s.t.)’, a reciprocal _vī-tata-ni_ ‘converse, talk to one another’, and a frequentative _tātata_, ‘talk a lot, be talkative’. The verb _kʷai_ ‘say (s.t.), mention (s.t.)’ (transitive: _kʷaya_) appears not to occur in compound expressions, but only in derived forms: the frequentatives _kʷakʷai_ (transitive: _kʷakʷaiti-_) ‘gossip (about s.o.), talk critically or slanderously about s.o. in their absence’ and _kʷaya-kʷaya_ ‘keep mentioning (s.t.), keep talking about (s.t.)’. The same is evidently true of _rō_ (transitive: _rōti-_) ‘send a request to s.o. (asking for s.t.), give information to s.o.’ with its derived forms _vaka-roti-_ ‘go and tell (s.o.)’ (_vaka-_ causative) and _vīrōroti_ ‘invite or summon people, bring in or gather people or animals’. Similar derivations occur with many other speech verbs.

## 2. Reconstructing Oceanic speech act and speech manner verbs


Various obstructions stand in the way of speech act verb reconstruction. One is their lability, ([§12.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-2#cldf:6-12)). Another is that reconstructions are often difficult to gloss. This, too, is partly due to lability: the meaning of a POc speech verb’s reflexes can change considerably as one moves eastward. But, more importantly, it is because many sources gloss them too briefly, leaving us with no information as to which class(es) of speech act verb a verb belongs to or, if the verb is transitive, whether its object is the speaker’s addressee or an indirect speech complement or a piece of direct speech ([§12.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-1#cldf:6-12)). Reconstructing POc usage is thus fraught with uncertainties.

One development that occurs at various times and places in the development of Oceanic speech act verbs is the occasional grammaticalisation of one of these verbs as a complementiser.

The first stage in this development is represented by Paamese (NCV). In (20) the verb _-vit_ ‘say’ functions as a report verb. In (21) it is the second verb of a serial verb construction that consists of the question verb _-vīsi-_ ‘ask (s.o a question)’ and _-vit_ ‘say’. Here _-vit_ simply has the function of introducing the complement clause, but it is syntactically a verb, as it takes a subject prefix (‘they asked me … they said…’).

[6-12-2-None-378-13](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-2-None-378-13)

[6-12-2-None-378-14](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-2-None-378-14)

Nêlêmwa (NCal) represents the second step. In (22) the verb xabʷe ‘say’ functions as a report verb and is preceded by a subject pronoun.

[6-12-2-None-378-15](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-2-None-378-15)

In (23), _xabʷe_ follows the verb fāɣēn ‘ask’, but this is no longer a serial construction like (21), as xabʷe has lost its subject pronoun and become grammaticalised as a complementiser. Example (24) confirms this nicely, as it contains the verb _i u xabʷe_ ‘he said’ and then the complementiser _xabʷe_ that no longer has semantic function, only the syntactic function of introducing the complement.

<a id="p-379"></a>

[6-12-2-None-379-17](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-2-None-379-17)

A third stage in this development occurs when a complementiser is phonologically reduced. Some of these appear in the cognate sets below.


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Complement-taking speech act verbs


Reflexes of the report, question, influence and commitment verbs reconstructed in §[§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12)–12.3.5 are commonly found with an indirect speech complement, as described in [§12.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1#cldf:6-12), and one may infer that this was also true of the reconstructed verbs.

Some of the POc report verbs reconstructed below were very probably also used in senses that went beyond their speech act senses. Data supporting this inference are given in [§12.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-6#cldf:6-12).


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Report verbs


We infer from the glosses in the cognate sets below that POc _&ast;kʷa_/_&ast;kʷai-_ and _&ast;pʷa_/_&ast;pʷai-_, both ‘say, tell’, were perhaps the most neutral POc report verbs. Their similarity in form is probably fortuitous, and we see no difference in reconstructable meaning. Reflexes of both are well distributed across Oceania, although there are areas where one or the other predominates: _&ast;kʷa_/_&ast;kʷai_ in Guadalcanal (SES), in northern Vanuatu and in Fiji; _&ast;pʷa_/_&ast;pʷai_ in Western Oceanic, in Malaita (SES), in central Vanuatu and in Polynesia. The two coexist in Micronesia.

Some of the reflexes of both verbs are complementisers, glossed simply with (C). We infer that complementisers of the form _ka_ reflect intransitive _&ast;kʷa_, while those of the form _ke_ reflect transitive _&ast;kʷai-_. A parallel observation applies to complementiser reflexes of _&ast;pʷa_/_&ast;pʷai-_, but with complications due to the reflexes of _&ast;pʷ-_, which are discussed in connection with POc _&ast;pʷaca(q)_ below. Maskelynes _ke_, true to the description in [§12.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-2#cldf:6-12), is an instance of a form that survives as both a verb and a complementiser, like Nêlêmwa _xabʷe_ in (23) and (24). The same is true of NE Ambae _-vo_ and Mafea _-v_.

Just a few reflexes of _&ast;kʷa_, _&ast;kʷai-_ appear also to be influence verbs, either because their glosses show this (Arosi, Kosaean, Rotuman) or because we have influence examples (Vurës). Similarly there are influence examples of reflexes of _&ast;pʷa_, _&ast;pʷai-_ (Tolai, Papapana, Mwotlap, Kosraean and Marshallese). These seem to be an extensions of the use of a ‘say’ verb in various languages rather than a feature reconstructable to POc.

POc _&ast;kʷa_ was inherited from a PMP form which [Reid](Source#cldf:Reid2012) ([2012](Source#cldf:Reid2012)) writes _&ast;kuwá_, with final stress. It is easy to see that this might have been pronounced _&ast;kʷa_.

[PAn &ast;_kuaS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-379-POc-ka-a)


<a id="p-380"></a>

It is tempting to associate POc _&ast;pʷa_/_&ast;pʷai-_ ‘say, tell’ with _&ast;[pʷa]pʷa(q)_ ‘inner mouth’ ([vol.5:128](ContributionTable?anchor=p-128#cldf:5-3)), but it seems more probable that this is a chance resemblance. The earliest convincing ancestor of _&ast;pʷa_/_&ast;pʷai-_ is reconstructable as PCEMP _&ast;bai_ ‘say’. Non-Oceanic evidence for the latter consists of PCMP _&ast;bei_ ‘say’ (ACD) and PSHNG _&ast;ba_/_&ast;be_.[^13]


<a id="p-381"></a>

The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ are probably reduplications of reflexes of _&ast;pʷa_ and _&ast;pʷai-_.

[PCEMP &ast;_bai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-381-POc-pa-a)


<a id="p-382"></a>

POc _&ast;pʷaca(q)_, _&ast;pʷaca(q)i-_ ‘speak, say’ appears to have been a straightforward report verb. The near-absence of ‘tell’ from the glosses of its reflexes suggests that it it was not used as an influence verb. Exceptions are the Tawala transitive form _bahe-_ and Gela _bosa-_, which are recorded in both report and influence constructions.

Intransitive _&ast;pʷaca(q)_ may have been used in the sense of ‘speak’, i.e. to denote the act of speaking. The glosses of the Tawala, Gela, Longgu, Chuukese and Boumaa Fijian reflexes suggest that this POc form was also used as a noun meaning ‘word, speech, language’.

The reconstruction of the POc consonant _&ast;pʷ_ is discussed in [vol.1:16](ContributionTable?anchor=p-16#cldf:1-2), and it has since been investigated in some detail by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e)). Its rarity of occurrence means that its reflexes have not been fully formulated. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e) ([2002e](Source#cldf:Lynch2002e):337) finds that it is in any case unstable. The sequence _&ast;pʷa_ often becomes _&ast;po_ or _&ast;bo_, or simply _&ast;pa_, and it is a combination of these reflexes that points to POc _&ast;pʷa_, as Lynch’s examples show. This is also true of the cognate set below.

Given the overall rarity of forms in POc _&ast;pʷa-_, one wonders whether there is a historical connection between _&ast;pʷaca(q)_ below and _&ast;pʷa_ above, but if there is, it probably lies too far back in time to be elucidated.


<a id="p-383"></a>

[PAn &ast;_bajaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-383-POc-pacaq-a)

Cognate sets supporting the reconstructions below are far more limited than those above, and the data do not show whether these were complement-taking verbs.

The distribution of reflexes of _&ast;bʷala_ ‘say, speak’ is sufficient to support a POc reconstruction.

[POc &ast;_bʷala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-383-POc-bala-a)

It is possible that PWOc _&ast;sowa_, _&ast;sowai-_ ‘say, speak’ was a reflex of PMP _&ast;sau_ ‘word; talk; conversation; language’ (ACD). Although the ACD’s gloss classes this as a noun, its non-Oceanic reflexes show that it was also a verb root.

[PWOc &ast;_sowa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-383-PWOc-sowa-a)


<a id="p-384"></a>

The cognate set supporting PEOc _&ast;bata_ ‘speak, utter’ is entirely from [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003b) ([2003b](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003b)).

[PEOc &ast;_bata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-1-384-PEOc-bata-a)


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Report/influence verbs


The reconstructed forms in this section appear to have been used both as report verbs and as influence verbs, as described in [§12.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1#cldf:6-12).

The most widely reflected of these is POc _&ast;waRa_, _&ast;waRai-_ ‘say (to s.o.), tell (s.o.)’. The Mussau, Wuvulu (Adm) and Siar (MM) reflexes are known to be used as both report and influence verbs, the Araki (NCV) reflex as an influence verb, and the Mafea (NCV) reflex as a report verb. In Araki and NE Ambae the object is the addressee. In Mussau and Wuvulu the object is the complement. In Siar the object is the complement when _warai_ is used as a report verb but the addressee when it is used as an influence verb. We have inferred that POc _&ast;waRai-_ behaved like Siar, as the other configurations can be derived from it via analogy, but this is weak evidence.

This verb was evidently already present in PEMP, as there is an EMP reflex, Dusner (CB) _vre_ ‘say’.

[POc &ast;_waRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-2-384-POc-wara-a)


<a id="p-385"></a>

It is difficult to see a difference in meaning between POc _&ast;pʷiti((r,R))_, _&ast;pʷiti((r,R))i-_ ‘say (s.t.), tell (s.o. to do s.t.)’ below and POc _&ast;waRa_, _&ast;waRai-_ above. Evidence that the former was used as both a report and an influence verb is relatively strong. Its reflexes in Buma, Tamambo, Paamese and Tirax are all used as both. Its reflexes in Mangap, Sursurunga and Vinitiri are used as influence verbs, those in Tolai and Lewo as report verbs.

The POc form was apparently inherited from PEMP, as there is a cognate in the Raja Ampat language Biga (= Misool), namely _bitino_ ‘say’. As usual, the parentheses around stem-final _&ast;r_, _&ast;R_ indicate that we cannot tell whether the POc consonant was _&ast;r_ or _&ast;R_. The extra set of parentheses says that, as we have only reflex, Minigir _vitiri_, the presence of the stem-final consonant is uncertain.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Question verbs


Somewhat surprisingly only three high-order question verbs can be reconstructed, one each for POc, PWOc and PEOc. Why so few? In our construction data there are a number of languages for which we found no examples of indirect questions, probably because indirect speech is infrequent in texts, and indirect questions are rarer than report or influence constructions. On the other hand our search for question verbs in lexical sources found plenty, but they do not form cognate sets. How is this explained? Words that are less frequently used are replaced more rapidly than more frequently used words, and this is perhaps why there are so few question verb reconstructions, and why the reconstructions that can be inferred have relatively few reflexes.

A single question verb is tentatively reconstructed to POc, _&ast;nanasa_, _&ast;nanasai-_ ‘ask’. Its question verb reflexes are restricted to WOc, as the Arosi reflex is not a question verb.

[POc &ast;_nanasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-3-386-POc-nanasa-a)


<a id="p-387"></a>

It is hard to be sure of the meaning of PWOc _&ast;tore_. Only the Lukep and Iduna reflexes are question verbs. The reflexes in the close relatives Maringe and Kokota are influence verbs, but this is not completely surprising, as the shift from ‘ask a question’ via ‘ask whether s.o. will do s.t.’ (still a question) to ‘ask s.o. to do s.t.’ (an influence construction) is intuitively quite probable, even if infrequent (see [§12.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-2#cldf:6-12)). The shift to a report verb in Notsi, however, is curious, but we would need far more than the available data in order to elucidate this.

If the Kwaio form reflects _&ast;to(r,R)e_, then the reconstruction is promoted to POc.

[PWOc &ast;_tore_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-3-387-PWOc-tore-a)

PEOc _&ast;vaizu_/_&ast;vaizuni-_ is a more solid reconstruction than either of those above.

[PEOc &ast;_vaizu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-3-387-PEOc-vaizu-a)

To the three reconstructions above, we add the following cognate set, but make no reconstruction, as there is a semantic mismatch between the three MM languages clustered around the St George Channel between southern New Ireland and northeastern New Britain, and the Malaita-Makira languages (SES). Reflexes in the St George languages are all glossed ‘ask’, whereas those in the Malaita-Makira languages are all report verbs. We are encouraged to think that they may reflect PSES _&ast;tili-_ by the fact that the one NCV reflex is also a report verb. This would allow us to reconstruct a POc speech act verb _&ast;tiRi-_, but what exactly would it mean?

[6-12-3-3-387-mm-ramoaaina-tiri](cf.csv#cldf:6-12-3-3-387-mm-ramoaaina-tiri)


<a id="p-388"></a>

It is not clear whether PNCV _&ast;usi-_ meant ‘ask (a question)’ or ‘ask (s.o. for s.t.)’. As noted above, the shift from ‘ask (a question)’ to ‘ask (s.o. for s.t.)’ is probable. A shift in the opposite direction seems less likely, so PNCV _&ast;usi_ is included here rather than in [§12.3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-4#cldf:6-12).

[PNCV &ast;_usi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-3-388-PNCV-usi-a)

PPn had two question verbs that are reflected across the whole subgroup: _&ast;huqi_ ‘ask (a question)’ and _&ast;sili_ ‘ask questions’.

### 3.4. Influence verbs


It was noted in [§12.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-2#cldf:6-12) that there appear to have been POc verbs that served as both report and influence verbs. We also mentioned in [§12.3.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-3#cldf:6-12) that some question verbs meaning ‘ask (s.o. a question)’ seem to have had the influence sense ‘ask (s.o. to do s.t.)’. This leaves only a few other influence verbs, all meaning ‘ask s.o. for s.t.’, ‘ask s.o. to give self s.t.’.

The two sets supporting POc _&ast;noŋi_ and PEOc _&ast;noqi_ below entail some formal puzzles. In fact, we infer that they have a single origin, but we have few data to undergird this inference.

The regular reflex of PMP _&ast;ŋeni_ is POc _&ast;ŋoni_, but the latter is reflected only in Labu and in an alternant Arosi form. All other Oceanic forms reflect a metathesised _&ast;noŋi_, the form reconstructed by [Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1968) ([1968](Source#cldf:Milke1968)). We surmise with Blust (ACD) that Arosi _ŋoni_ may be a chance (re)metathesis.

The second set, reflecting putative PEOc _&ast;noqi_, is suspect on two grounds. First, it is reflected only in Guadalcanal (in Ghari and Tolo) and in Pn languages. Gela, in the same major subgroup within SES as Ghari and Tolo, reflects _&ast;noŋi_. Second, the Ghari and Tolo forms are not regular cognates of PPn _&ast;noqi_. The expected cognate form is †_noɣi_ or †_noi_.

A possible explanation of the the Ghari and Tolo forms is that speakers reanalysed reflexes of _&ast;noŋi_ as transitives. In many EOc languages the transitive is marked by _-Ci_, where _C_ is one of several consonants, and so _&ast;noŋi_ was apparently reanalysed as _&ast;no-ŋi_, giving an intransitive root _&ast;no_, reflected in Ghari. This _&ast;no_ in turn became the root of newly innovated transitives like _&ast;no-ki_ (cf Tolo _noki_) or PPn _&ast;no-qi_.

There is another minor complication in the reflexes of POc _&ast;noŋi_. The Central Papuan languages Aroma, Motu, Gabadi and Roro have forms that could reflect _&ast;noŋi_, _&ast;noki_ or _&ast;noqi_. They are interpreted as reflexes of _&ast;noŋi_ because this is the source of all other WOc forms.

[PEOc &ast;_noqi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-4-390-PEOc-noqi-a)

Compared with the above, POc _&ast;suga_, _&ast;sugai-_ ‘ask s.o. for .s.t.’ is a straightforward reconstruction.

[POc &ast;_suga_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-3-4-390-POc-suga-a)

POc _&ast;taman_ ‘ask’ is something of a mystery, in two respects. First, we cannot provide a more specific gloss than ‘ask’ because only the non-Admiralties reflexes below have extended glosses. Second, the initial consonant of the Admiralties reflexes other than Seimat—members of the Eastern Admiralties subgroup—reflects Proto E Admiralty _&ast;ntaman_. Whilst initial prenasalisation is expected on a noun, it is not expected on a verb ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988):337–341).

### 3.5. Commitment verbs


It is possible that Longgu _alaŋaʔi_, Lau _alaŋai_, Wayan Fijian _ala_ and Bauan Fijian _yala_ reflect a PEOc _&ast;ala(ŋ)_ ‘promise’. Otherwise no reconstructions of commitment verbs have been made. One reason for this is that commitment verbs are the least frequently occurring of the four complement-taking classes of speech act verbs ([§12.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-1#cldf:6-12)). Another is that verbs meaning ‘promise’ are often compounds, as listed in (25).[^14] There is some evidence (Tolo, Tamambo, Lolovoli) that there was a PEOc term for ‘promise’ made up of the verbs ‘say’ and ‘put’ (POc _&ast;taRu(q)_, [vol.5:449](ContributionTable?anchor=p-449#cldf:5-6)).

## 4. Expressive speech act verbs


When speakers use an expressive speech act verb, they categorise the intention or meaning of a speech act. For this reason most expressive speech act verbs are not followed by a complement clause


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Respond co-operatively to another speaker


The single verb in this category refers to interactive conversational structure. A questioning speech act requires an answer and an influencing speech act requires agreement to do what the influencer wants. That is, the first speaker looks for a co-operative response from the addressee, and this response is the meaning of POc _&ast;taRam_, _&ast;taRami-_ ‘answer, agree’.

A minor formal mystery is that final _-m_ of the root seems to have become _&ast;-mʷ-_ in the transitive form in NCV ([Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)).

The Admiralties forms under ‘cf. also’ seem at first sight to be reflexes of _&ast;taRami_. However, they reflect a putative POc †_&ast;ja(Ra)mʷi_, and we are at a loss as to how to explain the difference in the initial consonant from POc _&ast;t-_.

<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. Tell a story


Storytelling was an important activity in perhaps all traditional Oceanic-speaking societies. The PNPn term _&ast;[ka]kai_ ‘traditional story’ is reconstructed in [§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12) above under POc _&ast;kʷa_, _&ast;kʷai-_ ‘say, tell’. In [§6.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-7#cldf:6-12) two speech-act verbs meaning ‘tell a story’ are reconstructed: POc _&ast;takunu_ ‘tell a story, narrate’ and PPn _&ast;tala_ ‘tell stories; tale, story’.


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Call out


In a small community where many of the people one relates to are within hailing distance, calling out is a fairly frequent occurrence. It seems to fall into two distinct speech acts: calling out to greet or welcome someone ([§12.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-3#cldf:6-12).1) and calling out to attract attention ([§12.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-3#cldf:6-12).2).


<a id="p-393"></a>


<a id="s-4-3-1"></a>

#### 4.3.1. Greet


The verb for calling out a greeting was evidently POc _&ast;paila_/_&ast;pela_. The form _&ast;paila_ is reflected only in Iduna, but the unidirectionality of sound change means that it is the older form, and _&ast;pela_ is (only slightly?) more recent.

[POc &ast;_paila_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-3-393-POc-paila-a)

The only other form reconstructable with this meaning is POc _&ast;kʷaro_, for which just three reflexes are known to us.

[POc &ast;_kʷaro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-3-393-POc-karo-a)


<a id="s-4-3-2"></a>

#### 4.3.2. Call to attract attention


Two POc terms and one PEOc term meaning ‘call out to s.o.’ can be reconstructed. The first, _&ast;pato_, _&ast;patoli-_ ‘say or call s.o.’s name; say, speak’ seems to be focussed on the act of calling itself. The second, _&ast;soRo(p)_ ‘call, summon’ also includes the intention to attract someone’s attention or to summon them. The third, _&ast;kai_ has a similar meaning to _&ast;soRo(p)_, but the glosses of its reflexes suggest an added element of forcefulness.

The _&ast;-l-_ of _&ast;patoli-_, the transitive form, is reconstructed on the basis of the stem-final consonants of the Mangap, Kwaio and Arosi transitive reflexes.

[POc &ast;_pato_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-3-393-POc-pato-a)


<a id="p-394"></a>

Putative stem-final _&ast;-p_ of POc _&ast;soRo(p)_, _&ast;soRo(p)i-_ below is reconstructed on the basis of the stem-final consonants of the Arosi and Wayan Fijian transitive reflexes. However, the consonant can be reconstructed with certainty only for PEOc, as the only non-EOc transitive form, Minaveha _hone-i_, lacks a stem-final consonant.

[POc &ast;_soRo(p)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-3-394-POc-sorop-a)

Although the forms listed below look as if they could be reflexes of POc _&ast;kʷa_, _&ast;kʷai-_ ‘say, tell’ ([§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12)), on closer inspection this is implausible, first because the base form of the reconstruction below is clearly _&ast;kai_, whereas the base form of the reconstruction in [§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12) is _&ast;kʷa_, and second because there is a clear difference in meaning between the set in [§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12) and the set below. Also to be noted is an extension of the meaning to the vocalisations of animals in the southernmost languages of the set, Nguna and Xârâcùù.

### 4.4. Talk behind someone’s back


In any human community there are inevitably some speech acts that are perceived as unpleasant. These are the subject of this section, [§12.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-5#cldf:6-12) and [§12.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-6#cldf:6-12).

Blust’s reconstruction of PWMP _&ast;kunu_ ‘it is said, people say…’ (ACD) as an impersonal expression is supported by his western Malayo-Polynesian reflexes. He also cites Arosi _ʔunu_ as a reflex, and this clearly belongs to the SES cognate set below. POc _&ast;kunu_ can be reconstructed, but without Admiralties or WOc reflexes its gloss is uncertain.

[PMP &ast;_kunu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-4-395-PSES-kunu-a)


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. Talk negatively to someone


The verb reconstructed below is reflected only in NNG and MM languages. The gloss ‘speak negatively or scornfully to (s.o.)’ is reconstructed on the basis of the Buang and Nakanai forms. They are far enough apart geographically and genealogically to be independent pieces of evidence. In the Schouten languages Wogeo and Manam, reflexes of _&ast;pile_ have lost their negative element and are verbs of speaking in general. The Kaulong reflex, it seems, cannot be explained without more local knowledge.

<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. Deceive, tell a lie


Working with dictionaries, it becomes obvious that many Oceanic-speaking communities recognised various degrees of lie-telling, rather like English _fib_, _white lie_ and _lie_. Unfortunately, the available data do not allow us to rank the eight verbs of lie-telling reconstructed below, although POc _&ast;balau_ stands out as having a more specific gloss than the others.

[POc &ast;_rupʷas_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-6-396-POc-rupas-a)

The three items that follow have few reflexes, but they are in each case sufficiently distributed genealogically for, respectively, a POc, a PEOc and a PCP reconstruction ro be made.

[PCP &ast;_lasu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-6-396-PCP-lasu-a)


<a id="p-397"></a>

POc _&ast;lami_ seems to have added an element of temptation or enticement to the telling of a lie.

[POc &ast;_lami_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-4-6-397-POc-lami-a)

Finally, POc _&ast;balau_ has non-Pn reflexes that appear simply to mean ‘lie’, but Pn reflexes that roughly mean ‘lie by exaggeration’. Unfortunately, evidence that would narrow down the meaning reflected in non-Pn languages is not known to us.

<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Speech manner verbs


Speech manner verbs are those which refer to the manner in which an utterance is produced, without assigning a particular significance to the utterance,. The reconstructions in this section denote speaking loudly or shouting, whispering, stammering and speaking a foreign language or something that sounds like one.

The evidence for POc _&ast;kabat_ ‘call or speak loudly’ is drawn almost entirely from Micronesian reflexes, but the apparent cognacy of Lou (Adm) kapat ‘speak out’ and Nakanai (MM) aba ‘call, announce (loudly)’ makes this a POc term. However, the Lou and Nakanai terms attest to POc _&ast;kapʷat_ (or possibly _&ast;kabʷat_), while the Micronesian forms reflect _&ast;kapʷata_, with unexplained final _&ast;-a_. Vangunu _kepoto_ ‘say’ is shown under ‘cf. also’ because its gloss doesn’t match those of other cognates. It is a regular reflex of POc _&ast;kapʷat_.

[POc &ast;_kapʷat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-5-None-397-POc-kapat-a)


<a id="p-398"></a>

Only a few reflexes of POc _&ast;ŋulu_ ‘in a whisper’, _&ast;ŋulu-ŋulu_ (v) ‘whisper’ are known to us, but their distribution requires a POc reconstruction.

[POc &ast;_ŋulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-5-None-398-POc-ulu-a)

It is possible that the two terms for ‘stammer’ below are independent innovations. A verb ta ‘speak’ occurs in Bola and Tolai, and it is possible that tata and tatata are onomatopoeic formations based on it.

[PEOc &ast;_&#91;ta&#93;tata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-12-5-None-398-PEOc-tatata-a)

The two reconstructions below are verbs meaning ‘talk in a foreign languages’, but some reflexes of PROc &ast;kato are perhaps metaphorical variations on the meaning. Proto Micronesian appears to have changed the final vowel from _&ast;-o_ to _&ast;-a_.

It is just possible that PPn _&ast;kote_ does reflect PROc _&ast;kato_, but with unexpected changes in its vowels.

## 6. Other uses of report verbs


In a number of Oceanic languages verbs with a report sense ([§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12)) are also used like English ‘think’, in the sense of ‘opine’, as we noted in [vol.5:542](ContributionTable?anchor=p-542#cldf:5-10)–544:

> … OPINE is quite often expressed by a language’s default verb of saying, so that in Baluan (Adm), for example, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the speaker intends the complement of _pʷa_ to be spoken or simply thought (Dineke Schokkin, pers. comm.).

This is also true of Mangap (NNG) _-so_ ‘say, think’. [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007)) gloss the Mangap sentence in (26) as both ‘I say that is not good’ and ‘I think that is not good’.

[6-12-6-None-399-18](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-399-18)

The Äiwoo (TM) verb _-kæ_/_kɒ-_ is also used in both senses ([Næss 2016](Source#cldf:Nss2016):48–49):

[6-12-6-None-399-19](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-399-19)

[6-12-6-None-399-20](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-399-20)

The Äiwoo verb _-kæ_/_kɒ-_ has a further extension of meaning: it is also used in the sense of ‘want’ ([Næss 2016](Source#cldf:Nss2016):49):

[6-12-6-None-399-21](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-399-21)


<a id="p-400"></a>

Verbs of speaking in a number of Oceanic languages are also used in the sense of ‘want’ or ‘intend’, as the following sentence examples show.

[6-12-6-None-400-22](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-400-22)

[6-12-6-None-400-23](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-400-23)

[6-12-6-None-400-24](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-400-24)

The hallmark of this construction in the last three examples is that when the verb of saying is used in this sense, it is followed by an irrealis complement.[^16]

Intuitively it seems likely that the sequence of extensions was ‘say’ > ‘think’ > ‘want’/ ‘intend’, but the evidence is insufficient to test this.

It seems likely that at least POc _&ast;pʷa_, _&ast;pʷai-_ ‘say, tell’ and _&ast;pʷaca(q)_, _&ast;pʷaca(q)i-_ ‘speak, say’ were used in these senses. It might be argued that in the ‘think’ and ‘want’/‘intend’ senses, these are no longer speech act verbs, as nothing is actually uttered. However, the extensions of meaning occur precisely because speakers apprehend thinking and wanting as unuttered speech.

The following list of examples where ‘say’ can also mean ‘think’ or ‘want’/‘intend’ is expanded from that given in [vol.5:544](ContributionTable?anchor=p-544#cldf:5-10). A number of these verbs are listed in the cognate sets in [§12.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-1#cldf:6-12).

[6-12-6-None-400-adm-baluan-pa](cf.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-400-adm-baluan-pa)


<a id="p-401"></a>

It is noted that expressions like ‘I want/hope/wish’ sometimes take the form of a body-part metaphor like those described in [volume 5, ch.9](ContributionTable#cldf:5-9). This metaphor is literally translatable as ‘my insides say’. Examples are:

[6-12-6-None-401-25](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-12-6-None-401-25)

## 7. Conclusion


In the foregoing sections 22 POc speech act verbs have been reconstructed, along with two PWOc, six PEOc, four PPn and one each for PSES, PNCV and PCP. In making this count only a cognate set’s highest-order reconstruction has been counted. Reconstructions at levels older than POc have been ignored.

These numbers are low in comparison with the multiplicity of speech act verbs in the Fijian languages or in English, a fact accounted for by paucity of data[^17] and the presence of numerous compound speech act expressions in some, perhaps many, Oceanic languages ([§12.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-3#cldf:6-12)). Gaps in the data prevent us making a more specific generalisation. In the discussion of compound expressions in [§12.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-3-5#cldf:6-12) we noted that PEOc perhaps had a compound speech act expression for ‘promise’ consisting of the verbs ‘say’ and ‘put’. Further research would probably lead to further findings of this kind.

We have also examined the grammatical behaviour of speech act verbs ([§12.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-1-2#cldf:6-12)), and seen that the same verb used with different grammatical constructions may have distinct senses. Understanding this behaviour and its grammaticalisation allows us to recognise that at least some complementisers are derived from verbs ([§12.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-2#cldf:6-12)).

Reconstructable expressive verbs—verbs, that is, that need no complement as they express propositional meaning themselves—include some of the normal interactions of any human conversation: replying ([§12.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-1#cldf:6-12)), talking behind someone’s back ([§12.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-4#cldf:6-12)), abusing them ([§12.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-5#cldf:6-12)) and lying to them ([§12.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-6#cldf:6-12)). But telling stories ([§12.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-2#cldf:6-12)), calling out a greeting ([§12.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-3#cldf:6-12).1), calling to attract attention ([§12.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-4-3#cldf:6-12).2) and shouting loudly ([§12.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-5#cldf:6-12)) reflect the essentially oral communication of traditional Oceanic societies.


<a id="p-402"></a>

The data in [§12.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-6#cldf:6-12) support the possibility that POc report verbs were in some cases also used in the senses ‘think, opine’ and ‘want, intend’.


## Notes

[^1]: The division of labour among the authors is roughly as follows: BE compiled most of the cognate sets and contributed to the introductory sections; MO did the research underlying [§12.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-12-6#cldf:6-12) and suggested various revisions of the text; and MR wrote most of the text of the chapter.

[^2]:  Very few Oceanic dictionaries meet our criteria. Those that do include [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007); Mangap), [Samson et al.](Source#cldf:Samsonetal2018) ([2018](Source#cldf:Samsonetal2018); Sursurunga) and [Pawley & Sayaba](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022) ([2022](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022); Wayan Fijian).

[^3]:  Leech admits that his categorisation, based on [Searle’s](Source#cldf:Searle1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Searle1976)), has rough edges, but nothing better has appeared, and it serves our comparative purposes well enough.

[^4]:  For simplicity’s sake the examples given in (1a) and (1b) have simple transitive verbs. Some report verbs, e.g. _tell_, _inform_, _advise_, add an object<sub>A</sub> to the constructions above (e.g. _I told John that I was coming_), as do some question verbs (e.g. _We asked the inspector if/whether the school would be closed_). The constructions in (1) are indicated informally and omit various stipulations that are not relevant here.

[^5]: The labels of 1.c and 1.d are borrowed from [Sag & Pollard](Source#cldf:SagandPollard1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:SagandPollard1991)).

[^6]: [Leech](Source#cldf:Leech1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Leech1983):211) notes that the constructions themselves also occur with non-speech-act verbs. They convey speech act meaning only with a speech act verb.

[^7]:  These examples simply support the claim that English ask is unusual in its semantic range. It is almost certainly not the case that the members of these pairs are semantically equivalent across languages.

[^8]: In many Oceanic languages every verb has a prefixed or proclitic subject pronominal. This is also true of the verb in a complement clause whose subject is coreferential with the subject or object of the speech act verb. Teop is different: a subject pronominal is phonologically independent of the verb, allowing its deletion in a complement clause, giving clause reduction. Whether this is true of other Oceanic languages with clause reduction is a matter for research.

[^9]: No attempt is made here to investigate how ‘apparent compounds’ fit into the grammars of the languages in which they occur, nor what their history is. For this, see papers in [Bril & Ozanne-Rivierre](Source#cldf:BrilandFrancoiseOzanneRivierre2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:BrilandFrancoiseOzanneRivierre2004)).

[^10]: More accurately _mōri_ means ‘unmarried female’.

[^11]: In accord with his descriptive framework Early calls these ‘nuclear layer serialisations’.

[^12]: This renders Wolff’s _&ast;kuwas_ in the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) orthography used in these volumes. Blust’s [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) does not list PAn _&ast;kuaS_. He reconstructs PWMP _&ast;kua_ ‘whatchamacallit, filler for word that cannot be recollected’ and _&ast;kua-n_ ‘quotative [complementiser]’. The latter is almost certainly an undergoer voice form ([vol.5:27](ContributionTable?anchor=p-27#cldf:5-1)) of _&ast;kua_. The glosses of some reflexes of both forms suggest that the reconstructions can be glossed ‘say’ and ‘what is said’ respectively. Reid (2011) gives Kambera _wà_ ‘say’, providing a CMP reflex.

[^13]: Supporting SHWNG reflexes are (Rajah Ampat) Kawe, Laganyan _ba_, (CB) Serui-Laut _(a)fa_, Dusner _ve_, Biak _(a)p_, Waropen _-fa_ (< _&ast;mba_) ([Dalrymple & Mofu 2012](Source#cldf:DalrympleandMofu2012); [Kamholz 2014](Source#cldf:Kamholz2014):205; [Mofu 2010](Source#cldf:Mofu2010)).

[^14]: Mangap and Lewo are copied from (14) and (18). Sources not listed in the Appendix are [Fitzsimons 1989](Source#cldf:Fitzsimons1989):147 (Zabana), [Jauncey 2011b](Source#cldf:Jauncey2011b):397 (Tamambo) and [Hyslop 2001](Source#cldf:Hyslop2001):393 (Lolovoli).

[^15]: Anejom _-c_ for †_-l_, as POc _&ast;l_ > _c_ before _&ast;i_, _&ast;e_ or _&ast;o_, but remains _l_ before _&ast;a_ or _&ast;u_.

[^16]: These are not serial verb constructions, as the two verbs of a SVC match in reality status (realis or irrealis).

[^17]: One factor perhaps contributing to paucity of data is that direct quotation is apparently much more common in Oceanic narrative texts than indirect speech. Where an English speaker says _She asked him about …_, an Oceanic speaker seems likely to quote the question as direct speech. This reduces the frequency of speech act verbs. In this respect the Oceanic narrative genre seems different from anything that might be regarded as its English counterpart. But how one might measure or define this difference lies outside the scope of this chapter.

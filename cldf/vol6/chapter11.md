## 1. Introduction


This chapter complements the ways of talking about time discussed in chapter 9 of volume 2. That chapter addressed concepts like ‘day’ and ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow’. This one is concerned with longer periods of time.

Time is an abstract concept, expressed in western terms by countable named entities, days of the week, months of the year, numbered years. In fact it is difficult for westerners to conceive of time in other than named measurable periods with clear boundaries. But traditionally Oceanic speakers seem not to have thought of time in this way. Here we look at how early Oceanic speakers conceived of years, seasons and the lunar cycle, and consider whether they treated the latter as a system.

The chapter is organised as follows: First, in [§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:6-11), we explore the concepts of years and seasons. In [§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:6-11) the interrelationship between lunar months and the solar year is discussed as their interaction is relevant to any form of calendar. Next, in [§11.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4#cldf:6-11), we discuss the checkpoints that recur in Oceanic speakers’ talk about the calendar. In [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11) we review lunar month names in a range of Oceanic languages, illustrating the use of checkpoints and the kinds of conceptual world they denote. Lunar months imply moon phases, and these are examined in [§11.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6#cldf:6-11).

We observed in [vol.2(320](ContributionTable?anchor=p-320#cldf:2-9)) that lunar month names “have complex associations with their users’ culture, both material and non-material” and wrote that they would receive a chapter to themselves in a later volume. We endeavour to keep that promise in [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11) but lunar ‘months’ turn out to be something other than we might have envisioned when volume 2 was compiled.

## 2. Years and seasons


Early Oceanic communities were inevitably aware of the annual cycle evident in movement of the sun and stars, in regular seasonal changes to weather patterns and in the growth and flowering of plants, both cultivated and wild. They knew that certain foodstuffs, particularly the yams on which many communities were dependent, had a regular growing season, with optimal times for planting and harvesting, and they associated yam planting and harvesting with, among other things, the positions of certain stars in the night sky.


<a id="p-298"></a>

But we cannot be sure that early Oceanic speakers had a concept of, or at least a term for, one complete annual cycle as illustrated by the sun and stars. When we look up ‘year’ in dictionaries we find expressions that translate as ‘rainy season’ (Kove) or ‘yam season’ (Sa’a) or ‘yam harvest’ (Kwaio) or ‘time of ripe canarium almonds’ (Bugotu) or even just ‘garden’ (Gedaged). In other words, examples of well-recognised seasonal cyclic events are used to represent the annual cycle.

Another reason for wondering if speakers had a concept of year was that a person’s age in years was apparently irrelevant to their thinking. To have a meaningful count in years, it is necessary to have a shared base line from which to start counting, something for which there is no evidence across Oceanic communities prior to western influence. Numerous ethnographies refer, both directly and indirectly, to the fact that Oceanic speakers seemed to have no interest in counting years of age ([§14.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-2#cldf:6-11).3). Alkire, for example, notes (1970:37) that “an individual does not think of his age in terms of years (a unit of measurement of little traditional importance in Woleai) … but only comparatively, as being younger or older than some other person of reference.”

Below is the cognate set given in [vol.2:308](ContributionTable?anchor=p-308#cldf:2-9)–309 in support of POc _&ast;taqun_, along with two glosses, the first given in vol. 2, the other a revised definition for which we argue below.

[PMP &ast;_taqun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-2-None-298-POc-taqun-a)


<a id="p-299"></a>

Here we have a reconstruction with sufficient evidence to support three concurrent meanings: ‘year’, ‘season’ and ‘yam season cycle’. But some ethnographic comments give us pause. Codrington writes that in Mota, in the Banks Islands of northern Vanuatu:

> There is no native notion of a year as a period of fixed time; the word _tau_ or _niulu_, which corresponds most nearly to the word ‘year’, signifies a season, and so now the space of time between recurring seasons: thus the yam has its _tau_, its seasons of five moons from the planting, when the erythrina is in flower, till the harvest, after the palolo has come and gone;[^1] the breadfruit has its _tau_ during the winter months; the banana and the cocoanut have no _tau_, being at all times in fruit.’ ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):349)

[Fornander](Source#cldf:Fornander1878) ([1878](Source#cldf:Fornander1878):124) records the following for various parts of Polynesia:

> In all the Polynesian dialects the primary and original meaning of _tau_ is ‘a season; a period of time’. In the Tonga group it has the further sense of ‘the produce of a season’ and derivatively, ‘a year’. In the Samoan group, beside the primary sense of ‘season’ it has the definite meaning of ‘a period of six months’, and conventionally that of ‘a year’. In the Society group it simply means ‘a season’. In the Hawaiian group, when not applied to the summer season, it retains the original sense of an indefinite ‘period of time’, ‘a lifetime’, ‘an age’, and is never applied to a year; its duration may be more or less than a year, according to circumstances and the context.’

Their evidence suggests that POc _&ast;taqun_ did not refer to a fixed period of time, but to a period that varied with context. In other words it was a name for any regularly recurring seasonal period. When we find languages using a reflex of _&ast;taqun_ to refer to ‘year’ it seems that, as in the Maori definition, it is being used as just one particular recurrent cycle: its length is irrelevant. A quote from [Jenness & Ballantyne](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920) ([1920](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920):160), writing about the Bwaidoga (PT) speakers of Goodenough Island in the D’Entrecasteaux Archipelago, reflects a similar concept, albeit with a different term. They write that

> a native who wished to date some event that happened some time in the past might say that it occurred three _malamala_ ago, in the _avalata_ (north-west monsoon) season, i.e. between October and March;[^2] or in the yam time, from June to August; or he could be still more precise, and name the actual stage in the growth of the yams, and thereby narrow the period down to a single month.

They tell us that _malamala_ is the name given both to a season ushered in by the sun at its northern zenith and also to the whole period covered by the sun’s annual movement, i.e. a year. Chowning’s (n.d.) dictionary of neighbouring Molima confirms the first definition: ‘period from December to April, time of big sun after planting, yamless period’. The ‘year’ definition is confirmed by Huckett, Lucht and Awadoudo’s (1992) dictionary of Iduna, a dialect of Bwaidoga, where _malamala_ is glossed as ‘year’. However, _malamala_ has a deeper history, as its Kilivila and Muyuw cognate is _milamala_ ‘palolo worm’, the risings of which were and are an important checkpoint in the Oceanic year ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)). At some point in the past, a Bwaidoga speaker who said that something occurred three _malamala_ ago was saying that it occurred three palolo risings ago.


<a id="p-300"></a>

Our conclusion is that POc speakers had a concept of a recurrent seasonal cycle, _&ast;taqun_, which could be applied to cycles of different durations including possibly the annual cycle. The corollary to this is that there was no POc term for the concept of a fixed, measurable block of time that westerners refer to as ‘year’.

It is difficult to determine which terms for a year in Oceanic dictionaries reflect the longstanding usage of a term and which reflect an adjustment to the western fixed-term concept. Where terms for a year other than reflexes of _&ast;taqun_ have been adopted they typically come from horticulture or arboriculture, such that a salient annual event doubles as the term for an annual cycle. Examples in addition to those given on p297 include the following: In Dobu (PT) _yakʷara_, ‘last year’s garden’, has become the term for a year. In Kiriwina (PT) the term for the staple crop, _taytu_ ‘small yam’, also carries the meaning ‘year’. Tolo (SES) _uvi_ means both ‘yam’ and ‘year’. In the southeast Solomons languages spoken in Malaita and Makira there is a cognate set[^3] that refers to the yam harvest but includes ‘year’ among its senses: Lau _falisi_ ‘garden, yam harvest, year’, Kwaio _falisi_ ‘yam harvest, year’, ’Are’are _harisi_ ‘grass, small clover, yam harvest, year’, Arosi _harisi_ ‘year, season, crop’, Sa’a _halisi_ ‘harvest, crop, time of ripening, yam season, year’. The ’Are’are, Arosi and Sa’a dictionaries make the proviso that the denotation ‘year’ is a recent one. Other food crops with regular planting and harvesting seasons also assumed the added sense ‘year’. Thus Marovo (MM, New Georgia) _buruburu_ ‘_Canarium_ spp.’ also means ‘year’, the interval between two ripenings of canarium almonds ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005):107). Similarly Maringe _finoɣa_ ‘canarium harvest’, and To’aba’ita _ŋali_ ‘canarium nut tree and fruit’ all also have the sense ‘year’.[^4] In Mangaia in Eastern Polynesia, “in the premissionary times, the age [of a child] was counted by counting the number of breadfruit (_kuru_) harvests” ([Shibata 1999](Source#cldf:Shibata1999):110).

There are, however, indications that a common application of _&ast;taqun_ was to the complete cycle of yam growing. From the cognate set we learn that the year was equated with the yam season cycle in Buang, Tongan and Maori. [Kirch & Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):267) comment that “in Western Polynesian languages, reflexes of PPN _&ast;taqu_ (e.g., [E Futunan] _taʔu_) refer not just to ‘season’, but more specifically to ‘yam season’.” Although yams, particularly Discorea alata, and taro, _Colocasia esculenta_, were both important staples for POc speakers ([vol.3:256](ContributionTable?anchor=p-256#cldf:3-9)), it was Discorea alata whose time of planting was critical. Taro is not seasonal, growing throughout the year. When people wanted to refer to a time equivalent to ‘last year’ or ‘next year’, they tended to do it by referring to their previous yam garden or their future yam garden.

In the light of this discussion the revised definition of POc _&ast;taqun_ given above reads ‘recurrent seasonal cycle, especially yam season cycle’.


<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. Named seasons



<a id="p-301"></a>

While POc _&ast;taqun_ was the generic term for any seasonal cycle, specific seasons were separately named. The POc homeland in the Bismarck Archipelago, and indeed much of western Oceania, experience two seasons, strongly marked by wind and weather: the dry, when the southeast trades blow with reasonable consistency, and the wet or monsoon, when the less reliable northwesterlies blow. The names of the winds, POc _&ast;raki_ ‘southeast trades’ and POc _&ast;apaRat_ ‘northwest wind’[^5], almost certainly also denoted the dry and wet seasons respectively. The wet and dry seasons do not have sharp boundaries, however: the focus is on the events that define them.

Almost all Oceanic communities for which we have relevant information divide the year into these two main seasons, sometimes accompanied by a short season between them, but the names do not always reflect the POc terms. Thus Wogeo had the _kama_ ‘trade wind season’ and the _yavara_, ‘monsoon season’ (< POc _&ast;apaRat_) ([§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).1). Maenge had _vinte_ ‘the wet’ (May–September) and _kaepâ_ ‘the dry’ (November–March) ([§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).2). Barok has _awat_ (< POc _&ast;apaRat_) “identified with the traditional cycle of six lunations, [while] two _awat_ are encompassed by the sun’s annual circuit of the ecliptic” ([Wagner 1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986):40). The two _awat_ are _awat ni nien_ ‘season of plenty’ and _awat nere loŋ_ ‘season of hunger’. Barok _awat_ has thus taken over the semantics of POc _&ast;taqun_. Tangga, spoken on small islands east of New Ireland, contributes no month names but offers _bāt ae us_, ‘the rainy season’ (November–March; _us_ ‘rain’) and _pisae_ ‘the sun’ or ‘dry season’ (May–September) ([Bell 1946](Source#cldf:Bell1946):143).

Some of these names may have originally been allusions to crop-based seasons. [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008):177) writes that the To’aba’ita year was traditionally divided into two halves: six months of canarium almonds (April–September) and six months of strong winds (October–March). [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):397) writes that in Sa’a “practically there are two divisions of the year: _marāu_ or _āu_, the time associated with the canarium almonds [_ŋali_], and _oku_, the time associated with the palolo” (cf [§11.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-4#cldf:6-11)). Mota had _maɣoto_ ‘Miscanthus grass’ (‘wet season’), _rara_ ‘_Erythrina_’ (‘dry season’), and _ud_ ‘palolo season’. [Kirch & Green’s](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):260ff) detailed examination of time reckoning and the ritual cycle in Polynesia is summarised in 11.5.7.

[Grimble](Source#cldf:Grimble1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Grimble1931)) describes a Kiribati year of two seasons, marked by observation of _te auti_ ‘Pleiades’ from early December to early June,[^6] and _rimʷimāta_ ‘Antares’ from early June to early December. The year is considered to begin with the appearance of the Pleiades about 15 degrees above the eastern horizon just after sunset, in about the first week of December. It seems likely that Kiribati time reckoning has been influenced by Polynesian: two seasons are maintained, but are now star-based.

A number of names like those above also serve as labels for what ethnographers sometimes describe as ‘months’, but we argue in [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11) that these ‘months’ do not add up to anything like a calendar in the modern Western sense.


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Lunar months and solar years


There is a tension between the solar year with its solstices and the lunar cycle. The dry and wet seasons and the times for planting and harvesting crops are all governed by the solar year and the stars, while shorter periods of the year are linked to named lunar ‘months’. How was this difference reconciled in traditional Oceanic societies?


<a id="p-302"></a>

A lunar cycle consists of 29.53 days. Twelve lunar months total a year of 354 days, eleven days short of a solar year. In most Oceanic societies for which we have descriptions of lunar months, the year was divided into twelve lunations, although in some cases thirteen are recorded, totalling 384 days. Either way, if a strict program of activities were carried out according to the lunar calendar it would have gradually become out-of-sync with the annual seasonal cycle. It follows that a system of reckoning time by referring to a systematic list of lunar months has little practical value unless it includes some mechanism for intercalation, i.e. for inserting days to align the lunar year with the solar year.

The need for intercalation carries with it an assumption that people are aware of the existence of a solar year containing a specific number of lunar months. But this assumption is not borne out by the few detailed accounts we have of attitudes to time, at least in WOc. While most ethnographers evidently assume a concept of a year as a fixed period of time, for speakers time is more flexible, with allowance for adjustment so that lunar months and known seasonal events do not get out of step. Malinowski reported (1927:209) that “in the Trobriands the moons are used rarely and only under special circumstances for counting time; the whole system of naming and arranging moons has no special place in their time-reckoning.” Rather they would become aware that at times the moons and the start of a seasonal cycle were out of step, or as the Trobrianders put it, “the moons become silly” (1927:213).

[Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):35) distinguishes between lunar month names (_kʷel_) and moons in Muyuw (PT).

> Muyuw can count moons. They do not count _kwel_ (although a new _kwel_ begins with a new moon)… People might be able to tell me at what _kwel_ something should happen but not how many _kwel_ between now and then. They are keen observers of the moon and its phases, but they do not systematise their observations.

[Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):4) considered the question of intercalation, noting that while the east had a twelve month calendar, Central Muyuw had a thirteenth month. He writes “This disparity might once have meant something quite significant – perhaps a way of adjusting solar/lunar discrepancies … Repeated attempts to explore this contrast, however, revealed nothing during either of my research periods.”

[Chowning & Goodenough](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2016) ([2016](Source#cldf:ChowningandGoodenough2016)) writing of the Nakanai of New Britain who identify eight months and [Seeman](Source#cldf:Seeman1862) ([1862](Source#cldf:Seeman1862):297) who had considered the problem inherent in his eleven-month Fijian calendar, both describe similar solutions. In both locations a period of from two to four months is treated flexibly so that the rest of the year is marked out by more precise markers of time such as the palolo rising ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)). In Nakanai this period is about four months, roughly from June to September. In Fiji the period is aligned with the time of clearing and preparing gardens around June and July.

[Wagner](Source#cldf:Wagner1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986)) writes that the Barok of New Ireland use correlation between the moon, the sun and the Pleiades in regulating their gardening activities, with the movements of the relatively constant sun and Pleiades acting to correct the seemingly variable nature of the lunar cycle. He names six lunations, suggesting that one, _tege gowo_, ‘the one that is left’, may serve to fill the variable space until the appropriate new moon appears ([§11.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-3#cldf:6-11).2).

In Polynesia, where the calendar became more systematised than in early Oceanic, there were procedures for intercalation. According to [Collocott](Source#cldf:Collocott1922) ([1922](Source#cldf:Collocott1922):168) in Tonga

> With [the month of] Tanumanga the year normally ends. If, however, observation of the yam and other plants and of fishes at the next new moon fails to discover the appearances proper to the month with which the year begins, Lihamua, another month is intercalated.


<a id="p-303"></a>

Buck (1932:230) records a different system in Rakahanga in the Cook Islands whereby the usual year of twelve lunar months would be replaced at intervals by a thirteen-month year. “The intercalation of a thirteenth month was decided by the simple rule that a new year could not start until the first new moon after the morning rising of the Pleiades”. The strict application of the rule would automatically lead to the intercalation of a 13th month in some cycles.

In Hawaii according to [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941):97) a calendar consisted of twelve months of 30 days plus five days interspersed at various times set aside for religious rites. We wonder if this is in fact a post-contact adjustment. We have found no evidence elsewhere in Oceania that the year is seen as a unit of fixed length of 365 days, but rather a collection of recurring cycles.

The assortment of ways in which communities, or perhaps ethnographers, have tried to fit lunar months into a solar year leads one to think that not only was this difficulty unanswered in POc times, but rather that the problem simply did not exist for its speakers. If the annual cycle was seen as not a fixed period of time ([§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:6-11)), and if lunar months could not be combined to form an assembly ([§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11)), the question of reconciling the two systems becomes meaningless. Rather, the topic may have become a matter for debate following introduction of the western conceptual system of time.


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. Checkpoints


The term “checkpoint” is used here of natural, arboricultural and horticultural phenomena that occur cyclically and allow Oceanic speakers to locate themselves in the cycle of the seasons and prompt them to perform particular activities. Some checkpoints are fairly precise; for example, the rising and setting of the Plaeiades ([§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11).1), the annual rising of the palolo sea worm ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)). Other checkpoints are fuzzy: for example, the readiness of the canarium almonds for harvesting ([§11.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-5#cldf:6-11)), or the beginning and ending of the wet season ([§11.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-7#cldf:6-11)).

As becomes obvious below, a checkpoint can also sometimes become entrenched as the name for a period of time in which the named phenomenon occurs. When we use the term ‘month’ in an Oceanic context, it is these periods of time that we are referring to: not a period of time defined by its boundaries but a period of time that centres on a cyclically occurring event (see further [§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11)). Exceptions to this generalisation are found in Micronesia ([§11.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-7#cldf:6-11)) and Polynesia ([§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11)).

Most of our data on seasonal time are in the form of lists of so-called lunar month names collected from more than 30 languages from Western Oceanic, the SE Solomons, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Fiji and Polynesia. They consist of, usually, 12 or 13 names for or references to the kinds of phenomenon mentioned above that serve to mark roughly sequential points or approximate periods of time through an annual cycle. The lists show that the same kinds of markers are recognised in widely scattered parts of Oceania, notwithstanding its geographic range. They include the apparent annual movement of the sun ([§11.4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-1#cldf:6-11)) and stars ([§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11)), the palolo rising ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)), plant cycles ([§11.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-4#cldf:6-11)–6), weather patterns ([§11.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-7#cldf:6-11)), and land crab migrations ([§11.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-8#cldf:6-11)). In spite of this, the lists are a very varied lot. It is apparent that except in Micronesia and Polynesia they offer very little in the way of shared terms that could be taken as a basis for reconstructing a calendar of POc lunar months. In this chapter we explore the ways in which communities used these checkpoints in order to see if any system can be recognised.

<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Solstices


Solstices occur twice each year, in June and December. In the Bismarck Archipelago and elsewhere in the southern tropics, the June solstice is the time when the sun reaches its lowest zenith, the December solstice its highest. Their occurrence as checkpoints in Oceanic communities is mentioned infrequently in the literature, but all early Oceanic speaking communities must have been aware of them.

[Panoff](Source#cldf:Panoff1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):155) writes of speakers of Maenge (NNG; a dialect of Mengen, SE New Britain):

> Both extreme points from which the sun rises at solstices are perfectly known and are identified with conspicuous landmarks on the horizon (mountain, reef, islet etc.), which differ from village to village according to the surrounding topography. They are called _kae taraŋana_ ‘resting places of the sun’, since they correspond to a ten days’ full stop in the shift.

[Jenness & Ballantyne](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920) ([1920](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920):160) write that the Bwaidoga (PT)

> have noticed [the sun’s] annual movement and related it to their gardening operations. _Igoboda_, the time when the sun is farthest south, is the period when gardening commences; when it reaches half-way back to the north again it is harvest-time; and at its northern zenith it ushers in the _malamala_ season.

[Wagner](Source#cldf:Wagner1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986):39) writes that the Barok (MM, New Ireland)

> seem always to have noted the seasonal variation in the points-of-rising of the sun and moon … The northern solstice occurs when the sun rises over Lihir and the full moon rises over Namarodu … and the southern solstice when the sun rises over Namarodu and the full moon rises over Lihir.

Although similar terms for the solstices have been noted in various parts of Polynesia (see [vol.2:153](ContributionTable?anchor=p-153#cldf:2-5)), no reconstructions are possible.


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. The stars


Stars appear to move across the sky in a circle whose centre is the north or south celestial pole. Stars closer to the pole describe a smaller circle and never disappear from the night sky. Others describe a larger circle that takes them below the nighttime horizon: they traverse the sky invisibly during sunlight. The first pre-dawn rising of a star after a period of invisibility and the last post-dusk setting before invisibility had calendrical significance for many premodern peoples.[^7] But the event recognised in pre-modern communities is the first brief __apparent__ pre-dawn rising of the star, which occurs when the star is high enough above the horizon to be seen, perhaps two weeks later than its astronomical counterpart. Apparent risings are later than their astronomical counterparts and apparent settings earlier. On the basis of dates given in ethnographies, we assume that the apparent first or last rising/setting occurs when the star is 15 degrees above the horizon, but the actual date depends on the topography of the community’s environment and on weather.


<a id="p-305"></a>

These events affect all stars that rise and set. They appear to have been of especial importance in Nuclear Polynesian ([§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11)), where certain month names are associated with the rising or setting of a given star. PNPn _&ast;tolu_ and PEPn _&ast;takulua_ evidently referred respectively to the pre-dawn rising of the middle star in Orion’s Belt and of Sirius, PNPn _&ast;tākelo_ to the post-dusk rising of Betelgeuse. The most important sidereal checkpoints for traditional Oceanic speakers were the risings and settings of the Pleiades ([§11.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2-1#cldf:6-11)), but it can scarcely be the case that the Pleiades were the only night sky events of which they took notice.

With the single exception of the Pleiades, knowledge of stars and their movements seems today scarcely to exist in western Oceanic communities.[^8] The only record there of stars being used as calendar reference points comes from two closely related communities, Kilivila speakers of the Trobriand Islands and Muyuw speakers from nearby Woodlark Island ([§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).1.1). A far more detailed awareness of stars has been retained in Micronesia and Polynesia, no doubt due to their importance in navigation ([Lewis 1972](Source#cldf:Lewis1972)) ([vol.2, ch.6](ContributionTable#cldf:2-6)). Here one finds month names that are simultaneously star names. These terms, however, are never cognate with those in Kilivila and Muyuw.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. The Pleiades


The Pleiades are a small bright patch of stars with an annual orbit such that at times they disappear from the night sky. Their significance as a checkpoint may have formed part of the corporate memory that the ancestors of POc speakers brought with them from a former homeland. Their presence with similar functions in languages across the Indo-Malaysian archipelago ([Forth 1983](Source#cldf:Forth1983); [Ammarell 1988](Source#cldf:Ammarell1988)) suggests that this was true at least as far back as PCEMP.[^9] The Pleiades have been recognised as significant calendrical markers throughout the Oceanic world, although the timing of their appearance, and thus the particular event(s) they mark, have changed by about five weeks in the approximately 3000 years since POc was spoken[^10].

The dates of the Pleiades’ apparent risings and settings in the year of writing (2016) and in 1200 BC (approximately when POc was spoken) at Kimbe, New Britain, are given in [Table 11.1](#table-11.1). Kimbe is chosen as it is within the assumed region occupied by POc speakers. In Apia, Samoa, the dates are just a day later.[^11]


<a id="p-306"></a>

Areas in which the Pleiades are known to provide checkpoints include the north New Guinea coast (Wogeo, [Table 11.10](#table-11.10) in [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).1), around the Huon Peninsula of New Guinea (see below), in Mangap-Mbula ([Table 11.12](#table-11.12) in [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).3), in Barok ([Table 11.18](#table-11.18) in [§11.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-3#cldf:6-11).2), in Micronesia ([Table 11.22](#table-11.22) in [§11.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-7#cldf:6-11)) and Polynesia ([Table 11.23](#table-11.23) in [§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11).1).

In Western Oceanic communities the position of the Pleiades in the night sky provides a series of indicators to stages in the yam cycle. In a number of languages of the north coast of New Guinea, the Pleiades (Gedaged _bal̥ as_, Bing _barahas_, Takia _baras_, Wogeo _baras_, Manam _barasi_) are associated with young women and fertility rituals marking the start of the agricultural cycle. It is worth quoting [Mager’s](Source#cldf:Mager1952) ([1952](Source#cldf:Mager1952):17–18) Gedaged dictionary entry for _bazas_ (= _bal̥ as_) in full. It refers to the Pleiades’ first pre-dawn rising.

> The Pleiades constellation thought of as young unmarried women. When they reappeared on June 13th or 14th the fertility rites were observed. When first seen the tauz triton shell was blown and a big rumpus made by beating and shouting. All the young people were awakened and driven into the sea to bathe; this was to cause them to be healthy, tall and beautiful. … When the Pleiades reappeared the people knew that it was time to prepare the fields for planting yams.

[Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b) ([1938b](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b)) describes the situation in Wogeo ([§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).1), an island off the north New Guinea coast, where certain rites known as _baras losalosa_ ‘washing the Pleiades’ (or ‘washing the pubescent girls’), are performed.

> These are associated with the changing position of the Pleiades, a constellation known as _Baras_, the term for a girl passing through her first menstruation. … The purpose of the rite is to secure protection from sickness during the coming year and to ensure a good nut harvest (1938:138).

[Wedgwood](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435) ([1934-35](Source#cldf:Wedgwood193435):397) describes an apparently identical rite in nearby Manam, _barasi di-ruʔu_ ‘they wash the Pleiades’, marking the beginning of the agricultural year. It takes place in the months of April, May or June according to the village which is performing it. Wedgwood comments

> I was not able to find out how the people of Manam adjust the lunar year to the solar year, but I was given the names of thirteen ‘moons’, and was told that the people knew which ‘moon’ was which by the position of the Pleiades just after sundown in relation to the mountain top ([Wedgwood 1934](Source#cldf:Wedgwood1934):397).

Wedgwood’s ‘mountain top’ refers to Manam Island itself, a near-perfect volcanic cone.

There is a tantalising entry in Chowning’s (n.d.) dictionary of Molima (PT): _veʔovaiya-liwoliwo_ ‘to greet the reappearance of the Pleiades’ (presumably its first pre-dawn rising), but apart from _ovaiya meyavinena_ ‘Pleiades’ there is no elaboration. The word _ovaiya_ has no known meaning outside this context, but _meyavine-na_ means ‘female’. Is this an echo of the association between the Pleiades and pubescent girls attested in Gedaged, Wogeo and Manam? Intriguing is the fact that _ovaiya meyavinena_ ‘Pleiades’ contrasts with _ovaiya meʔolotona_ ‘Orion’s Belt’, where _meʔolotona_ means ‘male’.


<a id="p-307"></a>

In Yabem (NNG) [Streicher](Source#cldf:Streicher1982) ([1982](Source#cldf:Streicher1982):80) writes about the period when the Pleiades are prominent in the night sky:

> the Pleiades [_dam_, _damɔ_] are the main constellation seen by the Jabêm [Yabem] during the dry season (October to March) and governing their activities in their gardens; i.e. the felling of trees to clear the ground for new gardens; the burning and planting of fields is done according to the position of the Pleiades.

Along with other terms for the Pleiades from around the Huon Peninsula, Yabem _dam_, _damɔ_ appears to reflect PAn _&ast;damaR_. However, PAn _&ast;damaR_ is also more obviously the ancestor of POc _&ast;ramaR_ ‘coconut leaf used as a torch when fishing’ ([vol.3:382](ContributionTable?anchor=p-382#cldf:3-12)). The Huon Peninsula terms would reflect a putative POc _&ast;dramaR_, of which the initial nasal-grade consonant would probably reflect an unknown morphological modification. Its POc reconstruction remains uncertain.

[PAn &ast;_damaR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-4-2-307-POc-dramar-a)

Yabem _dam-saŋiŋ_ is a compound which [Streicher](Source#cldf:Streicher1982) ([1982](Source#cldf:Streicher1982)) explains as follows:

> People ask each other, “Have the Pleiades disappeared from the western sky or not?” Disappearance of the Pleiades marks the end of the dry and the beginning of the wet season. Hence _dam_ ‘Pleiades’ and _saŋiŋ_ ‘enquiry’.

The Yabem term thus refers to the last post-dusk setting of the Pleiades in late April or early May, and the Numbami term evidently marked the same seasonal transition. The Sio and Mangap terms, however, seem to refer to their first post-dusk rising in early December, and an ethnographic note in [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b) ([2007b](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b)) says that this marked the canarium trees beginning to form buds ([Table 11.12](#table-11.12)).

Although the Pleiades carry less weight for the Maenge of New Britain (NNG), their appearance and disappearance are noted. [Panoff](Source#cldf:Panoff1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):156) writes that

> The movement of the Pleiades, which are called _kumana puni me_, literally ‘a dense cluster of young taros’ has failed to suggest to the Maenge the notion of a yearly cycle, although their disappearance [their last post-dusk setting–MO & MR] is interpreted as a signal to plant the last taros before the heaviest rains of the wet season.

In Bwaidoga (PT) in the northern D’Entrecasteaux, [Jenness & Ballantyne](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920) ([1920](Source#cldf:JennessBallantyne1920):161) write that the Pleiades


<a id="p-308"></a>

> is the best known of all the constellations…. The natives often date their yam harvest from the time when the Pleiades appear in the east in the early evening till the time when they have moved over to the west.

In Dobu (PT), [Fortune](Source#cldf:Fortune1963) ([1963](Source#cldf:Fortune1963):127) writes that

> gathering times are regulated by the position of the Pleiades in the sky … When he rises at about 15º angle with the ocean the bush is cleared; at about 30º the land is planted. He climbs from the north-eastern to the south-western sky, sets in the south-west, and is unseen for over a month. Then, when he rises in the north-east, harvest time is come.

[Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):39) notes with regard to Muyuw speakers (PT; [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).1.2) that yams should be planted when the Pleiades “is thirty or so degrees above the western horizon at dusk, in February” en route to their last post-dusk setting.

For the Barok people of New Ireland (MM), “the timing of the gardens is regulated by three celestial indicators: the moon, the sun and the Pleiades” ([Wagner 1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986):37). A discussion of the Barok calendar is provided in [§11.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-3#cldf:6-11).2.

In his discussion of local knowledge of the heavenly bodies in north Vanuatu, [Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):348) writes that

> The Banks’ Islanders and Northern New Hebrides people content themselves with distinguishing the Pleiades, by which the approach of yam harvest is marked.

The Pleiades play a significant calendrical role throughout Micronesia where it takes its place in a sequence of twelve stars or constellations that serve as monthly timekeepers ([§11.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-7#cldf:6-11)).

The calendrical uses of the Pleiades described above refer to single events. In some EOc languages, however, this has developed into a marking of the two seasons into which the year is divided ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:6-11)).[^12]

[Kirch & Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):260ff) have made a detailed examination of the reckoning of time and the ritual cycle in Polynesia, and we have drawn on their account for much of the following. They quote from early descriptions – Tahitian King Pomare in 1818 (quoted by [Henry 1928](Source#cldf:Henry1928)), and [Gill](Source#cldf:Gill1876) ([1876](Source#cldf:Gill1876)) on Mangaia, among others – showing that the risings and settings of the Pleiades were widely observed in many Polynesian societies, “where they were used to mark the change in seasons and/or to mark the commencement of the year” ([Kirch & Green 2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):262). In this they concur with [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941):76) who wrote that

> undoubtedly the Polynesians carried the Pleiades year with them into the Pacific from the ancient homeland of Asia. With but few exceptions they continued to date the annual cycle from the rising of these stars until modern times.

[Gill](Source#cldf:Gill1876) ([1876](Source#cldf:Gill1876):317) writes that in Mangaia

> The arrival of the new year was indicated by the appearance of Matariki, or Pleiades, on the eastern horizon just after sunset, i.e. about the middle of December. Hence the idolatrous worship paid to this beautiful cluster of stars in many of the South Sea Islands. … In many islands extravagant joy is still manifested at the rising of this constellation out of the ocean.


<a id="p-309"></a>

Kirch and Green note ([Kirch & Green 2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):261–262) that the pre-dawn rising of the Pleiades is observed as a significant event in East Futuna, Tikopia, Rakahanga, Pukapuka, Mangareva, Tuamotu and New Zealand, while the post-dusk rising is significant in Tokelau, Tuvalu, Tahiti and Mangaia. Both are significant in Hawaii. The pre-dawn rising counts as the beginning of the year in Tokelau and Rakahanga, while in other locations across Polynesia it is the post-dusk rising that counts. Kirch and Green infer from these distributions that both dates were important for the early Polynesians, the May and October risings – or the new moons which followed them – marking the beginnings of the two seasons, PPn _&ast;taqu_, into which most Polynesian communities divided their annual cycle. Strictly, it was probably not the rise of the Pleiades themselves that counted as the beginning of the new season, but the appearance after their rise of the first sliver of a new moon.

As Kirch and Green note, the ancestral Polynesian calendar was inseparably linked to the horticultural year, and especially the seasonal yam crop, whose scheduling depended on climatic seasonality within the Polynesian homeland ([Kirch & Green 2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):265). The pre-dawn rising in May signalled the onset of the dry season in the Tonga-Samoa region, the Polynesian homeland, while the post-dusk rising in October announced the onset of the wet.

A POc term for the Pleiades, repeated here from [vol.2:171](ContributionTable?anchor=p-171#cldf:2-6), can be tentatively reconstructed – “tentatively” because the Nakanai, Roviana and Gela reflexes are phonologically irregular. However, no reflexes have been found in calendrical terms.

[PMP &ast;_buluq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-4-2-309-POc-buluq-a)

Apart from the small groups of New Guinea north coast and Huon Peninsula languages mentioned above, terms for the Pleiades in Western Oceanic show no evidence of cognacy. They are reconstructable as month names only in Micronesia (PChk _&ast;mʷakariker_ ‘about July; the Pleiades’; [§11.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-7#cldf:6-11)) and Polynesia (PNPn _&ast;mataliki_ ‘month name, June’, from PPn _&ast;mataliki_ ‘Pleiades’; ([§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11)).

### 4.3. Palolo risings


The palolo worm, _Eunice viridis_ (also _Leodis viridis_ or Palolo viridis) is a segmented sea worm that lives in crevices in a coral reef. Its annual spawning occurs in a widely distributed number of places, but always at a time associated with the lunar cycle. In Eastern Oceanic communities this is typically six to nine days after the full moon in October and November ([Burrows 1955](Source#cldf:Burrows1955):141) while in Wogeo [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b) ([1938b](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b):132) identifies it with the week preceding the full moon. There is a minor rising, followed one lunation later by a major rising. Occasionally, if the first rising occurs very late in the cycle there may be no second rising. The lunar cycle moves back about eleven days every year, so that the critical dates actually occur, as far as there are records, at variable dates between mid-October and mid-December ([Burrows 1955](Source#cldf:Burrows1955); [Caspers 1984](Source#cldf:Caspers1984)).


<a id="p-310"></a>

Each year, before spawning, the palolo generates a tail, often several times larger than its body, containing eggs and sperm. When the lunar timing is right the tails are released and undulate to the surface where they form a writhing mass, the segments bursting and releasing a milky, gelatinous soup of eggs and sperm. A rising lasts about four hours before dissolving away. Its occurrence is predictable, and in many Oceanic locations the palolo’s breeding frenzy is interrupted by people who scoop up the tails before they burst and cook them as a culinary delight.

The palolo’s appearance, although recorded in various places in Western Oceanic, carries less calendrical weight there than in Eastern Oceanic. Damon reports that on Muyuw (Woodlark Island) although the palolo (_milamala_) appears around the full moon of, usually, October, it is neither eaten nor used for any calendrical purposes (1982:229). Similarly, although Maenge on the south coast of New Britain

> seem to be able to foretell with good accuracy the time of appearance of Palolo viridis, they have never thought of making a time marker of this striking phenomenon ([Panoff 1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):158–59).

However, [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b) ([1938b](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b):132) writes for Wogeo on the NNG coast that

> the seven or eight days preceding the night of the full moon in late October or early November are deliberately avoided when fixing dates for festivals. On this one night of the year (or occasionally on the night following) that curious marine annelid, the palolo worm [_manuam_], rises to the surface of the sea for spawning. It is regarded–with reason–as a great delicacy, but the haul is so uncertain that a taboo is imposed beforehand on all save urgent tasks in an attempt to ensure the co-operation of supernatural forces in securing favourable conditions.

[Mondragón](Source#cldf:Mondragon2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Mondragon2004):294) writes that in Loh in the Torres Islands of northern Vanuatu the palolo rising is not simply a source of food but has elicited long-standing ritual.

> Once a year at dawn (on November 15th by the Gregorian calendar), if the sky is clear, the people of Loh gather in Peliauluwo to observe the rising sun as it emerges just to the south of the outline of Ureparapara. This, they claim, is a signal that the Palolo shall emerge from the ocean later that day. Although there has never been a tradition of horizon-based astronomical observation in the Torres, Loh islanders have long employed the peculiar solar alignment as a key indicator of the emergence of the Palolo and the approach of the summer solstice.

Although there are obvious errors in linking the rising of the palolo with a fixed solar event rather than a more mobile lunar one, as Mondragón notes, the association is presumably a remnant of some earlier calendrical ritual which has now been mistakenly fixed into the western calendar.

Because the palolo worm is tied directly to the lunar cycle, it plays a substantial role in the naming of lunar months. Many languages with month names that include a palolo term have a pair of such names associated with the small and big risings and denoting successive months around October and November. A number (Sa’a, ’Are’are, Loh, Mota, Mwotlap) use the term for palolo to refer to a season that may extend for several more months, while in Kwaio its regular appearance marks the span of a year. The palolo occurs in month names in a few Western Oceanic languages (Kairiru _munuan_,[^13] Wogeo _manuan_, Yabem _igeyaŋ_, Bing _yagyahag_, Kilivila/Muyuw _milamala_), but the only reconstructed terms are PEOc _&ast;(o,u)du_ ‘palolo worm’ and PCP _&ast;balolo_ ‘palolo worm, season name’ ([vol.4:212](ContributionTable?anchor=p-212#cldf:4-4)). Below is a list of SES and NCV palolo month names. From these it is clear that PEOc would have had a term meaning literally ‘big palolo’ referring to the month of the major rising, with a range of possible terms for ‘big’.[^14]


<a id="p-311"></a>

[6-11-4-3-311-ses-gela-odu](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-4-3-311-ses-gela-odu)

Semantically the Fijian languages agree with the languages above in reflecting PEOc ‘big palolo’. They also agree with Loh, Mota and Mwotlap in having month names meaning ‘small palolo’, suggesting that the latter occurred in PROc.

[6-11-4-3-311-fij-bauan-balololailai](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-4-3-311-fij-bauan-balololailai)


<a id="p-312"></a>

Like Fijian, Polynesian languages reflect PCP _&ast;balolo_ ‘palolo worm’, but differ in replacing ‘small’ and ‘big’ with reflexes of PPn _&ast;muqa_ ‘first’ and &ast;muli ‘last’. Palolo risings have not been reported in Polynesia outside Tonga and Samoa, and month names have become divorced from their original reference and are now simply recurring names in a list. Even in Samoan the terms refer inexplicably to two non-palolo months.[^15]

[6-11-4-3-312-pn-efutunan-palolomua](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-4-3-312-pn-efutunan-palolomua)

What the listings above do not show is that the palolo month names were integrated into a system that included other aspects of the annual cycle, aspects which are sometimes mentioned in the notes attached to lists of names. Thus in Wogeo _manuan_ also marks the beginning of _yavara_ ‘north-west monsoon season’ (< POc _&ast;apaRat_, [vol.2:129](ContributionTable?anchor=p-129#cldf:2-5)–130) while in Sa’a _oku peine_ marks the _awalosi_ ([vol.2:130](ContributionTable?anchor=p-130#cldf:2-5)), again the northwest monsoon that brings the rainy season ([Hogbin 1938b](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b):137; [Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):397). Kilivila _milamala_ marks the beginning of the new year, preceded by the yam harvest and followed by the burning, clearing, and planting of next year’s gardens ([Damon 1982](Source#cldf:Damon1982):231). Similarly in Loh, yams and other crops are planted around _nʉt_ ‘palolo’ and poles are erected for the climbing vines around _nʉt lavü_ ‘big palolo’. The series of _nʉt_ month names continues with _nʉt melüɣehe_ ‘green palolo’ and _nʉt memüdarü_ ‘red palolo’. According to [Durrad](Source#cldf:Durrad1939) ([1939](Source#cldf:Durrad1939)) and Alexandre François (fieldnotes) ‘green palolo’ is when the yam vines are in full green leaf and ‘red palolo’ is when they begin to turn red. [Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891)) records ‘small palolo’ as the season of maturity and ‘big palolo’ as the time for digging up the tubers. Thus his yam calendar runs a month behind those for Kilivila and Loh.

Although no POc term for palolo can be reconstructed ([vol.4:212](ContributionTable?anchor=p-212#cldf:4-4)), there is enough evidence to suggest that POc speakers may have had at least a calendrical checkpoint named for the palolo.


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Yam or taro cultivation


The one marker of the time of year that would have been consistently recognised by all members of a community was the stage of development of the staple crop, particularly the yam, _Dioscorea_ spp., on which many communities depended for their survival ([vol.3:258](ContributionTable?anchor=p-258#cldf:3-9)–261). Yams are seasonal, with planning essential for prior garden preparation and sowing. Once established, the developing vines are usually given a stake or frame for support. Leaves change colour and die off, indicating the appropriate time for harvesting. The yam crop effectively serves as a kind of time line along which various points may be identified to mark a particular occasion or event. Thus, almost the whole life of a community, the times for greatest gardening activity, for rituals, for feasting, for trading, would be dependent on the timing of the staple crop. So it is not surprising that month names based on the various stages of yam cultivation, are common in Oceanic languages such as Kwaio ([Table 11.3](#table-11.3)), Mota ([Table 11.4](#table-11.4)), Fijian ([Table 11.5](#table-11.5)) and Tongan ([Table 11.2](#table-11.2)), although they do not extend beyond Tonga, which lies at the eastern extreme of cultures practising yam cultivation. Tongan itself, however, has one of the most articulated (or perhaps best described, by [Collocott 1922](Source#cldf:Collocott1922)) sets of agriculturally based month names.


<a id="p-313"></a>

At the opposite extreme, there are almost no Western Oceanic month names that directly denote stages of yam cultivation. However, certain Sinaugoro names refer indirectly to yam growing ([Table 11.16](#table-11.16) in [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).2). The term _ɣʷa-koli_ ‘April approx.’ means ‘month of no food’ (_ɣue_ ‘moon, month’, _koli_ ‘finished’), referring to the time of hunger, while _ɣʷa-ɣaniɣani_ ‘May approx.’ means ‘month of eating’ (_ɣaniɣani_ ‘eating, food’) heralding harvest after _ɣʷa-koli_.

| 11-12 | _tanu-maŋa_       | ‘throwing soil on branch, fork’ | A growing yam is likely to project slightly above the ground. Frequently a small yam grows down from the same stem thus making a branch or fork on the head of the root. In this month if the head of a yam appears forked (_maŋa_), the gardener banks it over with soil (_tanu_). |

Other month name sets that refer to agriculture are from the SE Solomons and Vanuatu, and refer to stages of yam cultivation. [Table 11.3](#table-11.3) lists Kwaio (SES) month names that refer to such stages.

Loh (NCV) month names are set out in [Table 11.20](#table-11.20) in [§11.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-5#cldf:6-11). Here the colour terms in _n’ʉt mələɣɛhə_ ‘green palolo (January)’ and _n’ʉt meməʈarə_ ‘red palolo (February)’ refer to the leaves of the yam, not to the palolo.

[Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891)) lists a set of alternative month names in Mota ([Table 11.4](#table-11.4)) which clearly refer to gardening activities, and these are echoed in the limited data available from central and southern Vanuatu. Thus Atchin (Malakula) _hil-hilɛn_ ‘name of a feast’, literally ‘digging up’ and _ruwan_ ‘clearing (forest)’. Two other Atchin month names echo the Sinaugoro pair above: _boŋ hoal wele_ ‘days of little food’ and _boŋ hoal lɛp_ ‘days of much food’. [Crowley](Source#cldf:Crowley1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Crowley1998):154) notes that in Sye (SV) some month names refer to the yam cycle. They consist of _mov_ and a verb. Thus _mov-ɣorovoh_ (August) where _ɣorovoh_ means ‘s/he cleared a garden site’ is ‘month of clearing a garden site’. Similarly _mov-ɣerevei_ (September) ‘month of trimming’, _mov-ɣowi_ (November) ‘month of planting’.

<a id="p-315"></a>

There are terms in Wayan Fijian ([Table 11.5](#table-11.5)) that look suspiciously like month names as they begin with _vula_ ‘moon, month’, but it is clear from the period lengths they denote (in the leftmost column) that they here mean ‘season, time of year’, as [Pawley & Sayaba](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022) ([2022](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022)) note. The same is probably true of the similar expressions in Bauan Fijian in [Capell](Source#cldf:Capell1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Capell1941)).

### 4.5. _Canarium_ arboriculture


_Canarium_ arboriculture was practised in New Guinea probably for millennia before the arrival of Oceanic speakers. There are numerous tree species of the genus _Canarium_. Those grown by Oceanic speakers are discussed and terms for them reconstructed in vol.3. POc _&ast;[ka]ŋaRi_ referred to C. Indicum and probably was also used as the generic term ([vol.3:312](ContributionTable?anchor=p-312#cldf:3-11)–317). The edible fruit is often called the canarium nut or canarium almond.[^16]

_Canarium_ almonds continue to be highly valued in Near Oceania and Vanuatu because they are good eaten raw or smoked, and pounded almonds are an essential ingredient in much appreciated oily puddings. As a result, their annual harvest in July and August has given rise to various ceremonies and rituals ([vol.3:314](ContributionTable?anchor=p-314#cldf:3-11)), and these have come to mark certain months of the year in various communities in Near Oceania.[^17]

The most extreme instance of canarium-based month names in the data is in Mangap (NNG) from [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen 2007b](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007b), listed in [Table 11.12](#table-11.12) in [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).3. The ethnographic definitions shown in the “Accompanying notes” column of [Table 11.12](#table-11.12) all refer to canarium (Tok Pisin _galip_) trees.

The Roviana month names in 11.4.5 are from [Waterhouse’s](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949) ([1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949)) dictionary. Only _muzara_ ‘approx. October’ is assigned to a western month. The month _haele_ can be assigned to July–August as its gloss (‘climb’) and the accomanying note indicate that it is the time of the canarium harvest. The month _lomu kubata_ must also be somewhere around harvest time.

Waterhouse’s definition of _okete_ ‘_Canarium_’ reads

> _okete_, a tree [Canarium sp.]. The ripening, gathering and storing of the nuts were important features in Roviana life, and several of the months take their names from various phases of the _okete_ cult.

Not much appears to be known about the Roviana canarium cult, but the month names in 11.4.5 indicate that canarium was sacrificed at _hope_, ‘the general name for sacred places, especially where skulls are placed’ ([Waterhouse 1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949)). There is plentiful archaeological evidence of canarium in Roviana shrine excavations ([Aswani & Sheppard 2003](Source#cldf:AswaniandSheppard2003)). A perhaps similar cult is recorded on neighbouring Choiseul by [McClatchey et al.](Source#cldf:McClatcheyetal2006a) ([2006a](Source#cldf:McClatcheyetal2006a)). About canarium, they write:


<a id="p-316"></a>

> Its usage so permeated peoples’ ceremonial and dietary lives that some ancient and special relationship is connotated particularly through usage as a sacrificial offering and as a principal symbol of land tenure and authority … The uses and interactions with _Canarium_ by the Babatana and Ririo are extensive and permeate most aspects of traditional life. It is difficult to imagine these cultures in the absence of _Canarium_.

Various month names referring to canarium almonds in other Oceanic languages are listed in [Table 11.7](#table-11.7). These mostly denote the time when the canarium almonds are first ready for harvesting, and the geographic distribution of these names further attests to the cultural importance of canarium.

No reconstructions of month names involving the canarium almond can be made, even at quite local levels, but the data and discussion in this subsection indicate that in cultures of Near Oceania the canarium almond is more important than any other food stuffs except the yam ([§11.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-4#cldf:6-11)), and that it has (or had, traditionally) a significance that goes beyond nutrition. In the western Solomons there was a canarium cult. Whether or not the naming of months for events in the canarium cycle reflects an earlier canarium cult, is unknown. However, the cultural significance of the canarium is widely enough spread in Near Oceania to suggest that if there was a term in POc-speaking communities labelling a lunar month around June, July and August it was likely to be one that referred to the ripening or harvesting of canarium almonds.

### 4.6. Wild plants


The Maenge calendar ([Table 11.11](#table-11.11), [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).2) represents the most extreme instance of months being named for wild plants, but such names are fairly common across Oceania. One of the most widespread is the flowering of the coral tree or erythrina (POc _&ast;rarap_ ‘_Erythrina_ spp.’, POc _&ast;baR[baR]_ ‘_Erythrina variegata_’; [vol.3:158](ContributionTable?anchor=p-158#cldf:3-5)–161), with distinctive bright orange-red spiral flowers at the end of each branch. It occurs in month names in Maenge (NNG), Sinaugoro (PT; [Table 11.16](#table-11.16)) and Mota (NCV; [Table 11.20](#table-11.20)). The tree is often a salient feature in and around Melanesian coastal villages, and its flowering is often taken as an indicator that it is time to plant yams. Other references to the erythrina are less specific (or less well understood). Two NCV languages of Malakula refer to the erythrina. They are Avava, which has the name _ivlemial_ for November, glossed ‘red, _Erythrina variegata_’ by Crowley (2005), and Atchin, for which [Capell & Layard](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980)) give the month names _rere tsar_ ‘the leaves of the erythrina are falling’ (_tsar_ ‘erythrina’) and _ni-rere_ ‘[the erythrina is] red’.

Also featuring in month names are two tall grass species. In Western Oceanic this is usually _Saccharum edule_ (PWOc _&ast;tabuqaR_, [vol.3:301](ContributionTable?anchor=p-301#cldf:3-10)), known in Papua New Guinea as _pitpit_, a tall grass related to sugarcane (_Saccharum officinarum_). It is cultivated for the unopened inflorescence at the tip of the cane, which is harvested as a seasonal vegetable that is either roasted in its leafy sheath or cooked in coconut cream with other vegetables. The other grass is _Miscanthus floridulus_ (POc _&ast;pi(y)uŋ_, [vol.3:253](ContributionTable?anchor=p-253#cldf:3-8)), a reed-like grass which grows on dry hillsides, to about 2 metres tall.

[Table 11.8](#table-11.8) shows that the month names that refer to the two grasses are more or less in complementary distribution, with _Saccharum edule_ in NNG and _Miscanthus floridulus_ in SES, Vanuatu and Fiji. The event that is marked across the languages in [Table 11.8](#table-11.8) is the flowering of the grass, usually in April or May (Bariai, Yabem, Arosi and Wayan Fijian). It is at least plausible to suggest that this month was also labelled in this way in POc, and that terms for _Saccharum edule_ were replaced by terms for _Miscanthus floridulus_ as Oceanic speakers moved eastward.

### 4.7. Weather patterns


The weather cycle of Pacific communities is dominated by the contrast between the wet and the dry seasons. In the dry season, typically from May to October, the southeast trades (POc _&ast;raki_) blow, in the wet the northwesterlies (POc _&ast;apaRat_), from December to March, and the sea is rough ([vol.2:131](ContributionTable?anchor=p-131#cldf:2-5)–135). Between the seasons are the doldrums.

Month names in some languages make fairly simple reference to the seasons. Thus in Kove (NNG) May is called _hai kaŋkaŋa_, presumably the start of _hai_ (< POc _&ast;raki_), August simply _hai_, and the period from September to November _sua-hai_ ([Chowning 2009](Source#cldf:Chowning2009)). Sinaugoro and Motu (PT) each have a month _lailai_, but in Sinaugoro it denotes June, in Motu March. Sinaugoro also has the term _lai-toɣa_ ‘quiet _lai_’ for the June–July period.


<a id="p-319"></a>

’Are’are (SES) has several month names that refer to the dry, calm season _ōku_: _ōku rate_ ‘Miscanthus dry season, September’, _ōku māʔa_ ‘very dry season, October’, _ōku paina_ ‘big dry season, December’ (Geertz 1970).

Fewer languages have month names reflecting POc _&ast;apaRat_. Those that do are on the south coast of Papua: _Lala avala_ ‘thirteenth month’ ([Clunn & Kolia 1977](Source#cldf:ClunnandKolia1977)), Sinaugoro _avala-kavata_ and _raba-avala_, both labels for December and presumably meaning ‘start of avara’.

Some languages refer directly to rain, e.g. Tongan (Pn) _vai-mua_ ‘early water, February-March’ and _vai-mui_ ‘late rain, March-April’. Others refer to the rainy weather a little more obliquely, for example, Arosi (SES) _hura-doa_ ‘blind month (because windy and rainy), April’ (_hura_ ‘month’, _doa_ ‘blind’); _waru-ahe_ ‘all streams flooded, May’ (_waru_ ‘stream’; _ahe_ ‘flooded’); _waro ŋaŋara_ ‘violent winds, August’ (_waro_ ‘month’, _ŋaŋara_ ‘rough (of weather)’.

|  02 | _pɛŋgɔʔ-àwà-àndaŋ_ | _pɛŋgɔʔ_ ‘bird sp.’, _àwà_ ‘voice’, _àndaŋ_ ‘hot’ | There is no rain and the cry of the _pɛŋgɔʔ_ bird can be heard during the dry season.                                                                                                                                      |
|  04 | _niplema_          | _nip_ ‘coconut palm’, _lema_ ‘arm, hand’          | The NW monsoon turning to the north blows so strongly that it often shakes the fronds from the palms, much to the despair of the women cooking their meals in front of their houses under the palms of the village square. |
|  05 | _dabuʔ-benoŋ_      | _dabuʔ_ ‘wild sugarcane’, _benoŋ_ ‘calm’          | The time between the dry and the rainy seasons: it is getting cooler; wild sugarcane is ripening; the NW monsoon is abating. The resulting calm was ascribed to the wild sugarcane hulls being thrown into the sea.        |
|  08 | _buani_            | _bu-ŋa-dani_ ‘water its-thicket’                  | The height of the rainy season.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The Sa’a (SES) term for a month around August is _ro hutuhuto_ ‘the two foam’, obviously a reference to rough seas, but the allusion of _ro_ ‘two’ in this context is not known.

One of two languages of communities that undertook long-distance voyaging refer to the odd month with a reference to this. Thus Motu _veadi hiri-hiri_ ‘July’ refers to the _hiri_, the annual trading voyage westward to the Elema communities of the Papuan Gulf, powered by the southeast tradewind. Arosi _ʔariha_ ‘January’ is a nominalisation of _ʔari_ ‘come, go’ and denotes the month ‘when voyages are made’ at the beginning of the northwesterlies season.

Months in Yabem ([Table 11.9](#table-11.9)) show poetic allusions to phenomena associated with the seasons. The numbers in the leftmost column are approximations to the lunar months denoted. The use of metonymic allusion is not restricted to Yabem. It is found in Mangap (NNG) ([Table 12](#table-12)) and the Torres and Banks Islands languages (NCV) ([Table 11.20](#table-11.20)). It was probably widespread, and perhaps many of the month names we cannot gloss are due to the fact speakers have forgotten their meanings or that researchers have not collected them.

### 4.8. Land crab migration


Apart from the palolo, the only animal mentioned in month names across a range of languages is the land crab. Pawley ([vol.4:173](ContributionTable?anchor=p-173#cldf:4-4)) writes:

> The large land crabs, Cardisoma spp., are an important food source in many Oceanic communities and there are often several terms relating to their growth stage and spawning behaviour. For example, [Foale](Source#cldf:Foale1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Foale1998)) reports that in west Gela (central Solomons) females of the abundant land crab _Cardisoma hirtipes_ [Discoplax hirtipes] migrate to the beach at certain phases in the lunar cycle in the wet season, from October to December, releasing zoea larvae from their egg mass (_lami_). … Three weeks before doing this they migrate to the sea to immerse themselves, an event known as the _sapa_ _toga_ (thousands go seawards). This is the preferred time to take them because they are fatter. In Fiji, Wayans refer to the mass migration of _Cardisoma hirtipes_ as _vui_.

Pawley notes elsewhere (2022) that spawning time of land crabs (_tubā_) in Waya ‘happens at high tide on two or three evenings in December, January and February’. Hence Wayan Fijian labels the season from December to February _vula ni vūsē_ (_vūsē_ ‘have or carry eggs or spawn’).

[Panoff](Source#cldf:Panoff1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):157) notes that in Maenge (NNG), the first month of the wet season (end of April to end of May) is called in some villages _goga_, the name given to ‘land crabs [which] leave the bush at night and gather on the beach where they are extensively caught by torch-light’.

Roviana (MM) has four month names, roughly October to February, that allude to the _ɣarumu_ ‘land crab’: _ɣarumu kara_ ‘month of the sea crabs’; _ɣarumu leana_ (_lea-na_ ‘good’) ‘[month] when crabs move to beach [to spawn – MR]’; _porana hite_ (_porana_ ‘poor condition’, _hite_ ‘small’) ‘[month] when crabs are going off in condition, but some are still good; _porana lavata_ (_lavata_ ‘big’) ‘[month when] crabs are no good for food’ ([Waterhouse 1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949))

[Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1955) ([1955](Source#cldf:Fox1955)) defines Gela (SES) _kakau_ (k.o. land crab) as ‘the name of the month of December when crabs come down to the sea to spawn’ while the following month, _tivu popolo_, lit. ‘look for [crabs] in covering’ refers to the time ‘when crabs return from the sea and hide in bushes’.

We have not been able to ascertain why the Maenge month name is attributed to May whilst the remainder centre on December.

## 5. Lunar ‘months’


Lunar months were a useful way of planning for forthcoming festivals or intended trading voyages, or counting off the period of time during which a taboo applied to individuals following a birth or death. Ross quotes an elderly Takia (NNG) speaker describing the timing of a planned event ([vol.2:288](ContributionTable?anchor=p-288#cldf:2-8)):

> All right, and so they waited – in the old times they didn’t know about years. They always kept time by the moon. Thus, when they wanted to set a time – when they wanted to set a time, they mentioned the month. But they also didn’t know the names of the months. The moon waned and waxed, that’s all. They would say the months in this way: they would count the months with their hands, they would count them with their fingers. And then they would say, the month of the little finger will come and will die, the next finger will die, and the next and in the fourth months the man and woman will get married. They said this – well – with regard to their saying that they would marry in four months …


<a id="p-321"></a>

Ross saw in this a striking similarity with Whorf’s description of the Hopi conception of time. While westerners see time as if it is a physical entity, made up of measurable, countable units (minutes, hours, days of the week, months of the year), the Hopi do not make this extension. Ten days cannot be imaginatively experienced by the Hopi as if they were ten men. “[They] experience only one day, today; the other nine (or even all ten) are something conjured up from memory or imagination” (1956:139).

As Whorf describes it (1956:148):

> The count [of days] is by ordinals. This is not the pattern of counting a number of different men or things, even though they appear successively, for, even then, they could gather into an assemblage. It is the pattern of counting successive reappearances of the same man or thing, incapable of forming an assemblage.

Like the Hopi, the elderly Takia speaker was counting successive visits of the same moon. Successive passings of cycles could be counted but they could not be aggregated into a countable unit forming a solid block of time. So although it is perfectly acceptable for Oceanic speakers to name different parts of a day (as when the sun is low in the sky) or a month (as when the moon appears as a slim sliver) or a year (as when the yams are sprouting), they did not add separate parts together to form a whole, or see a period of time as a whole that could be neatly subdivided. This conceptualisation applied to all astronomical cycles, whether daily, lunar or annual.

In spite of the elderly Takia speaker’s claim that “they didn’t know the names of the months. The moon waned and waxed, that’s all”, we have gathered lists of apparent lunar month names from more than thirty languages from Western Oceanic, the SE Solomons, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Fiji and Polynesia. These lists consist of, usually, 12 or 13 names for or references to natural features that mark roughly sequential points or periods of time in an annual cycle and reflect the complex conceptual system of astronomical, meteorological, ecological and horticultural checkpoints that made up the annual cycle in traditional Oceanic communities.

The lists are varied. While some listed names are direct references to or descriptions of events (see e.g. Sa’a, [Table 11.19](#table-11.19)), others are largely untranslatable (e.g. Kilivila, [Table 11.13](#table-11.13); Nakanai, [Table 11.17](#table-11.17)) . Some are strictly local references (e.g. Motu, [Table 11.15](#table-11.15)). Still others refer to events through metaphors or allusions to shared narratives (e.g. Mangap-Mbula, [Table 11.12](#table-11.12); Yabem, [Table 11.9](#table-11.9)). Some languages, like Sinaugoro ([Table 11.16](#table-11.16) in [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).2) and Mota ([Table 11.4](#table-11.4) in [§11.4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-4#cldf:6-11), [Table 11.20](#table-11.20) in [§11.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-5#cldf:6-11)) have many more month names than can fit in a year, and it seems that some or all months have alternative names depending on the checkpoints the speaker is focussed on. Indeed, the considerable variation in month names across Oceanic languages and even among closely related languages (e.g. Sinaugoro/Motu/Lala in [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).2; SE Solomonic in [§11.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-4#cldf:6-11); northern Vanuatu in [§11.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-5#cldf:6-11)) suggests that alternative names have long been the norm.

It is significant that named natural features have a central focus but no precise beginnings and endings, so it is impossible to say when one period ends and another begins. There may be periods of overlap or gaps. This means that even if individual names for times of year were fixed, they could not be aggregated into a solar year. No doubt this explains the response of local speakers that they could not provide memorised lists when requested (in the Trobriands, [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).1.1, in Fiji, [§11.5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-6#cldf:6-11), in Tahiti, [§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11).1). Where neat sets of names exist, these are assumed to result from attempts to fit them into a western time frame


<a id="p-322"></a>

It is easy to read these lists of names as loosely comparable to our calendar months and assume because of their number that the names total a year. But this represents the intrusion of a western concept of time. Oceanic ways of talking about time may be compromised both by speakers’ own efforts to interweave the old system with the western one and by descriptions from ethnographers who have interpreted what they saw in terms of western concepts. The number of named lunar months in a list evidently had little or no place in Oceanic speakers’ conceptions of time. The fact that they are often organised into lists of 12 or 13 is a reflection of a western need to associate activities with western calendar months while also offering local speakers a link to a full moon or a lunar cycle if required. Theoretically, the number of names local speakers could use to identify points of time in a solar year is limited only by local knowledge.

In this light it is unsurprising that a set of POc month names cannot be reconstructed, even though it is reasonably clear from [§11.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4#cldf:6-11) which checkpoints were of importance to early Oceanic speakers. There is evidence, however, that in some places, related communities share similar month names, permitting low-level reconstructions. Examples include Loh, Mota and Mwotlap in the Banks Islands of northern Vanuatu, the Chuukic languages of Micronesia, and Polynesia. It needs to be stressed that the results cannot be regarded as a fixed system. Names cannot be combined to form a solar year. Lists will always include a degree of flexibility to ensure that descriptive names match natural features, and allow alternative names to be substituted as desired.

The following collections of month names are included with some discussion in an attempt to identify any systematic approaches.

#### 5.1.1. Wogeo


The Wogeo language is spoken on two of the Schouten Islands, Wogeo and Koil, located off the north coast of PNG. [Table 11.10](#table-11.10) shows Wogeo month names, pieced together from [Hogbin](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b) ([1938b](Source#cldf:Hogbin1938b):138–140). However, it is clear from Hogbin’s comments that the periods thus named may overlap.

The ‘washing the Pleiades’ ceremony, mentioned in [§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11).1, was performed separately by each of four groups of villages. It is performed by the most northerly group in Bariat village in February “during the month when the Pleiades hang over this part of the island at sunset”, by a second group a month later “when the stars have moved round and the Pleiades are at sunset over Dap [village]”. A third group follows in April when the Pleiades are at Bagiau village, and a fourth group with their own month, at a time not noted by Hogbin. The months of, roughly, February, March and April are simply named the moons of Bariat, Dap and Bagiau. The moon of Bariat is also called kasawara (no gloss given). Where he does give the local names, Hogbin glosses some and comments on others. We have added one gloss, as _rakum_ evidently reflects POc _&ast;rakum(u)_ ‘land crab’ ([vol.4:173](ContributionTable?anchor=p-173#cldf:4-4)–174).

It is noteworthy that this is not primarily a horticultural calendar, as the staple crops, taro and bananas, are grown all year round, and so do not provide checkpoints. Instead, the calendar is based on various events in the natural environment. The months that refer to the Pleiades ([§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11).1), to the harvesting of canarium almonds ([§11.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-5#cldf:6-11)) and wasek nuts and to the southeast trade winds ([§11.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-7#cldf:6-11)) are anchored in the solar, not the lunar, year. Lunar-related events are the spawnings of (probably) the land crab ([§11.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-8#cldf:6-11)) and the palolo worm ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)).


<a id="s-5-1-2"></a>

#### 5.1.2. Maenge


Maenge (a dialect of Mengen, NNG) is located on the southeast coast of New Britain. [Panoff’s](Source#cldf:Panoff1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969)) listing of the months is shown in [Table 11.11](#table-11.11).[^18] The first gloss numbers the western months, but each Maenge month begins a few days earlier. This is the only calendar in our data in which almost every month name reflects the flowering of a wild plant (cf [§11.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-6#cldf:6-11)).

Panoff writes:

> despite the continuous character of the process and the obvious impossibility of recognising clear demarkations between the stages, flowering always remains the final criterion and accounts for some calendar variations from village to village. Moreover, there are unavoidable discrepancies between time reckoned in lunar and in botanical terms whenever flowering happens to be late. ([Panoff 1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):156)

<a id="p-324"></a>

This unit of time follows the phases of the moon very erratically. A _vega matana_ ‘tree category’ ~ ‘month’ may last for as few as 15 days or for as long as five weeks. The Maenge turn their attention to the phases of the moon only to secure a correlation with the tree behaviour. Nevertheless the system is said to work satisfactorily with a margin of uncertainty of less than one month. Perhaps it is precisely the flexibility of the system which has allowed the Maenge not to add a thirteenth month to their calendar, as the observation of the shifting sunrise on the horizon through the year should have urged them to do if their monthly unit had been exclusively lunar ([Panoff 1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):156).


<a id="p-325"></a>

The two seasons, _vinte_ ‘the wet’ and _kaepa_ ‘the dry’ ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:6-11)), each have six lunar months, and are separated by _ulasi_, the one month that has a fish name.

The Maenge are able to foretell palolo risings ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)) and also are aware of the appearance and disappearance of the Pleiades ([§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11).1), but Panoff does not recognise either of these events as a calendrical marker (1969:156, 158).


<a id="s-5-1-3"></a>

#### 5.1.3. Mangap-Mbula


The Bugenhagens’ listing of lunar month names in Mangap-Mbula (Vitiaz Straits:NNG) (2007b:420; [Table 11.12](#table-11.12)) focusses almost solely on the annual cycle of the canarium almond crop ([§11.4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-5#cldf:6-11)), although their accompanying notes are necessary to make that interpretation. For example, _manᵐbule mamāza_ ‘the bird’s anus is dried up’ makes little sense without the accompanying note. ‘Galip’ is the Tok Pisin term for the canarium tree and almond. The ‘Word glosses’ represent our best attempt to gloss the component parts of the month names.

The one interpretable month name that refers less directly to canarium almonds is _ⁿdām-bula_ ‘December’, where the first element reflects _ⁿdāma_ ‘Pleiades’ (in the Marile dialect of Mangap this month name is simply _ⁿdāma_), but the Bugenhagens note that this marks budding of the canarium (and thus the beginning of the cycle).

#### 5.2.1. Kilivila and Muyuw


The calendars of closely related Kilivila and Muyuw provide a rare example of an apparently fixed list of names, to some extent divorced from the seasonal events reflected. Kilivila is the language of the Trobriand Islands. The Trobriand calendar has been the subject of considerable ethnographic debate ([Malinowski 1927](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927), [1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935); [Austen 1939](Source#cldf:Austen1939); [Leach 1950](Source#cldf:Leach1950)). There are two main areas of confusion. One centres on the number of months. The other is the difficulty of correlating these months with specific times of year in a place where four different calendars operate, and identifying the recognised standard by which the lunar months are kept in step with the solar year. The various descriptions of Trobriand lunar months by Malinowski and Austen throw up several unresolved issues, not only between the two authors, but also between Malinowski’s earlier and later papers. Leach’s paper is an attempt to resolve some of the differences.


<a id="p-326"></a>


##### 5.2.1.1. The Trobriands


The Trobriands have a unique system, whereby four regions, Kiriwina (the major dialect of Kilivila) (in the north), Kuboma (centre), Kitava (east) and Vakuta (south), each run a distinct calendar with similar names and similar sequencing, but each starting their year with the _milamala_ moon at a different time: Kitava roughly in June, Kuboma in July, Kiriwina in August and Vakuta in September. The moon called _milamala_ is always the first ([Malinowski 1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935):463). The name _milamala_ is also the name of the palolo worm ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)), which appears on the fringing reef of the Vakuta district during the moon of _milamala_ ‘in September or even October’ (1935:54), presumably giving the moon its name. But the time of year to which it refers varies from one district to another. In other words, its sequence in a recognised list has taken precedence over its original association with a natural event.

Malinowski argues (1927:210) that the fact that each district starts its year at a different time is a reflection of different gardening systems. In places where taro is the staple food, gardens start early and are harvested early. In the main agricultural districts where small yams form the main crop, harvest occurs at least two months later than in the earliest yam districts.


<a id="p-327"></a>

The thirteen names, as given in [Malinowski 1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935) are: _milamala_, _yakosi_, _yavatakulu_, _toliyavata_, _yavatam_, _gelivilavi_, _bulumaduku_, _kuluwotu_, _utokakana_, (_ilaybisila_), (_yakoki_), (_kaluwalasi_), _kuluwasasa_. However, [Malinowski](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927)) and [Austen](Source#cldf:Austen1939) ([1939](Source#cldf:Austen1939)) are agreed that only ten names are significant. The three names whose existence is questioned (bracketed above) are those where informants are least certain, or are names recognised in one or two districts but not all. Two–_yakoki_ and _kaluwalasi_—are listed by Malinowski in 1935 but not 1927. In 1927 he wrote (1927:215) that although

> several moons seem to have different names in different districts, … it is significant that ten moons are identical everywhere and easily obtained, while the remaining odd moons, for which sometimes one to three names are obtained, always fall outside the scheme division of two groups of five.

Austen suggests that _kuluwasasa_ is a corruption of _kʷeluvāsasa_, translated as ‘passageway between the [two] garden periods’ (1939:240). He writes that “the garden periods following _ilaybisila_ are vague, and the moons really have no definite names and it is often a time of confused ideas” (1939:244).

[Malinowski](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927):211) writes that _milamala_ is the moon of festivities after the harvest, and that the sequence _kuluwasasa_, when harvesting is done, _milamala_ and _yakosi_ “are universally known to the natives and they are used by everybody”. Other month names figure less in people’s minds.

[Leach](Source#cldf:Leach1950) ([1950](Source#cldf:Leach1950)) offers an ingenious solution to the question of how this accords with a solar year. He suggests that the _milamala_ period is the key, being a flexible period when taken as a whole across all four districts.

> The _milamala_ period of the whole group covers four months, this plus the other nine month names is sufficient to cover a full lunar year of 12-13 months. Thus in an ordinary 12-month year Kitava celebrates _milamala_ nine months later than Vakuta, which is the ‘standard’, Kuboma one month after Kitava, Kiriwina one month after Kuboma, Vakuta one month after Kiriwina, which completes the annual cycle. The whole territory can thus complete a 12-month cycle without any one area bothering to count more than 10 months. So long as each group knows the relative position of its own calendar to that of its neighbour, the system is complete. … Vakuta _milamala_, as checked by the appearance of the palolo worm, is the beginning of a 12 or 13 month cycle which ends with the three months Kutava _milamala_, Kuboma _milamala_, Kiriwina _milalmala_ (1950:254–255).

[Austen](Source#cldf:Austen1939) ([1939](Source#cldf:Austen1939)), however, sidesteps completely the difficulties of reconciling the palolo rising with the timing of the _milamala_ month. Although his fieldwork in the Trobriands followed closely on the heels of Malinowski, he takes a position against Malinowski in arguing that the Trobrianders used a systematic series of solar observations in keeping the lunar months in step with the solar year. Austen believed that relations between month names, _kʷeluva_, and stars were more important than those between the month names and the moon. He writes that

> there are quite a number of star groups (native constellations) connected with gardening, the most important being … _Uluwa_/_Uruwa_ ‘Pleiades’ and _Kibi_ ‘three stars of Aquila, the central one being Altair’.

In addition Austen lists _sinata_ ‘part of Scorpio’, _lakum_ (‘land crab’) ‘part of Cancer and Hydra incl. Praesepe’, _dubukavivila_ ‘native constellation incl. Hamel’, _kauwoma_ ‘native constellation incl. Aldebaran’, _kiyadiga_ ‘Orion’s Belt’ and _munukaiwau_ ‘Sirius’ (1939:240). And he adds later, “For the correction of the annual lunar cycle, the star group _kibi_ is used” (1939:243). He notes that the community depended on inhabitants of Wawela, a village in the central Trobriands who were the accepted experts in knowledge of the stars, and who were consulted each year as to the timing of forthcoming rituals (1939:239).


<a id="p-328"></a>

Malinowski had written in 1927

> that at certain seasons certain configurations of stars appear in the sky in the evenings. They have names for a number of constellations, for the Pleiades, for a part of Orion, the Southern Cross, and many others; and they know in which season these stars are visible, _but they do not use them as a means of measuring time_’ ([Malinowski 1927](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927):203).[^19] (our italics)

In 1935 [Malinowski](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935) ([1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935):50–51)correlated moons, winds, and gardening and other activities with western months, but his chart contains no mention of stars. Austen’s evidence is discussed further together with Damon’s evidence for Muyuw.


##### 5.2.1.2. Muyuw and the Trobriands


[Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1982) ([1982](Source#cldf:Damon1982), [1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990)) describes the lunar calendar in Muyuw, spoken on Woodlark Island east of the Trobriands, and contrasts its system with that of the Trobriands, with which Muyuw is linked through the Kula Ring trading network. The calendars share similar names and month sequences, but differ in their starting positions and thus their relationship to the western calendar.

[Table 11.13](#table-11.13) contains 13 names of Kiriwina months ([Malinowski 1935](Source#cldf:Malinowski1935):51) and 13 names of Muyuw months ([Damon 1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):290) aligned to highlight similarity of names (they are not aligned with reference to western month names). Nine of the thirteen show cognacy, evidence of a recent shared past. The names listed third, fourth and fifth contain a reflex of POc _&ast;apaRat_ ‘north-west wind’, the wind that holds sway from December to April. Apart from these three and _milamala_ the names are, as far as we can tell, largely untranslatable and therefore without meaning-based association with particular seasonal events. Those pairs that are not cognates are marked with #, and occur close together in the sequence.

<a id="p-329"></a>

Although the two lists imply a shared system, Muyuw lacks a _milamala_ moon. Oddly enough, the palolo worm appears in some Muyuw lagoons at the full moon of, usually, October, and it is called _milamala_. But it is neither eaten nor used for any calendrical purpose ([Damon 1982](Source#cldf:Damon1982):229).

However, there is, or was, another system of regulating time in Muyuw, one shared with the Trobriands, namely that provided by the stars. [Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):29) provides a list of thirteen star groups and roughly aligns them with lunar months and other seasonal events or activities, although he warns: “Although stars are conceived to rise in a sequential order just as _kwel_ [lunar months] follow one another, Muyuw do not associate particular stars with specific _kwel_.” (1990:38).[^20]

Several star names ([Table 11.14](#table-11.14)) are cognate with Austen’s list for the Trobriands, although there are minor variations in their identity. Austen’s _kibi_ refers to Aquila while Damon’s _kib_ is Delphinus, an adjoining constellation. Strangely, although both list the Pleiades, their names for the star cluster are not cognate. In the Trobriands it is _ulawa_ and in Muyuw _gumeaw_.

[Damon](Source#cldf:Damon1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):38–40) implies that Muyuw rely on the stars rather than lunar months to arrange their yearly activities. He describes Muyuw knowledge of celestial bodies as impressive. “It is yam harvest time, people note, when the long axis of the Southern Cross stands vertical in the dark of a young night, mid-July or so”. And although other crops – taro, bananas, sweet potatoes – may be and are planted throughout the year: yams should be planted when _gumeaw_ ‘is thirty or so degrees above the western horizon at dusk, in February.”

#### 5.2.2. Motu, Sinaugoro and Lala


Motu, Sinaugoro and Lala are considered together as they are clustered in the middle of the segment of New Guinea’s south coast occupied by the Central Papuan group of Oceanic languages.

Lister-Turner & Clark’s (1954) Motu dictionary includes twelve month names, given in [Table 11.15](#table-11.15) with glosses drawn partly from Andrew Taylor’s (pers. comm.) notes and partly from Lister-Turner & Clark’s glosses.

<a id="table-11.15"> </a>

: __Table 11.15__ Motu month names

[6-11-5-2-330-pt-motu-guiraura](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-5-2-330-pt-motu-guiraura)

The Motu sailed their _laɣatoi_ (double-hulled canoes) annually westward to the Gulf of Papua to trade with the Elema. They would wait for the mid-year wind change, then sail back to their villages (around present-day Port Moresby). These trading voyages were known as _hiri_, also used as the month name for a period roughly corrresponding to July. The names for January and October also seem to be associated with these voyages. The term _maura_ (part of the month name for October) is glossed by Lister-Turner & Clark as

> s.t. small given as a pledge, to remind recipient of his promise to return; a token that the messenger who brings it has been sent by the owner, an Elema man who sails on a _laɣatoi_ and stays till next year.

The ‘promise to return’ probably alludes to a man’s pledge to his Elema trading partner to return the following year. ‘An Elema man who sails on a _laɣatoi_ and stays till next year’ is almost self-explanatory: he is a man from the Gulf who is transported on the _laɣatoi_ to its owner’s Motu village, and remains there as a guest until he can return to the Gulf on next year’s _hiri_.

Sinaugoro, to the east of Motu, shares some month names with Motu, but none that are associated with the _hiri_, in which Sinaugoro speakers did not traditionally participate. Instead, names peculiar to Sinaugoro often reflect the fact that its speakers live in the savanna. Whether the names shared with Motu are loans or shared inheritances is difficult to know, as the languages are phonologically similar. [Table 11.16](#table-11.16) is drawn from two sources, [Kolia](Source#cldf:Kolia1975) ([1975](Source#cldf:Kolia1975)) and [Tauberschmidt](Source#cldf:Tauberschmidt2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:Tauberschmidt2007)). Kolia’s data are from the Balawaia dialect. He does not assign his month names to western calendar months, but does gloss them. Tauberschmidt on the other hand, whose month names are from the Saroa dialect, assigns them to western months, but does not gloss them further. Some glosses, marked (R) (= Ross), are inferred from Kolia’s and Tauberschmidt’s vocabularies.

[6-11-5-2-331-pt-balawaia-manubada](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-5-2-331-pt-balawaia-manubada)

The range of names in [Table 11.16](#table-11.16) demonstrates that month names even in dialects of the same language can diverge quite widely. It also reveals how culture-specific month names can be. Where some Motu names reference seafaring, names from the Balawaia dialect reference a grass species and burning in the surrounding savanna. Both dialects refer to the end of the harvest in April and the beginning of a new crop in May.

Both dialects also include _manu-bada_, perhaps the ‘big bird’ constellation of Sirius, Canopus, Procyon, Betelgeuse and Rigel described in [vol.2(168](ContributionTable?anchor=p-168#cldf:2-6)–170), which Tauberschmidt assigns to January. Immediately after sunset in January this huge constellation dominates the eastern sky over the Motu and Sinaugoro villages. That ‘big’ has its Motu shape _bada_ rather than Sinaugoro _bara_ suggests that it may be a loan.


<a id="p-332"></a>

[Clunn and Kolia](Source#cldf:ClunnandKolia1977) ([1977](Source#cldf:ClunnandKolia1977):143) list thirteen month names for closely related Lala, situated to the west of Motu. The name for the thirteenth Lala month, _avala_, is literally ‘north-west’, reflecting POc _&ast;apaRat_ ‘northwest wind; wet season when westerlies blow and sea is rough’ ([vol.2:129](ContributionTable?anchor=p-129#cldf:2-5)). This is cognate with Sinaugoro _avala_, occurring in two month names. Otherwise no Lala month name is cognate with either a Motu or a Sinaugoro month name.

#### 5.3.1. Nakanai


Chowning (2016) lists eight lunar month names from Nakanai, on the north coast of New Britain. The eight are considered a complete set, and their ordering is clear, running from _e tolo bubu_ ‘1st moon of the calendar year, approx. Sep.–Oct. (starts about autumn equinox)’ to _e sakalu kea_ (lit. ‘white reef’) ‘8th and last moon—actually several moons of the same name, approx. June–Sep.’ Apart from the 8th month, the names are, as far as we can tell, untranslatable, and there is no discussion apart from brief descriptions included in the dictionary entries.

#### 5.3.2. Barok


[Wagner](Source#cldf:Wagner1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Wagner1986)) describes the timing of the gardening cycle in Barok, New Ireland. He writes that “a cycle of six named lunations seems to have been recognised, and used in conjunction with gardening, in pre-European days.” (1986:38). His own observations and his conversations with Barok speakers about the traditional calendar lead him to conclude that the _awat ni nien_ ‘season of plenty’ and the _awat nere loŋ_ ‘season of hunger’ each represent a six-month cycle, but because the large garden is planted only four months after the small (see [Table 11.18](#table-11.18)), the gardening calendar cannot be described within a single six-month cycle. He points out that the Barok observe lunar, solar and sidereal events (1986:41), which do not correspond exactly. However, he concludes that each _awat_ effectively begins at the new moon closest to when the Pleiades are crossing the meridian, i.e. in the evening on 21 February and predawn on 22 August. The position of the sun around these dates is also not far from its position at the solstice.

[Table 11.18](#table-11.18) is the table given by Wagner but augmented from the text (1986:36–44). Since the Barok reckoned time in terms of six-month seasons, the same set of six months occurs in each _awat_, i.e. twice in a year, a unit that the Barok were allegedly unaware of. The blanks in the “Gardening” column of the table are due partly to the fact that Wagner’s table includes them, but partly to the fact that Wagner does not mention the harvests. The numbers in the leftmost column represent the month whose second half falls into this lunation, e.g. 01 represents the latter part of January and the earlier part of February.

We note that this account contains one oddity: since the months in each _awat_ have the same names, _tege ni kuka_ ‘moon of crabs’ occurs twice a year. In reality, however, land crab spawning ([§ 11.4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-8#cldf:6-11)) occurs only once a year, presumably in November. This leads to the speculations that the Barok were aware of the annual cycle (as the distribution of garden planting described by Wagner also implies) and that the six-month cycle represents a reduction of a set of terms that once covered the year.


<a id="p-334"></a>

Particular importance is attached by the Barok to the Pleiades. In one _marana-kai_ they are crossing the meridian at dusk on 21 February, but have already been prominent in the evening sky for about a month. In the other _marana-kai_ they are crossing the meridian at dawn on 22 August, and will remain prominent in the pre-dawn sky for about a month.[^21] This account is puzzling, as Western Oceanic speakers typically make no use of the meridian (it is not clear how they would identify it). A possibility is that Barok speakers observed the risings and settings of the Pleiades. Their apparent first pre-dawn rising around 7 June would very roughly fit the beginning of _awat nere loŋ_ ‘season of hunger’, and their apparent pre-dawn setting around 5 November would be a herald of the monsoon and the _awat ni nien_ ‘season of plenty’.

### 5.4. Southeast Solomons


Sets of lunar months have been recorded for Gela ([Fox 1955](Source#cldf:Fox1955)), To’aba’ita ([Lichtenberk 2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)), Sa’a ([Ivens 1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918), [1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927)), Kwaio ([Keesing 1975](Source#cldf:Keesing1975)) and Arosi ([Fox 1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)). Other dictionaries including ’Are’are ([Geerts 1970](Source#cldf:Geerts1970)) and Owa ([Mellow 2014](Source#cldf:Mellow2014)) contain partial lists. Except for Gela, these languages belong to the Malaita-Makira subgroup of SES.

[6-11-5-4-334-ses-saa-huleilade](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-5-4-334-ses-saa-huleilade)

The most comprehensive of these lists is [Ivens’](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):396-397) for Sa’a, shown in [Table 11.19](#table-11.19), which varies in some respects from that in [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1918) ([1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918)). In 1927 he describes the year as “beginning with the flowers of the canarium almond in September (_hule i lade_ ‘flowers arrive’) and ending with the period of ripe almonds (_ŋali maelo_) in August”.[^22] August is also called _ro hutohuto_ ‘froth, foam’, referring to the month of wild weather and big seas. (In Arosi the same month is referred to as _waro ŋavara_ ‘rough weather month’.) Four months – October to December – are prefaced by _oku_, the palolo worm, while three – April to June – are prefaced by _loʔa_ (meaning unknown, but used also as month name prefix in Lau (_loa_) and possibly in To’aba’ita (_loʔi_). Ivens describes the _loʔa_ months as relating to ‘the yam harvest which is dug about the beginning of May’.

A comparison of month names across languages shows broad agreement in Gela, Sa’a, Arosi and ’Are’are with respect to the palolo months, although both Sa’a and ’Are’are give the name for the palolo to four months, suggesting it now means something like ‘month, season’. SES palolo month names are listed in [§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11).

### 5.5. Vanuatu


Unusually detailed lists of month names are available for the Torres and Banks islands of northern Vanuatu, thanks to various anthropological studies ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) for Mota, [Durrad 1940](Source#cldf:Durrad1940) and [Mondragón 2004](Source#cldf:Mondragon2004) for the Loh dialect of Lo-Toga, [François 2023](Source#cldf:Francois2023) for Mwotlap, and François pers. comm. for Lo, Mota, Mwotlap and partial Mwesen). They are summarised in [Table 11.20](#table-11.20).[^23]

In the leftmost column of [Table 11.20](#table-11.20) numbers approximate western months. Terms for October, November and December in Loh, Mota and Mwotlap make reference to the small and big risings of the palolo ([§11.4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-3#cldf:6-11)). Loh appears to be out of sync with Mota and Mwotlap by a month, but this probably reflects the vague relationship between western months and the lunar months labelled here.

According to Durrad, five Loh months, from April to August, are named for the seasonal Panax grass called _moɣot_, which springs up as winter ends (cf [§11.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-6#cldf:6-11)). In April the grass is fresh (_meta_ ‘wet’) and in May it dries off (_reŋ_ ‘dry’). The name continues to be associated with the next three months—becoming a seasonal name now associated with digging up first the yam-like _təmeɣ_ in June and then the _kʷɛtə_ in July. A further five months, from November to March, are named for the palolo worm, _n’ut_. As with _moɣot_ the name continues beyond the true palolo months, becoming a seasonal name. Durrad also links each month with gardening activity, and at times, as in June and July, this is reflected in the month name. As planting is carried out in September and October, the yam vines are in full green in February and turning rusty red in March, giving rise to the terms for green and red in their respective month names. Yam harvesting occurs in May, the _təmeɣ_ [wild yam] and _kʷɛtə_ mentioned above reaching maturity later than cultivated yams.

In Mota, as there are many more month names than can be fitted into a lunar year, the list given is a selection among the possible names. Included are three maɣoto months, May to July, two rara months, August and September, and three palolo (un) months, October to December. The _maɣoto_ month of May is translated as ‘fresh grass’, equivalent with Loh ‘wet grass’. [Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):350) writes that, for Mota, _maɣoto_ and _rara_, the erythrina or coral tree (from POc _&ast;rarap_, [vol.3:158](ContributionTable?anchor=p-158#cldf:3-5), 257) have become seasonal terms for summer and winter respectively, roughly equating with the annual division of the Loh calendar (cf [§11.4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-6#cldf:6-11)).

The Mota, Mwotlap and partial Mwesen calendars display more similarity with each other than any of them does with Loh. The three make similar references, even when the terms are not cognate. The terms for April, however, are cognate, reflecting what François (pers. comm.) reconstructs as Proto Banks _&ast;lamʷas-aki dorodoro_, apparently a serial verb construction consisting of _&ast;lamʷas-_ ‘to hit, strike’, the applicative suffix _&ast;-aki_, hence ‘strike against’, and _dorodoro_ ‘to rattle’. The meaning of the construction is evidently ‘to strike against so that it rattles’, the agent being the wind, the patient the reed-like grass _Miscanthus floridulus_ which makes a rattling sound when the dry reeds, blown by the wind, strike each other (François, pers. comm.).

The terms for January, February and March in Mota, Mwotlap and Mwesen all make oblique reference to the (monsoon) winds, in Mwotlap and Mwesen striking the reeds, and in Mota, _vusi-aru_ [beats casuarina], where the wind instead strikes the casuarina (_aru_). The terms for January refer to the reeds thickening (Mwesen _revsos_), budding (Mwotlap _ni-witɣoy_) and flowering (Mota _wotɣoro_). In February the reeds are preparing to expel their seeds. In Mwesen they _ristek taqan_ ‘grab hold’ (of their bellies, like pregnant women), and in Mwotlap they _towowoh_ ‘burst open’. In March the wind blows so hard that in Mota fragments of the reeds break off and fly away (_tete_), while in Mwesen it ‘blows off white hair’ (whether the hair belongs to the reeds or the old men is uncertain). François has no gloss for the Mwotlap terms, but it is probable that _tit_ is cognate with Mota _tete_ ‘fly away’.

Lest the explanation for the abbreviated sentences used as month names here appear too imaginative, it is worth noting that Codrington & Palmer’s dictionary entries tell the same story as François recorded from Mwotlap and Mwesen speakers.

[Codrington](Source#cldf:Codrington1891) ([1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):349) warns that in Mota

> it is impossible to fit the native succession of moons into a solar year; months have their names from what is done and what happens when the moon appears and while it lasts; the same moon has different names. If all the names of moons in use in one language were set in order the periods of time would overlap, and the native year would be artificially made up of twenty or thirty months.

The reason for Codrington’s warning is that Mota months were named not only for the palolo and the effect of the seasons on wild plants as in [Table 11.8](#table-11.8) but also for periods in the yam cycle. It would be possible to list month names in order from April to December that referred to events from preparing the yam garden to planting, maturing, harvesting and clearing.

Because there are some cognate forms among these languages, it is possible to reconstruct three lunar month names for Proto Torres-Banks, using [Clark’s](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) orthography, and partially reconstruct two others.[^24]

[Proto Torres-Banks &ast;_mʷakoto raŋo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-5-338-ProtoTorresBanks-makotorao-a)

Lists of names are available to us from three Malakula languages: Atchin, Naman and Avava. However, these display almost no cognate forms either with each other or with the Torres-Banks languages. The exceptions are Atchin _ul wele_ ‘little palolo’ and _ul lɛp_ ‘great palolo, October–November’. Moreover, [Capell & Layard](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980)) contains nineteen Atchin ‘month’ names, whilst in Avava the year is divided into just eight periods. Clearly, these are not strictly lunar month terms.

Also available are lists of month names from southern Vanuatu: Sye, Kwamera, Lenakel and Anejom. However, apart from a brief discussion of Sye names by [Crowley](Source#cldf:Crowley1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Crowley1998)), the names are compiled from dictionaries without ethnographic description or interpretation of their meanings. There are almost no cognates, even between Kwamera and Lenakel, the two languages from Tanna island.

### 5.6. Fiji


[Hale](Source#cldf:Hale1846) ([1846](Source#cldf:Hale1846):68) offers a list of twelve names for Fijian lunar months obtained from missionary sources, with two (February and March) referring to flowering of the _ŋasau_ reed (Miscanthus floridulus), three (April-June) referring to garden cultivation, two (October, November) to the palolo and two (December, January) to the _nuga_, a rabbitfish (_Siganus vermiculatus_). However, he comments

> Besides the appearance of the _mbalolo_, the natives have few means of determining with exactness the progress of time. Indeed, they pay little attention to this, and we were unable to obtain from several to whom we applied, the names of the months in their regular series. … The Feejeeans know nothing of astronomy, and have not even names for the most important constellations.

Seemann (1862:296-299) refers more confidently to “the eleven months into which the calendar is divided”, quoting “an intelligent Bauan chief and the consular interpreter.” He comments that “the names given by me, as well as their succession, do not quite agree with those given by Wilkes (i.e. Hale from the Wilkes expedition). The names of the months may also be different in different parts of the group”. However, the list in [Table 11.21](#table-11.21) from Seemann, including his comments, substantially mirrors the horticultural/faunal/floral annual cycle, and accords with later broad descriptions such as those of [Hocart](Source#cldf:Hocart1929) ([1929](Source#cldf:Hocart1929)) for the Lau Islands of eastern Fiji and [Pawley and Sayaba](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022) ([2022](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022)) for Wayan, spoken in western Fiji.[^25]

He notes that Hazlewood, who published a Fijian–English dictionary in 1850, allowed four months, from May to August, to be effectively the clearing month. Presumably this provided the degree of flexibility necessary so that the more precise seasonal events such as the rising of the palolo occur at the expected time.


<a id="s-5-7"></a>

### 5.7. Micronesia


In passing from Fiji to Micronesia we encounter a change in the way the year is envisioned. In Micronesia, unlike the other areas examined, there is internal consistency in that stars, and stars alone, are seen to mark the passing of time. All month names reconstructed are star or constellation names ([vol.2:166](ContributionTable?anchor=p-166#cldf:2-6)–184), reflecting a calendar with a smooth transition from one star or star cluster to the next. [Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970):37–38) writes that in Woleai “the seasons and their subdivision of months or moons (_maram_) are initiated by the rising and setting of designated stars.” The months that define the winter (approximately November to April) and summer (approximately May to October) seasons are all named after the star or star grouping which heralds the beginning of the period (1970:38). As names of months the Micronesian terms are strictly speaking only reconstructable for PChk, based on month names for Truk (= Chuuk) ([Goodenough & Sugita 1990](Source#cldf:GoodenoughandSugita1990)), Mortlock and Lamotrek ([Christian 1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899)), Ponape ([Kubary 1895](Source#cldf:Kubary1895); [Christian 1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899)), Woleai ([Alkire 1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970)), Carolinian ([Jackson & Marck 1991](Source#cldf:JacksonandMarck1991)), Puluwat ([Elbert 1972](Source#cldf:Elbert1972)) and Sonsorol ([Capell 1969](Source#cldf:Capell1969)). However, some of the terms have non-Chuukic cognates within Micronesia and are reconstructable at least as star or constellation names as far back as PMic. PChk reconstructions are given here in the same orthography as PMic, that of [Jackson](Source#cldf:Jackson1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Jackson1986)). Terms from Mortlock and Lamotrek are given in the orthographies of their sources, as we have insufficient information to convert them to the orthography otherwise used in this volume.


<a id="p-340"></a>

Speakers from the Polynesian outlier island of Kapingamarangi, which lies roughly midway between Mussau and the Caroline Islands of Micronesia, have largely adopted the Chuukic calendar, ten of their twelve months according in order with the Micronesian listing ([Elbert 1948](Source#cldf:Elbert1948)). These are treated as borrowings. A single Kapingamarangi month, _matariki_, accords with a Polynesian term.

Sources for Puluwat and Carolinian each list twelve names and link them to western months; those for Mortlock, Lamotrek and Sonsorol list months in regular sequence from one to twelve. The Trukese Dictionary lists fourteen names as months in the traditional sidereal calendar, only four of which are numerically ordered. An additional one is listed as ‘named for a month in some calendars’. Some of the cognates in the sets listed below include star names that are not month names. Sixteen PChk terms have been reconstructed that, taken in sequence, albeit with some overlap, represent a solar year. Of these, four (Leo, Corona Borealis, Vega and Andromeda) are represented as month names in only two or three languages, and are regarded as probably substitutions for other nearby stars or star clusters.

Because each year the new moon rises eleven days earlier than in the previous year, the time of year thus delineated moves between two adjacent western months.[^26]

We have no clear evidence that any star or star cluster is regarded in the Chuukic group as heralding a new year. Christian begins his list with Leo for Mortlock and Corvus for Lamotrek, while Capell also starts with Corvus for Sonsorol, i.e. roughly September or October, but neither author discusses his choice. In Woleai the star Arcturus, identified with November, is identified as marking the change of seasons from summer to winter while Pegasus, identified with May, gives its name to the summer season. Because of its dominant role elsewhere in the Oceanic world we begin our list with the Pleiades.

[Proto Chuukic-Ponapeic &ast;_mʷakariker_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-7-340-ProtoChuukicPonapeic-makariker-a)

It is tempting to try to associate this with PPn _&ast;mataliki_ ‘Pleiades’ (lit. ‘small eyes’), but this is apparently a chance resemblance.

There is some overlap in associating the next two reconstructions with roughly the same month. Although Lamotrek and Sonsorol attribute terms to two successive months, Mortlock combines both for the same month. [Christian](Source#cldf:Christian1899) ([1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899):393) does, however, offer alternative Mortlock terms. Aldebaran and Orion’s Belt are close together in the night sky, and both could be identified with the same time of year.

Although the next set takes its name from the giant Bird constellation, which covers a considerable area of the sky, it is the appearance of its brightest star, Sirius, that is most consistently identified with the moon rising in September.

<a id="p-343"></a>

According to [Christian](Source#cldf:Christian1899) ([1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899):389), Lamotrek _sorabol_ is derived from _sor_ ‘look’ and _bol_ ‘taro patch’ and means ‘viewer of the taro patches’ because it shines during the taro season.

[PChk &ast;_aremoi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-7-343-PChk-aremoi-a)

Lamotrek _aramoi_ is allegedly derived from _ara_ ‘conclude’ and _moi_ ‘come’, as the ascendancy of Arcturus marks the end of the NE winds that bring visiting parties to the island ([Christian 1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899):389).

<a id="p-344"></a>

It is tempting to associate the next reconstruction with PPn _&ast;mataliki_ ‘Pleiades’ (lit. ‘small eyes’), but the similarity is evidently accidental.

[PMic &ast;_māti-ciki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-7-344-PMic-maticiki-a)

[Christian](Source#cldf:Christian1899) ([1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899)) attributes this constellation name in Mortlock to stars in Hercules, but the star chart suggests that Abo et al (1976) are correct in assigning it to stars in Sagittarius, as there is nowhere near a month’s difference between Antares (the previous month) and Hercules.

[PChk &ast;_məəl_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-7-344-PChk-ml-a)

The next reconstruction, literally ‘big mati’ contrasts with PMic _&ast;mati-ciki_ above, ‘small _mati_’ (meaning of _mati_ unknown). [Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Elbert1972)) attributes the meaning ‘big/old breadfruit’ to the Puluwat term, since the Puluwat breadfruit season lasts from May until December (_mæy_ > PROc _&ast;maRi_ ‘breadfruit’). However, there is clear support for PMic _&ast;mati-_ as the first element.

[Christian](Source#cldf:Christian1899) ([1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899):394) records Yapese orthographic _lagu_ (probably _laxu_) for a month around June. If this is an early borrowing from a Micronesian language, the PMic form was probably _&ast;laku_.

[PWMic &ast;_laka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-7-345-PWMic-laka-a)

PChk _&ast;kua_ below evidently reflects PMic _&ast;kua_ ‘Dolphin constellation, a constellation including Cassiopeia and approximately equivalent to Aries’ ([vol.2:170](ContributionTable?anchor=p-170#cldf:2-6)).

<a id="p-347"></a>

The PChk reconstructions in [Table 11.22](#table-11.22) show a smooth progression of rising stars over a year. Carolinian, Chuukese, Mortlock, Puluwat, Woleaian, Lamotrek and Sonsorol follow this sequence closely, each containing reflexes of 12 of the 16 reconstructions, although varying slightly as to which are not represented. The four star clusters marked with an asterisk are those listed as calendar stars in only two or three languages and are probably alternatives for other close stars representing the same period.

The only Micronesian language outside western Micronesia (Marshallese + Chuukic) in which terms for divisions of a year have been located is Kiribati, which has a rather different sidereal calendar. [Grimble](Source#cldf:Grimble1931) ([1931](Source#cldf:Grimble1931)) provides a detailed account of Gilbertese [Kiribati] astronomy. The year is considered to begin with the appearance of the Pleiades about 15 degrees above the eastern horizon just after sunset, in about the first week of December. The Kiribati uniquely use the rafters of the meeting house as a grid reference by which they locate their stars. Each six-monthly season is subdivided into eight periods called _boŋ_, measured by the successive altitudes of the seasonal star at the hour after sunset as observed through the grid of the rafters of the meeting house (1931:200). These sixteen named divisions, each a little over three weeks long, subvert any need for a calendar based on lunar months.

### 5.8. Polynesia



<a id="s-5-8-1"></a>

#### 5.8.1. Organisation of the lunar calendar


Lunar calendars are ubiquitous in Polynesia, or at least were, prior to the introduction of the western calendar. Names commonly recur, theoretically permitting reconstruction to PPn, but comparison of lists shows immediate problems. [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941):97–98) has noted that different islands of the Hawaiian group use more or less the same month names, but in different orders. Not only do starting months differ, but the order of months is often scrambled. The same is true of lists from Tahiti, Samoa, Tokelau and the Marquesas. Some calendars consist of twelve months, others thirteen, while some, including Tonga, Manihiki, Tahiti and Hawaii, have a thirteenth month interspersed occasionally. East Futuna has fourteen months recorded but this apparently occurs because two months, December and January, each have two names, presumed alternatives, listed. [Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):310) comment that


<a id="p-348"></a>

> since … the original calendar was strongly correlated with local ecological conditions and with yam horticulture, it is not surprising that the calendar was significantly reorganised once people had left the homeland region, and once their ecological settings and horticultural practices had changed.

A further explanation for these discrepancies comes from [Gill](Source#cldf:Gill1876) ([1876](Source#cldf:Gill1876):317) in his description of lunar months on Mangaia in the southern Cook Islands:

> The knowledge of the calendar belonged to the kings, as they alone fixed the feasts in honour of the gods, and all public spectacles. For others to dare to keep the calendar was a sin against the gods, to be punished by hydrocele [drowning?].

This perhaps explains why many lists have been recorded with a degree of doubt by the informant as to their veracity. Even the earliest records show a degree of uncertainty, as in the following 1789 account from Bligh who sought lunar month lists from Tahiti (quoted by [Oliver 1974](Source#cldf:Oliver1974):268):


<a id="p-349"></a>

> To get a certain Knowledge of their division of time has given me much trouble, for altho many people pretend to know it, Yet I have found them so contradictory in their Accounts as convinced me they were not acquainted with the particulars of it. Tynah assured me only a few Old People could give me any information and that he knew it but very imperfectly himself.

For practical purposes the account here relies on [Williamson](Source#cldf:Williamson1933) ([1933](Source#cldf:Williamson1933)) and Collacott (1922) for Tongan, [Rensch](Source#cldf:Rensch1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Rensch1986)) (based on Grézel 1878) for East Futunan, [Williamson](Source#cldf:Williamson1933) ([1933](Source#cldf:Williamson1933)) (based on [Turner 1884](Source#cldf:Turner1884)) for Samoan, [Besnier](Source#cldf:Besnier1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:Besnier1981)) (based on [Kennedy 1931](Source#cldf:Kennedy1931)) for Tuvalu, [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941)) for Manihiki, [Williamson](Source#cldf:Williamson1933) ([1933](Source#cldf:Williamson1933)) for Tokelauan, [Gill](Source#cldf:Gill1876) ([1876](Source#cldf:Gill1876)) for Mangaia, [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941)) for Penrhyn, [Oliver](Source#cldf:Oliver1974) ([1974](Source#cldf:Oliver1974)) for Tahiti, and [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941)) for Hawaii.

Comparison of these lists shows frequent recurrence of lunar month names, but some diversity in the month attributed to each name. While reconstruction of the form has been possible, its position in a sequence has proved arguable. Twenty one reconstructions of the name (but not the associated month) have been made, with 8 from Proto Polynesian, 11 from Proto Nuclear Polynesian and 2 from Proto Ellicean. There are a number of pairs, identified by _muqa_ ‘in front’ vs _muri_ ‘behind, last’ (or _toe_ ‘again’) and others by contrasting terms _kelekele_ ‘dirty’ vs _maqa_ ‘clean’ and _maquri_ ‘alive’ vs _mate_ ‘dead’. Their cognate sets appear below in [§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11).3.

A major clue in the ordering of putative PPn lunar months lies in the fact that a number of languages follow similar sequencing for up to four or five month names, as shown in [Table 11.23](#table-11.23).

The table shows the assignment to months (January = 1 etc.) of reflexes of reconstructed lunar month names in Tongan, East Futunan, Samoan, Tuvalu, Manihiki, Tokelau, Penrhyn, Tahiti, and Hawaii. It can be shown that East Futunan, Samoan, Tuvaluan, Manihiki, Tokelau and Tahiti share some sequences. These are genealogically and geographically quite widely scattered languages, and their sequencing can be taken as a good indication that the system in PPn was similarly ordered.

The difficulty then becomes one of arranging the preferred sequencing into the appropriate times of the calendar year. Names could be expected to relate to horticultural processes, particularly in parts of western Polynesia to the yam crop, or in parts of eastern Polynesia to the breadfruit season, and to the wet-dry seasons, while links to the palolo worm are prominent. There are also links to significant stars or star groups. In Futuna, for example, successive months were marked by the Pleiades, Orion’s Belt, Sirius, Regulus and a group of stars recorded as possibly the Southern Cross. In Hawaii successive months were marked by the Pleiades, Betelgeuse, Sirius and other stars whose names were not recorded. In particular, however, it is the appearance and disappearance of the Pleiades that plays a significant role in the determination of the annual calendar.

#### 5.8.2. Reconstructions


PPn _&ast;mataliki_ is reconstructable for ‘Pleiades’ ([vol.2:165](ContributionTable?anchor=p-165#cldf:2-6)), but as a month name only in PNPn (not in Tongic), where it is marked by the new moon after the first pre-dawn rising of the Pleiades which occurred in 500 BC in mid-May, so here accorded to June. As [Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):262, [Table 9.4](#table-9.4)) have noted, the risings and settings of the Pleiades were widely observed in many Polynesian societies, “where they were used to mark the change in seasons and/or to mark the commencement of the year.”


<a id="p-350"></a>

Since the internal subgrouping of Polynesian languages is relevant here, the entries below are marked either ‘Tongic’ or ‘Nuclear Polynesian’, the two first-order subgroups within Polynesian.

[PPn &ast;_mataliki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-350-PPn-mataliki-a)

PNPn _&ast;[kau]unu-unu_ is reconstructed for the next term, rather than _&ast;kaununu_. It immediately suggests a link with PChk _&ast;ūnu_ ‘late July, early August; the star Aldebaran’, and an ordering following the Pleiades and preceding Orion’s Belt as in Micronesia. The PPn prefix _&ast;kau-_ had two functions: to derive a collective noun meaning a ‘group, company, bunch of s.t.’, and to derive an instrumental noun, generally a long thin object (here PPn _&ast;kau_ < POc _&ast;kayu_ ‘tree’). The Samoan and Tahitian reflexes lack an expected initial _ʔ-_.

[PNPn &ast;_&#91;kau&#93;unu-unu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-350-PNPn-kauunuunu-a)


<a id="p-351"></a>

Strictly speaking, the next item should not be reconstructed, as it is reflected in only one language. However, it is noted here because it is a self-evident case of a (part-)constellation marking a month. Orion’s Belt is a salient three-star feature in the sky. The middle star, Alnilam, has its pre-dawn rising in late May, i.e. about two weeks after the Pleiades and a month before Sirius, which occurs as a month name for July. Hence the attribution of _&ast;tolu_ to June. Note also PChk _&ast;tolu-tolu_ ‘about August; three stars of Orion’s Belt’.

[PNPn &ast;_tolu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-351-PNPn-tolu-a)

Kirch and Green assign the two _&ast;siliŋa_ months to January and February, whereas here they are assigned to June and July. Their reasons for the former assignment are that Outlier and East Polynesian languages place them around January and February and that the second word of _&ast;siliŋa kelekele_ seems to be cognate with Fijian _kelikeli_ ‘March’. However, neither of these grounds holds strongly. Both first-order subgroups of Polynesian, To and NPn, have reflexes pointing towards June and July, whereas the January/February reflexes occur only in NPn, specifically in Outlier and East Polynesian languages which are unreliable witnesses because of their lengthy and sometimes tortuous migration histories. Tongan evidence is weighted more strongly because it lies in the Polynesian homeland. PPn _&ast;kelekele_ here means ‘dirty’, in contrast with _&ast;maqa_ ‘clean’, and is cognate with Fijian _gelegele_ ‘dirty’, not with _kelikeli_ ‘a hole dug, a ditch’ or _kele_ ‘pile up (yams)’.

Unfortunately, whilst the meanings of _&ast;kelekele_ and _&ast;maqa_ are clear, the meaning of PPn _&ast;siliŋa_ is not: it is probably a nominalisation of either PPn _&ast;sili_ ‘exceed’ or PPn _&ast;sili_ ‘put on top of’ ([Biggs & Clark 1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)). It is possible that it is derived from the latter and denotes stages of garden preparation. The Tuvaluan reflexes have each lost one word of the two-word phrase, while Hawaiian has replaced _hilina_ with _hinaia_ (a word which crops up in several month and star names). Penrhyn has adopted the pattern of other month pairs and replaced _&ast;kelekele_ and _&ast;maqa_ with reflexes of _&ast;muqa_ and _&ast;muri_. Each of these changes probably reflects the fact that speakers no longer knew the meanings of the terms.

<a id="p-352"></a>

PPn _&ast;takulua_ is readily reconstructed as the name of a bright star ([vol.2:163](ContributionTable?anchor=p-163#cldf:2-6)), and scattered reflexes in Eastern Polynesian languages indicate that this was Sirius. The NPn languages listed below are all Eastern Polynesian. It is assigned here to July on the grounds that its pre-dawn rising at Niuatoputapu occurred in late June, but this may be to project too much back to the PPn stage. In Micronesia the star Sirius is linked with September.

[PPn &ast;_takulua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-352-PPn-takulua-a)

We assign PNPn &ast;oloamanu to August (as do Kirch and Green) on the basis of its ordering relative to other months, and especially of the fact that it precedes _&ast;palolo muqa_, which cannot be assigned earlier than September. The East Polynesian data (Manihiki, Penrhyn, Marquesan and Tongarevan) are unreliable because of their lengthy and tortuous migration histories.

[PNPn &ast;_oloamanu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-352-PNPn-oloamanu-a)

In parts of Polynesia, just as in parts of western Melanesia, the palolo worm (_Eunice viridis_) spawns in a spectacular and predictable manner during October/November and November/ December during the last quarter of the moon. It is a well known phenomenon in Tonga and Samoa, as it is in Fiji, but, as far as we can tell, either does not occur or is not recognised in other parts of Polynesia. However, the name for the worm is known in Tuvalu and East Uvean at least. In East Futuna _palolo-muʔa_ and _palolo-muli_ refer to star names and thus the lunar months identified with these stars. In Tokelau, Mangaia, Tuamotu, Tahiti and no doubt other parts, the terms exist apparently only as month or seasonal names.[^28] Lack of Tongic reflexes means we cannot reconstruct these terms to PPn in spite of the fact that reflexes occur in compounds in well separated languages. PNPn _&ast;palolo muqa_ and _&ast;palolo muli_ referred to the minor and major spawnings of the palolo. More than any of the other month names, we can be reasonably sure of the chronological assignment of the palolo months because of the regular pattern of the palolo’s spawning. Their association with the wrong months, even in Samoa, indicates that they have become primarily names in a system divorced from their original meaning.

[PNPn &ast;_palolo muli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-353-PNPn-palolomuli-a)

[Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):268– 271) cite the Bauan Fijian terms _balolo lailai_ ‘small balolo’ and _balolo levu_ ‘big balolo’, respectively October and November, as external evidence for the PPn terms. Although the words for ‘small’ and ‘big’ in Fijian have been replaced in PPn by ‘be first’ and ‘be last’, this is a legitimate inference. The durability of these month names can perhaps be attributed to the co-occurrence of three events: the major palolo spawning, the last post-dusk setting of the Pleiades, and the beginning of the wet season and the season of abundance. Together, these events made _&ast;palolo muli_ a highly marked time in the Polynesian annual cycle.

Kirch and Green assign PNPn _&ast;munifa_ to December. Although the meanings of its reflexes do not give much support to this reconstructed meaning, they seem to be correct, as the month denoted by its reflexes immediately follows _&ast;palolo muri_ in E. Futunan, Samoa, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Manihiki and Tahiti. The term may be more correctly _muri-afā_ ‘end of storms’ (< POc _&ast;muri_ + _&ast;apaRat_), referring to the end of the trade-wind season. Tuvaluan _murifa_ seems to represent a halfway stage en route from PNPn _&ast;munifa_ to PEPn _&ast;muriafa_.

[PNPn &ast;_munifa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-11-5-8-354-PNPn-munifa-a)

PNPn _&ast;takaoŋa_ is attributed to January because it follows the Tuvaluan and Penrhyn month whose name reflects _&ast;muri(a)fa_. [Makemson](Source#cldf:Makemson1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Makemson1941):214) and [Pukui and Elbert](Source#cldf:PukuiElbert1971) ([1971](Source#cldf:PukuiElbert1971)) both write that it is the name of a star in Hawaii.

The next two month names contain the term _&ast;lisa_ ‘louse’s egg, nit’. [Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):271) attribute them to July and August. They cite [Collocott](Source#cldf:Collocott1922) ([1922](Source#cldf:Collocott1922):167), who explains that little protuberances (“nits”) appear on the seed yams during these months as they are forming roots. PPn _&ast;muqa_ and _&ast;muri_ respectively mean ‘be first’ and ‘be last’. Month names are instead attributed here to December and January on the basis of the glosses of their reflexes. They are at best weakly supported reconstructions.

<a id="p-355"></a>

The reconstruction of PNPn _&ast;utua muqa_ ‘January’ and PNPn _&ast;utua muli_/_&ast;toe utua_ ‘February’ is fairly straightforward, as the meanings of their component words are clear and match the horticultural season in which their glosses place them. PPn _&ast;utu_ meant ‘harvest yams’, its nominal form utua referring to ‘yam harvest’.

PNPn _&ast;tākelo_ ‘Orion’s Belt or Betelgeuse; January’ is attributed to January on a combination of clues. It appears to have referred to stars in the constellation of Orion. Whereas _&ast;tolu_ above evidently marked their pre-dawn rising in June (as does the Marquesan reflex of _&ast;tākelo_), the glosses of the Samoan (‘January’) and Nukuria (‘February’) reflexes together with a Samoan comment that this is ‘a month of wind and storms’ ([Henry 1928](Source#cldf:Henry1928):234), imply that _&ast;tākelo_ referred to the post-dusk rising of the stars in Orion’s Belt in December.

Kirch and Green interpret PPn _&ast;wai muqa_ and _&ast;wai muri_, where _&ast;wai_ is ‘fresh water’ or ‘rain water’, as referring to the months at the end of the wet season. The three Sa’a (SES) months which make reference to _wai_ ‘fresh water’: Feb. _loʔa wai mʷai-mʷai_ ‘small water’, March _loʔa wai paine_ ‘big water’ and April _loʔa wai_ (meaning of _loʔa_ unknown) also fall in the same period ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927)).

[Kirch and Green’s](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):272) reconstructions for the next two months contain the word _&ast;faka-qafu_ ‘cause to be heaped up’ (_&ast;faka-_ ‘causative’ + _&ast;qafu_ ‘[be a] heap’). They take this to denote the preparation of gardens for yam planting at the beginning of the dry season. However, the Tongan and East Futunan reflexes point to PPn _&ast;faka-afu_ (_&ast;afu_ ‘shoot or sucker’).

It seems that the Polynesians were more systematic than speakers in western Melanesia in tying names specifically to lunar months rather than just to times of year. Although we have established a more or less sequential order of month names, we need to be cautious. Perhaps we need to be reminded here that a) the idea of a year as a fixed period of time did not exist for early Oceanic speakers (note Williams’ Maori definition of _tau_ as ‘season, year, the recurring cycle being the predominating idea rather than the definite time measurement’), and b) times identified within a year were identified not by their length but rather by their central focus. It is easy but mistaken to read the lists through western eyes, and interpret them as fully equivalent to western calendar months. The interpretation is reinforced because we have little option other than to translate local terms for time of year either with western month names or by numbering lunar months from 1 to 12, with an arbitrary starting point. But there was no attempt by local speakers to fit the lunar months into a fixed period of time. The lists were not fixed; rather they were ready lists of more or less sequential markers of time within an annual cycle that could be moved or added to if moons became out of step with natural features.

Two particular checkpoints – the rising and setting Pleiades and the palolo rising – are those around which most people fitted their month names. The first are fixed in their annual cycle, the second move to and fro according to the lunar cycle. The palolo rising is thus separated from the others by slightly variable periods, with the result that the number of moons between these markers sometimes varies. If one had to be omitted early, another could be slotted in later, maintaining more or less the same reference to the agricultural cycle. But their sequencing could not be fully fixed.


<a id="p-358"></a>

What we have reconstructed, therefore, is a lunar month calendar with assumed built-in flexibility. [Kirch & Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):271) have also reconstructed a list, varying from ours in some of its month assignments and in the interstage to which a number of terms are reconstructed. Under our analysis fairly complete sets of month names are reconstructed for PNPn and PEPn, and a partial set for PPn. The two calendars are reproduced as [Table 11.24](#table-11.24), where “<” means ‘a reflex of the term to the left’.

As the rightmost column of the table shows, month names are largely a mixture of agricultural terms and star names. However, none of the PPn terms as reconstructed here are star names, and it is a reasonable speculation that PPn had a set of month names based on the yam cycle, the weather and the palolo risings, and that star names replaced some of these as Polynesian speakers moved further eastward and left their yam-growing culture behind them.

## 6. Moon phases


Sets of moon phase terms in Oceanic languages show considerable variety. This may be due in part to the possible incompleteness of sets that have been retrieved from entries scattered across a dictionary. Even so, this variety shows certain patterns, described below, but providing only vague pointers to the POc set. No cognate sets have been found, except among very closely related languages. The two phases that are most often named are the full moon and the new moon. The latter raises a glossing snag that we return to in [§11.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-2#cldf:6-11).


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Full moon and associated terms


One piece of evidence that month names primarily label full moons ([§11.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5#cldf:6-11)) is found in the distribution of moon phase terms. Almost all available moon phase sets have a term for ‘full moon’. Some WOc languages (Dobu, Manam, Halia) have no other phase terms listed. Other languages have terms that cluster around or after the full moon, and these are shown in [Table 11.25](#table-11.25). The leftmost column numbers the approximate[^29] nights of a lunar month, counting the western “new moon” (the night when the moon does not appear) as ‘1’ and the night it is last seen before the next “new moon” as ‘30’. The second column labels the phases by their conventional western names.

A striking feature of [Table 11.25](#table-11.25) is the number of empty cells in it. Kilivila and Maringe ([Table 11.26](#table-11.26)) also have a set of moon phase terms, but not the remaining languages. The blanks highlight the fact that each of these languages has names for the days in a sequence that includes the full moon,[^30] but no names for the rest of the days of the month.[^31] Evidently, the time around the full moon was the most important part of the lunar cycle in these communities, and the full moon was (at least until recently) still celebrated through the night in some Oceanic communities.[^32]

The only cognate terms for ‘full moon’ are Kokota _ɣlaba nare_ and Maringe _ɣlaba-rane_, literally ‘moon daylight’. Roviana _hobo rimata_ evidently has similar sense, as _rimata_ means ‘sun’ (the meaning of _hobo_ is unknown). Many terms for ‘full moon’ and other moon phases are partly or wholly unglossable, but the available terms reveal certain semantic patterns. In many languages ‘full moon’ is ‘moon’ plus an attribute meaning ‘all, whole, entire’.

Beyond these semantically obvious terms, a number of metaphorical expressions are found, some, no doubt, making references that cannot be retrieved. Indeed, some of the unglossable terms for ‘full moon’ presumably fall into this category.

### 6.2. New moon


The vast majority of Oceanic languages also have a term for ‘new moon’. However, there is a terminological snag here. The western “new moon” anachronistically denotes the time when there is no visible moon in the sky. This is also true of some Oceanic languages, but in at least some of these this reflects post-contact western influence (and the term is a word-for-word translation of ‘new moon’). In others, it is clear from its literal meaning that the term glossed ‘new moon’ actually denotes the very first trace of a waxing crescent moon. In Longgu, for example, we find _madamai vaolu-i_ [moon new-DEF], calqued on the English term and contrasting with _tada madamai_ [face-up moon] ‘new moon’, which evidently denotes the first visible trace of the moon’s crescent rising convex edge upward, as seen from a few degrees south of the equator.

Terms for a night when no moon appears usually refer to darkness or contain a verb alluding to the moon’s absence.

<a id="p-361"></a>

Terms for a newly appeared moon, a very thin crescent, fall into three groups. In the first group are expressions that mean ‘the moon is rising’ or ‘the moon is appearing’:

[6-11-6-2-361-nng-mangap-puluipet](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-2-361-nng-mangap-puluipet)

The second group has glosses that refer to the ‘immaturity’ of the moon:

[6-11-6-2-361-mm-nehan-koburubialoko](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-2-361-mm-nehan-koburubialoko)

The third group uses metaphors denoting the appearance of the young moon:

<a id="s-6-3"></a>

### 6.3. Half moon


Fewer languages have a term for the half moon (the ‘quarter moon’ in western phase terminology) and a number of them mean ‘a piece of the moon’.

[6-11-6-3-361-adm-drehet-kisiepu](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-3-361-adm-drehet-kisiepu)


<a id="s-6-4"></a>

### 6.4. Sets of phase terms


Setting aside phase term sets that only have terms for the new moon and the full moon, phase term sets fall into two types. Type 1 sets include terms that indicate whether the moon is waxing or waning. Terms in a type 2 set describe only the shape of the moon (so that, for example, a waxing half moon and a waning half moon are both described by a single term). Strictly speaking, the latter are not phase terms proper, but shape terms. Both types include terms for full moon and for new moon, and it would be possible to divide the terms in [§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:6-11) and [§11.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-2#cldf:6-11) into phase terms and shape terms, but we have elected not to do so, partly because there are full and new moon terms that have no explanatory gloss.

Sets of both types differ along another dimension, namely how many phases or shapes they distinguish. This presupposes that the source from which we derive each set includes all members of that language’s set. The sets in [§11.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-4#cldf:6-11) are each made up of phase terms, but these are short phases clustering around the full moon. [Table 11.26](#table-11.26) is a tabulation of the Maringe moon phase terms found in various entries in [White et al.](Source#cldf:Whiteetal1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Whiteetal1988)).


<a id="p-362"></a>

Maringe terms for specific days cluster after the new moon and full moon, and the remaining terms cover the periods in between. Where other meanings for the terms are known, these are shown in the column headed ‘Glosses’. Some are descriptive, like _khakla-fagalo_ ‘hibiscus leaf’ = waxing gibbous moon, and _ɣlaba-rane_ ‘daylight moon’ = full moon. Others are perhaps drawn from narratives associated with the moon, e.g. _kakhana-ɣolihe_ ‘the spirit reappears’ = second day of the waxing crescent moon, and _faŋala-baʔesu_ ‘the shark bites’ = second day of the waning gibbous moon. The likelihood that the latter belongs to a narrative is supported by an alternative term for the previous night, _fafiau-fihalu baʔesu_, glossed by White et al. as “‘shark sniffs (the moon)’ as it waits under cover of darkness for the moon to rise”. The Maringe term for the western ninth day (first quarter) appears odd, as it contains the word _fitu_ ‘seven’, but White et al. explain that it marks the seventh day (the middle) of the period between _bugaɣra_, the first crescent moon, and the full moon, i.e. the seventh day if the day following _bugaɣra_, i.e. _kakhana-ɣolihe_, is counted as the first.

The Maringe set nicely illustrates the use of metaphor and of allusion to narrative in Oceanic moon phase terms, and shows why the origins of moon phase terms may often be lost to us. It is either a more elaborated or a less eroded set of moon phase terms than those found in many Oceanic languages. A more usual set comes from the Kavataria dialect of Kilivila (PT) (Ralph Lawton, pers. comm.):

[6-11-6-4-362-pt-kilivila-kapatu](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-4-362-pt-kilivila-kapatu)


<a id="p-363"></a>

Another set comes from Motu (PT). Note the clustering of terms after the full moon, some- what like the sets in [Table 11.25](#table-11.25).

[6-11-6-4-363-pt-motu-doai](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-4-363-pt-motu-doai)

[Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk2008)) includes the following To’aba’ita (SES) terms. These are verbs, forming clauses like _madami e siki_ [moon it small] ‘it’s new moon’. Note the second stage of waxing, which can be glossed as ‘like a hibiscus leaf’, semantically the label that Maringe applies to the same phase.

[6-11-6-4-363-ses-toabaita-siki](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-4-363-ses-toabaita-siki)

Similar sets evidently occur further east, but the data are sparse. The Mwotlap (NCV) set consists of clauses with the subject _no-wol_ ‘the moon’ —

[6-11-6-4-363-ncv-mwotlap-nowoltgyw](cf.csv#cldf:6-11-6-4-363-ncv-mwotlap-nowoltgyw)

The seemingly most articulated set of Oceanic moon phase terms is found in Hawaiian, where every day of the lunar cycle has a name, as in [Table 11.27](#table-11.27). However, a little deconstruction shows that a number of the phase terms fall into smaller sets, and the days within each set are numbered. Thus days 4–6 share _kū-_ ‘stand’, giving _kū-kahi_ [stand-1], _kū-lua_ [stand-2], _kū-kolu_ [stand-3], _kū-pau_ [stand-last]. The _ʔole-ku-_ ‘not stand’ set for days 8–11 recurs, counting again from _kahi_ ‘1’, as days 22–24. Presumably _kū-_ was once a term covering several days, in the same way as certain Maringe terms in [Table 11.26](#table-11.26) covered several days. Numbers were later added to enumerate the days within that phase. Days with their own names cluster around the full moon (as in [Table 11.25](#table-11.25)) and the new moon. The glosses appear to reflect a mixture of names of Hawaiian deities and names designating good (_kū-_ ‘stand’) and bad (_ʔole-kū-_ ‘not stand’) planting and fishing days.

In its full listing the most complex set of moon shape terms is from ’Are’are (SES), listed by Geerts under _hura_ ‘moon’, but the analysis in [Table 11.28](#table-11.28) shows that it is less complex than it looks. The days from 1 to 14, i.e. the days before the full moon, are labelled in pairs. Thus day 1 (new moon) is _tari-waro ara_, day 2 _tari-waro oreta_. Each pair is labelled with _ara_ ‘first’[^34] and _oreta_ ‘last’. Days 15 and 16, the latter the full moon, are _inoni ara_ and _inoni oreta_, after which days 17–30 repeat the pair labels of days 1–14 but in reverse order, so that day 17 is _hura-para ara_ and day 18 is _hura-para oreta_, and so on. The terms are at least partly metaphorical.

Other shape terms, for example, in Bariai (NNG), are simpler. ‘Moon’ is _taiko_.

Languages with shape terms rather than phase terms also have expressions meaning ‘the moon is waxing’ or ‘the moon is waning’, which, in combination with shape terms allow them to refer to a given moon phase.

### 6.5. Moon phases in Proto Oceanic?


What does the account in [§11](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11#cldf:6-11).[§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:6-11)–6.4 tell us about POc moon phase terms? As no terms can be reconstructed, it tells us nothing with certitude, but the following are reasonable inferences:

 1. There were terms for full moon ([§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:6-11)), for the nights of darkness and the newly
    appeared crescent moon ([§11.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-2#cldf:6-11)), and a little less certainly for the half moon ([§11.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-3#cldf:6-11)).
 2. The structure of the set of terms centred on the full moon, such that days around the full
    moon (and perhaps around the new moon) had dedicated labels, whereas other phases had
    labels that covered more than one day ([§11.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-1#cldf:6-11)).
 3. The names of the phases may have alluded to narratives or to shapes. Shape terms often
    depended on comparisons with common objects. Only one such comparison, of a crescent
    moon to a crescent-shaped piece of shell, occurs across subgroups (Bariai [NNG]
    _tue iragia_ ‘shard of mussel shell’, Motu [PT] _doɣaɣi_ ‘crescent shaped pearl-shell’, ’Are’are
    [SES] _roa_ ‘black lipped pearl shell used as scraper for coconut’). However, the possibility
    of the same comparison being made independently in different places is too high to allow
    a POc reconstruction.

## 7. Summing up


Apart from the Micronesian and Polynesian month terms reconstructed respectively in [§11.5.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-7#cldf:6-11) and [§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11), very few reconstructions of terms denoting seasonal cycles or lunar ‘months’ have resulted from the research reported in this chapter. However, our exploration of the data when seen in the light of various insightful quotes from ethnographers has resulted in a better understanding of the way in which POc speakers conceptualised time. Our conclusions may be summarised as follows.


<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. Proto Oceanic speakers saw time in terms of recurring cycles.


The times they used as reference points came from various cycles – plant cycles, weather cycles, wild life cycles – all subsumed under POc _&ast;taqun_ ‘any regular seasonal cycle’, and all moving within a grand unified scheme controlled by the sun. POc _&ast;taqun_ did not refer to a fixed period of time. It could be used to refer to the season appropriate to different contexts, perhaps most commonly the growing season of the yam ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:6-11)). If speakers wished to talk of the dry time or the time of voyaging they could refer more specifically to _&ast;raki_ ‘dry season when the southeast trades blow’, or if referring to the wet season or the period when bad weather affected their fishing, to _&ast;apaRat_ ‘wet season when northwesterlies blow and the sea is rough’ ([§11.4.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-7#cldf:6-11)). They recognised another cycle, the lunar cycle (POc _&ast;pulan_ ‘moon’), as one that moved to a different beat, independently of the others.


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. POc speakers had no concept of a year as a fixed period of time or unit of measurement.


A year was simply a cyclic entity ([§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:6-11)). If speakers conceived of a cycle encompassed by the sun’s annual path, they could refer to it either by _&ast;taqun_ or by any natural feature recurring in that cycle. As recurrent cycles they could be counted but not as fixed periods of time. Hence, people might talk about something happening three yam seasons ago or three wet seasons ago. Reflexes of _&ast;taqun_ have more recently been widely adopted to refer to the western concept of ‘year’.


<a id="s-7-3"></a>

### 7.3. Lunar months were useful for planning but named lunar months could not be added together to form a system.


If POc speakers had regular names for times of year, they did not form a fixed list. Lunar months, like seasons, are named by the events that define them. They are identified by their focus and not their length. It is impossible to say when one named period ends and another begins. Periods may blend into each other or overlap or leave gaps. Alternative names may be possible. Hence they cannot be added together to form a system. And because for POc speakers there was no concept of a year as a fixed period of time, there was no point in trying to combine them into a fixed list that could be aggregated to form a solar year. Instead, it was important that names be used flexibly so that adjustments could be made when necessary so that a month name matched its designated time of year. Where fixed lists exist, or have been reconstructed, they are usually seen as an attempt to integrate the western conception of time, and unless recognised as independent of the moon, must carry some way of intercalating the lunar and solar systems. The list reconstructed for PChk ignores lunar months, being based purely on star movements as they trace a solar year.


<a id="p-367"></a>

Although similar kinds of checkpoints identifying times in the annual cycle were recognised throughout the Oceanic world, few POc reconstructions have been possible. There are reconstructions only to PEOc (_&ast;(o,u)du_) and PCP (_&ast;balolo_) for the palolo worm as a specific marker of time. And although we have reconstructed a rather tentative POc _&ast;bulu(q)_ for the Pleiades, the constellation carries little weight in named lunar month terms. The inclusion of its name in a Micronesian list is purely as part of a star sequence while in Polynesia it serves either as the start an annual cycle or as a seasonal term.

### 7.4. Moons could be named as one-offs but not as part of a system.


For those communities where the palolo rising was celebrated, two successive moons might be named by the event. They might then form part of a regular seasonal pattern as in the Torres and Banks Islands ([Table 11.20](#table-11.20)). But the names, now referring to weather and plant cycles, could not continue to refer strictly to moons. Those who tried to connect regularly named times of year with the lunar cycle would quickly get out of sync. So if particular moons other than the palolo moons were named, they were moons identified by their relationship with some event in village life. Malinowski offers an explanation for naming particular moons. He writes that in the Trobriands:

> the whole scheme is not a division of the year into a number of moons, rather a method of calculating moons, especially full moons, standing for important tribal movements, which cover interesting and dramatic times of the year. And as the year—that period of garden cultivation and other important tribal events—interests them first with regard to gardens and supply of food, so moons which are relevant in these respects are named and known by name and are divided into a scheme of growth represented by plenty and scarcity. ([Malinowski 1927](Source#cldf:Malinowski1927):215)

For instance, he writes (1927:211), that _Milamala_ is the moon of festivities after the harvest, and that the names of _Milamala_, _Kuluwasasa_, the preceding month when harvesting is done, and _Yakosi_, the moon that follows _Milamala_ “are universally known to the natives and they are used by everybody” (p32). See also [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).1 ([Table 11.10](#table-11.10)) for three moons similarly marked in Wogeo. It seems that a community might name a small number of full moons that mark a special time in their cultural life. A situation when 12 or 13 are named would mean a fixed list with some way of adjusting to the solar year, an exercise for which there was no evidence in POc times.

### 7.5. The stars were the ultimate markers of time.



<a id="p-368"></a>

Stars could be relied on when careful planning was required ([§11.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-4-2#cldf:6-11)). Although there is considerable variation among communities today in their degree of familiarity with the stars, the Pleiades, POc _&ast;bulu(q)_, are widely recognised throughout the Oceanic world as significant markers of the annual cycle. Star knowledge may have been considered of greater importance before the introduction of the western calendar. Evidence ranges from almost total lack of interest among the Maenge ([Panoff 1969](Source#cldf:Panoff1969):156; cf [§11.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-1#cldf:6-11).2) to Muyuw’s recognition of thirteen stars or star groups as calendar stars ([Damon 1990](Source#cldf:Damon1990):37–40; cf [§11.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-2#cldf:6-11).1) and to the knowledge of the Micronesian ([§11.5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-6#cldf:6-11)) and Polynesian ([§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11)) navigators, for whom the night sky effectively served as both calendar and compass ([Lewis 1972](Source#cldf:Lewis1972)), ([vol.2, ch.6](ContributionTable#cldf:2-6)). It seems that although probably everyone in a community could identify a few stars or constellations, there were usually some people of authority, such as in the Trobriands, who were expected to have more detailed knowledge of the night sky. When more precise planning became necessary for trading voyages or ritual events, people would turn to experts in astronomical knowledge. [Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970):38) writes that in Woleai “seasonal time keeping [is] a responsibility of the chiefs, the Star of the Seasons (_füsalïrag_)”, while Gill writes that in Mangaia the responsibility for such planning lay with the king himself (1876:317).


## Notes

[^1]: ` For the palolo worm and its rising, see [§11.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2#cldf:6-11) and [§11.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2-1#cldf:6-11).

[^2]:  Bwaidoga _avalata_ reflects POc _&ast;apaRat_ ‘north-west monsoon season’ ([vol.2:128](ContributionTable?anchor=p-128#cldf:2-5)–130, 307). See [§11.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-2-1#cldf:6-11).

[^3]: This set reflects POc _&ast;pali(s,j)i_ ‘generic term for grasses and other grass-like plants’ ([vol.3:75](ContributionTable?anchor=p-75#cldf:3-3)), but this meaning is retained only in ’Are’are and Ulawa. The shift in semantic focus to ‘yam harvest’ must already have occurred in Proto Malaita–Makira.

[^4]: For Bugotu the sense ‘year’ is given only in the English–Bugotu finderlist of [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1940) ([1940](Source#cldf:Ivens1940)).

[^5]: Supporting cognate sets are given in [vol.2:131](ContributionTable?anchor=p-131#cldf:2-5)–135.

[^6]: Kiribati lies north of the Equator, so the dates given in [Table 11.1](#table-11.1) do not apply.

[^7]: These astronomical risings and settings are respectively the heliacal (or cosmical) rising, the acronychal (or acronitic) rising, the cosmical setting and the heliacal setting (or acronychal/acronitic) setting). Heliacal means ‘coincident with the sun’ (rising when the sun rises, setting when the sun sets), while acronychal means ‘occurring at sunset’.

[^8]:  For example, when Ross attempted to elicit Takia (NNG) star names in the 1980s, the only feature whose name was well known was the Pleiades.

[^9]:  [Nilsson](Source#cldf:Nilsson1920) ([1920](Source#cldf:Nilsson1920):114–122) notes that Mohammed swears by the setting Pleiades in the 53rd chapter of the Koran. Homer refers to them in the Iliad, and they are known to the Eskimos of Greenland and the Luiseño of southern California. According to Strehlow, in central Australia the Pleiades are seven maidens who had danced at the circumcision ceremony and then ascended into the heavens.

[^10]: This apparent lag in star movements is influenced by what is known as the precession of the equinoxes, caused by a slight wobble in the earth’s axis.

[^11]: The dates here and below were estimated using the software application Stellarium (http://www.stellarium.org/), which allows one to see the sky from a given location at any point in time. The web page Sirius and its phenomena in the course of the year (http://www.gautschy.ch/~rita/archast/sirius/siriuseng.htm#jahreslauf, accessed on 30 April 2016, based on [Gautschy](Source#cldf:Gautschy2011) ([2011](Source#cldf:Gautschy2011)), provided a model for working out the Pleiades’ dates.

[^12]: It is possible that this is also true of the WOc language Barok, discussed in [§11.5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-3#cldf:6-11).2.

[^13]: Kairiru _munuan_ is inferred to have meant ‘palolo’ because of its evident cognacy with Wogeo _manuan_. It is not glossed by [Wivell](Source#cldf:Wivell1981b) ([1981b](Source#cldf:Wivell1981b)).

[^14]: Proto Banks–Torres month terms are listed and reconstructed in [§11.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-5#cldf:6-11), [Table 11.20](#table-11.20).

[^15]: A set of Proto Nuclear Polynesian month names is reconstructed in [§11.5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-8#cldf:6-11).2.

[^16]: ‘_Canarium_ almond’ is technically more appropriate, as the canarium ‘nut’ is botanically not a nut but a drupe, like the almond. A drupe is a seed contained in a hard covering that makes up the ‘stone’ of a stone fruit like the peach ([vol.3:312](ContributionTable?anchor=p-312#cldf:3-11)).

[^17]: We have found no instances in Vanuatu, but our collection of Vanuatu calendars is not well distributed and in some instances not well understood (see [§11.5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-5-5#cldf:6-11)).

[^18]: Panoff's notes are lightly abbreviated. He glosses _ulasi_ as ‘small unidentified fish’, but [Madden’s](Source#cldf:Madden2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Madden2002)) more precise gloss is used in [Table 11.11](#table-11.11).

[^19]: Malinowski in fact reported this in his first major Trobriand publication in 1916, but later either forgot or dismissed it. He wrote in 1916 in describing the _milamala_ festival, "[The festival] is held always at the same time of the year, in the first half of the moon, which is also called milamala. This moon is determined—as their calendar in general—by the position of the stars. And in Kiriwina proper, the full moon of _milamala_ falls in the second half of August or first half of September." And later he adds, "The dates of the moons are fixed by the position of the stars, in which astronomical art the natives of Wawela, a village lying on the beach in the southern half of the island, excel." (Malinowski 1954 [1916]: 179. 262).

[^20]: In order, starting mid-March, the list runs _kib_ (Delphinus), _kiyad_ (Orion's Belt), _gumeaw_ (Pleiades), _kowun_, _nowagteit_ and _lakum_ (Praesipie) all rising pre-dawn, followed from mid-September, by _tanaboub_ (Southern Cross), _tabwakum_ (Coalsacks), _dagelio_/_sinat_ (Scorpius), _alisig_, _kup_, _kuluwit_ (Big Dipper) and _usay_.

[^21]: The two transit dates would more accurately be 26 February and 6 August. The first date does not strictly fit into _marana-kai_ and seems to belong in the next lunation, but Wagner attributes minor discrepancies to the approximateness of the whole Barok calendar.

[^22]: In 1918 (under _wārowāro_ ‘moon') Ivens wrote "the names of the months in Sa'a begin from July, the harvest month.".

[^23]: Our thanks to Alexandre François for orthographic assistance and rich ethnographic notes for Torres-Banks languages. He reports that his elderly Mwesen consultants did not know the old terms for other months, but they provided ample ethnographic information for those they could remember.

[^24]: Since Mota, Mwotlap and Mwesen are closely related and Loh is clearly more distant from them than they are to each other, one criterion for a reconstruction is that it be reflected in Loh and one of the other three languages. Two reconstructions are only partially cognate, one because the Loh term reflects the descriptor ‘bitter' of the other two but not the topic, the other where ‘fresh' and ‘wet' are taken as equivalent descriptions of the new grass.

[^25]: It is of passing interest that while Seeman and Hocart both identify December/January with _nuga_, the rabbitfish, which appear then in greater numbers, Pawley and Sayaba identify them with _nuga_, a tree, Decaspermum vitiense, which bears fruit at this time.

[^26]: Timing is also influenced by the precession of the equinoxes. If we date the breakup of Proto Micronesian as at least two thousand years ago, this progression of stars would have occurred three or four weeks earlier than today.

[^27]: _&ast;manuk_ is one of the few constellation names reconstructed for POc, with reflexes from the Admiralties, Micronesia and two Polynesian outliers. Ross (1996) conjectures that because Admiralty Islanders almost certainly had contact with Micronesian speakers in pre-modern times, it is possible that Seimat (Ninigo) _mān_ in the sense given here was borrowed from a Micronesian language.

[^28]: The palolo rising occurs in the Tuamotus but there it is referred to as _koiri-taki-veve_.

[^29]: “Approximate” because the lunar cycle lasts 29.53 days.

[^30]: No Atchin term has been found for full moon. This is perhaps an omission from [Capell & Layard](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980) ([1980](Source#cldf:CapellandLayard1980)).

[^31]: The Motu terms are exceptional in labelling periods between the full moon and the third quarter. A few Oceanic languages have a name for every day of the month: see [§11.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-6-4#cldf:6-11).

[^32]: In the 1980s Ross observed nightlong Takia full moon celebrations.

[^33]: Glosses of the Hawaiian terms are based on on [Pukui & Elbert](Source#cldf:PukuiElbert1971) ([1971](Source#cldf:PukuiElbert1971)) and on those at http//:www.instanthawaii.com/cgi-bin/hi?Weather.moon (accessed 25 February 2022).

[^34]: [Geerts](Source#cldf:Geerts1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Geerts1970)) has no gloss for _ara_ in this context.

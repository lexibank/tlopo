## 0. Introduction


The most widespread form of measurement in traditional Oceanic societies was linear, used in house and canoe construction and for measuring lengths of strung shell used as currency. [Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970)) provides perhaps the best account of measurement in an Oceanic society, namely Woleai in Micronesia. His description is detailed, discussing what measurement is used for and how it is applied.

In the formal distribution of wealth and in trade, foodstuffs and other valued items were measured by counting. Counting included the use of conventionally accepted measures such as baskets or bunches. Matters relating to counting and its linguistic consequences are treated in some detail in chapter 14.

POc speakers almost certainly had a verb for measuring the depth of seawater, and at least one for measuring the volume, particularly of food, but no reconstructions can be made. There was no regular means of measuring weights.

## 1. Units of linear measurement


The units of linear measurement that Alkire lists for Woleaian (Mic) are listed in (1). The items in Alkire’s list have been checked against [Sohn & Tawerilmang](Source#cldf:SohnandTawerilmang1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:SohnandTawerilmang1976)) and the list of measurement classifiers in [Sohn](Source#cldf:Sohn1975) ([1975](Source#cldf:Sohn1975):61), and Alkire’s forms have been replaced by Sohn’s and re-spelled in accordance with the orthographic convention used in these volumes ([§1.4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-4-2#cldf:6-16)).

<a id="p-550"></a>

This list perhaps gives some idea of traditional units of linear measurement in Oceanic societies, which in many places have vanished for ever. However, before we turn to issues associated with reconstructing lexical items, it is necessary to look briefly at the morphosyntax of such items, as it bears on their reconstruction.


<a id="s-2"></a>

## 2. The morphosyntax of units of linear measurement


Some of the terms listed in (1) are preceded by a hyphen, others not. Those with no hyphen are nouns. Those with a hyphen are numeral classifiers, described at some length in [§14.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-7#cldf:6-16). For convenience’s sake a short summary is given here.

A numeral classifier is a word that occurs with a numeral but has some semantic relationship to the entity that is being counted. Six types of numeral classifier are distinguished in [§14.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-1-1#cldf:6-16), but only three types, multiplicative, mensural and unit-of-measurement concern us here. Mensural classifiers—or something performing the same semantic functions—occur in all languages., as in English _ten_ ___grains___ _of sand_, _two_ ___pinches___ _of salt_, _a_ ___bottle___ _of beer_ and so on. The classifier (in bold) provides a unit that is or can be counted with a numeral. This unit is one that is conventionally associated with what is counted: sand comes in grains, salt is quantified (in more traditional western recipes) in pinches, and so on.

In Oceanic languages that have numeral classifiers the numeral and the classifier are usually combined to form a word. The PMP order within these words was &ast;numeral- [_ŋa-_]classifier. POc retained this order with some classifiers, for example the multiplicative classifiers _&ast;-Ratus_ ‘unit of a hundred’ and _&ast;-puluq_ ‘unit of ten’ in POc _&ast;sa-ŋa-Ratus_ ‘one hundred’ or _&ast;tolu-ŋa-puluq_ ‘thirty (= three tens)’. But POc also used the &ast;classifier numeral order with other classifiers. Each language that retains classifiers uses one or the other ordering, except for some Polynesian languages, which have both structures. Micronesian languages reflect the &ast;numeral-[_ŋa-_]classifier, usually without _&ast;-ŋa-_ and exemplified by (2), with the mensural classifier _-xumʷ_ ‘mouthful’.


<a id="p-551"></a>

[6-16-2-None-551-49](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-16-2-None-551-49)

The multiplicative classifier _-ix_ ‘ten’ behaves in the same way as POc _&ast;-Ratus_ and _&ast;puluq_ above.

[6-16-2-None-551-50](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-16-2-None-551-50)

Finally, a unit-of-measurement classifier specifies a measurement, and together with the numeral gives the size of the following item.

[6-16-2-None-551-51](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-16-2-None-551-51)

This, then, is the structural context of the items in (1) that begin with a hyphen.

## 3. Melanesian shell money


Many of the measurement terms discussed in this chapter have their origin in the measurement of Melanesian shell money. These ‘currencies’ are found in a more or less continuous region that stretches from the Admiralties via New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville and the NW and SE Solomons to the Banks and Torres Islands of Vanuatu.[^1] In smaller units they appear to have been used for everyday transactions at some locations, e.g. among the Tolai of NE New Britain. Perhaps wherever they were used, large quantities were accrued by individuals and were used in a variety of ceremonies, including bride wealth payments, land rights payments, mortuary exchanges, initiation presentations ([Hogbin 1964a](Source#cldf:Hogbin1964a); [Epstein 1969](Source#cldf:Epstein1969):ch.7; [Counts & Counts 1970](Source#cldf:CountsandCounts1970); [Simet 1991](Source#cldf:Simet1991); see [§13.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-13-5#cldf:6-16)). The literature on the cultural roles of shell money is substantial and often engages in controversy, and we lack the relevant expertise to discuss it here.[^2]

In parts of the NW Solomons, shell money consists of rings or drums made from the shell of the giant clam (genus _Tridacna_; [vol.4:189](ContributionTable?anchor=p-189#cldf:4-4)–190). Elsewhere in the region it consists of disks manufactured from various shell species, each disk about a centimetre in diameter with a hole in the centre. The disks are threaded onto strong, fine string, packed together so that, where disks made of shells of different colours alternate, they form a colourful pattern. A number of different shellfish species supply the shells. A major shell-money production centre in Malaita is at Langalanga Lagoon, where inhabitants of the artificial islets built from coral make their living by manufacturing shell money. Four shell species are used: omu ‘red- lipped oyster, Chana pacifica’; kakadu ‘ridged white cockleshell, Anadara granosa’; kurila ‘black mussel, Atrina vexillum’; and ke’e ‘half-round cardita, Beguina semiorbiculata)’ ([Goto 1996](Source#cldf:Goto1996)). In other locations nassa shells (dog whelks), cowries, cone shells or Spondylus shells are used.


<a id="p-552"></a>

The strings of shell money circulate in varying lengths, and the main use of a number of the unit-of-measurement terms discussed below is to denote these lengths, ranging from a length of two finger segments up to many fathoms. A fathom is the measurement from the fingertips of one hand to the fingertips of the other when both arms are stretched our sideways. [Counts & Counts](Source#cldf:CountsandCounts1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:CountsandCounts1970):100) list the terms traditionally used by the Lusi (NNG) speakers of NW New Britain for various lengths of vula ‘shell money’, along with their 1970 Australian dollar valuations, which serve to indicate relative values.

## 4. Reconstructing linear measurement terms


The list in (1) is a decidedly conservative set of traditional measurement units—conservative in two respects. First, even for other Micronesian languages, comparable lists are hardly to be found. [Jackson & Marck](Source#cldf:JacksonandMarck1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:JacksonandMarck1991):328) come closest, recording Carolinian units corresponding to ten of Alkire’s. [Capell](Source#cldf:Capell1969) ([1969](Source#cldf:Capell1969):67–68) and [Sohn & Bender](Source#cldf:SohnandBender1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:SohnandBender1983):202–203) record five each for Sonsorol and Ulithian respectively. Other Micronesian languages appear to retain only a term for fathom. The second aspect of conservatism is that Woleaian retains unit-of-measurement classifiers, which elsewhere are being lost in favour of nouns. Thus in Puluwatese [Elbert](Source#cldf:Elbert1974) ([1974](Source#cldf:Elbert1974):112) notes that (7a), where ‘fathom’ is a classifier, is being replaced by (7b), where it is a noun.

[6-16-4-None-553-52](examplegroups.csv#cldf:6-16-4-None-553-52)

The only unit of measurement recorded for Mokilese/Ponapean is the noun _ŋap_/_ŋāp_ ‘fathom’ ([Harrison & Albert 1977](Source#cldf:Harrisonandalbert1977); [Rehg 1981](Source#cldf:Rehg1981)). No traditional units of measurement are recorded for Marshallese (Abo et al 1976) or Kosraean ([Lee 1975](Source#cldf:Lee1975)). This patchiness in recording is also found across the SE Solomons, where measurement terms were used at least until recently to measure lengths of shell money. Indeed, some definitions given in dictionaries of SE Solomonic languages ([Ivens 1918](Source#cldf:Ivens1918); [Fox 1955](Source#cldf:Fox1955)) and elsewhere are explicit that some of these terms, particularly those involving more complicated paths across the human body, were used to measure strings of shell money. For example:

[6-16-4-None-553-nng-kove-walaravarexe](cf.csv#cldf:6-16-4-None-553-nng-kove-walaravarexe)

The absence of records of these terminologies from dictionaries of SE Solomonic and Micronesian languages has two possible causes. The first is that the terms had died out before the dictionary data were recorded, perhaps because shell money usage has diminished. The second is that the dictionary-maker was only interested in recording the modern language, and omitted more traditional or more archaic terms.


<a id="p-554"></a>

In the Ulawa term _ida ʔapala_ above, _ʔapala_ means ‘shoulder’, but no separate item _ida_ is recorded by Ivens. This is, we assume, an idiomatic phrase, the full original meaning of which is now lost. This seems to be true of a number of the terms cited below.

Our goal here is not just to reconstruct POc terms (or terms in a later interstage language) but to ascertain how far back the unit-of-measurement concept can be traced. If we can show that a certain meaning is expressed in daughters of a particular protolanguage (often phrasally), then, even if the terms are not cognate, we can be reasonably certain that the concept was expressed by a dedicated term in the relevant protolanguage.

All the terms reconstructed below have their basis in the fingers, hands and arms of the human body. This is unsurprising, as traditional units of measurement the world over have been based on the human body. The _cubit_ (elbow to fingertip; [§16.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6-4#cldf:6-16)) was an important measure used around the Mediterranean. Mongolian had the _ald_, Ancient Greek the _orgyiá_, Old English the _fæðm_, all denoting a pair of embracing or outstretched arms and corresponding to the Oceanic fathom. The pre-metrication English system had the _inch_, based on the width of a person’s thumb, and the _foot_. The length of the foot is recorded as a unit of measurement in a few Oceanic sources, but no dedicated term is reconstructable.

There is a further division to be made among these body-based terms. The few reconstructable measure concepts other than the span were involved in measuring strings of shell money. The (flexible) object to be measured—the shell money—was strung across the measuring instrument, the human body. The span, however, was used in the converse manner: instead of taking the object to the instrument, one took the instrument—the hand—like a tape measure to the (typically rigid) object to be measured. [Alkire](Source#cldf:Alkire1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Alkire1970):33) shows that the span was used in canoe building. There is no evidence that it was used to measure money strings.

Section 16.5 is thus devoted to the measurement of rigid objects, [§16.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6#cldf:6-16) to measurements employed for flexible objects. Section 16.6.1 takes the fathom as its starting point, followed by the half-fathom in [§16.6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6-2#cldf:6-16) and measures between the half-fathom and the fathom in [§16.6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6-3#cldf:6-16). With the cubit ([§16.6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6-4#cldf:6-16)) we move to measures less than half a fathom. Section 16.6.5 looks briefly at the scrappy evidence for units longer than the fathom. Section 16.7 is devoted to verbs of measuring, and [§16.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-8#cldf:6-16) draws some rather restricted conclusions.

One might expect a chapter entitled ‘Measurement’ to deal with terms for ‘length’ and ‘breadth’. If we exclude the use of length in a length of X, then Oceanic languages tend not to have dedicated terms for ‘length’ and ‘breadth’. Instead they either use the terms for ‘long’ (especially reflexes of POc _&ast;[ma]lawa_ ‘long, tall’; [vol.2:198](ContributionTable?anchor=p-198#cldf:2-7)) or ‘broad’ as nouns, occasionally with nominalising morphology, or as adjectives as in It is 3 metres long.

## 5. Measuring rigid objects



<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. The span


The most widely reflected term for a hand-based measurement is POc _&ast;saŋa_, which Blust (ACD) glosses ‘crotch, fork of the legs; span, fork of the fingers’. This gloss captures the fact that the POc meaning of this term was less specific than it is in a number of daughter-languages. Further, according to the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995), POc _&ast;saŋa_ had two PMP ancestors, _&ast;saŋa_ ‘bifurcation’ and _&ast;zaŋan_ ‘handspan’, which merged in PEMP and POc as _&ast;saŋa_. To judge from its Oceanic reflexes, it retained this range of meaning, and also had the senses of a forked stick or branch ([vol.3:96](ContributionTable?anchor=p-96#cldf:3-4)) and the crotch (the bifurcation of the legs; [vol.5:173](ContributionTable?anchor=p-173#cldf:5-3)). This breadth of meaning has ensured the word’s retention in numerous languages, along with the probable fact that the hand span was a commonly used means of everyday measurement. There is some evidence that it may also have denoted spans other than those formed with the hand. Its Mangseng reflex means ‘fathom’; in Tuamotuan ‘measure across chest to fingertips’. Even at the level of hand-span, reflexes vary as to whether the involved finger was the forefinger, the middle finger or the little finger (and many definitions do not specify which). It seems possible from the glosses below that in Proto Nuclear Polynesian this was the little finger.


<a id="p-555"></a>

[Jackson](Source#cldf:Jackson1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Jackson1983):77) notes that the loss of _&ast;s-_ in the Chuukese reflexes of _&ast;saŋa_, all of them numeral classifiers prefixed by a numeral, is an irregular innovation that along with others defines the Chuukese subgroup. Non-Chuukese Micronesian languages have lost the term.

The non-cognate items listed below as ‘other terms for the span’ indicate that the concept and use of the hand span as a measure was clearly present in Oceanic regions where a reflex of _&ast;saŋa_ was not used to denote it. However, it is perhaps significant that no reflexes of _&ast;saŋa_ are found in mainland New Guinea or in Admiralties, N-C Vanuatu or New Caledonian languages. In the latter cases, this may reflect insufficient data sources; in the case of New Guinea it may reflect contact with Papuan systems of measurement, but this is a matter for further research.

[PMP &ast;_saŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-5-1-555-POc-saa-a)


<a id="p-556"></a>

Other terms for the span include:

[6-16-5-1-556-nng-bariai-leoa](cf.csv#cldf:6-16-5-1-556-nng-bariai-leoa)


<a id="p-557"></a>


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Fingers


There are thinly scattered terms for the lengths of one finger segment and two finger segments in SE Solomonic and Micronesian languages. The fact that there is a (non-Oceanic) Kéo term for a finger segment suggests that a term may have been present in POc, but there is no evidence for a reconstruction.

[Kéo &ast;_fatə_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-5-2-557-PChk-makotociki-a)

The evidence for a measurement term meaning two finger segments is weaker and in any case does not go back beyond PEOc.

[’Are’are &ast;_ato-ato_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-5-2-557-PChk-makotolapa-a)

A PChk term for ‘length of a finger’ is reconstructable, and the non-cognate terms listed below suggest that a finger length has been used as a unit of measure at least from PEOc times and perhaps earlier.

[POc &ast;_tusu-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-5-2-557-POc-tusu-a)

Other terms for ‘finger length’ are:

[6-16-5-2-557-ses-bugotu-posileo](cf.csv#cldf:6-16-5-2-557-ses-bugotu-posileo)


<a id="p-558"></a>


<a id="s-5-3"></a>

### 5.3. Hand-related units larger than a finger


Just a few terms meaning ‘width of the palm’ have been found: Kéo (CMP) _pəʔba_ ‘width across widest part of hand at base of the thumb’; Kwaio (SES) _fadaleʔenima_ ‘width of palm and four fingers’; Sa’a _kʷaŋo i saʔo_ ‘a measure, a hand’s breadth’; and Woleaian (Mic) _-peṣa-nim_ ‘width of the palm’ (lit. ‘handle of hand’). It isn’t clear, however, that these refer to the same dimension, and they may reflect independent innovations.

Some Eastern Oceanic languages have a term for a unit of measure from the wrist to the fingertips, and such a unit was perhaps present in PEOc, but no term is reconstructable.

<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Measuring flexible objects


As was noted earlier, the main flexible object measured in Oceanic communities was probably a string of shell money ([§16.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-3#cldf:6-16)). We start with the most widely attested unit, the fathom, then move to various part-fathom measures, then finally to measures longer than the fathom. Looking at the Tolai terms in (6), it is possible that there were more early Oceanic terms for lengths greater than the fathom, but these are lost to us.

### 6.1. The fathom


When both arms are stretched out sideways, the fathom is the measurement from the fingertips of one hand to the fingertips of the other. In English this has become principally a nautical term (1.8288 metres = 6 feet), but in Oceanic languages the measurement was applied in many locations to a length of shell money. It was and remains the basic unit in measuring shell money, where this still exists, but it had other functions, otherwise it would not be reported from so many languages whose speakers do not have or no longer have the shell money tradition.

POc appears to have had two terms for fathom, but they had different grammatical functions. POc _&ast;ropa_ was a noun, and POc _&ast;-ŋapa_ a numeral classifier.

<a id="p-559"></a>

The numeral classifier _&ast;-ŋapa_ continues to be reflected as a classifier in Admiralties and some Micronesian languages. In other languages it has been reanalysed as a noun. It reflects the PMP classifier construction &ast;numeral-[_ŋa-_]classifier, mentioned in [§16.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-2#cldf:6-16) and discussed in more detail in [§14.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-14-3#cldf:6-16). Blust (ACD) does not reconstruct _&ast;-ŋapa_ to a stage earlier than POc, and we have found no non-Oceanic cognates. Nonetheless, from its form it seems probable that it occurred in the environment of, e.g. †_&ast;sa-ŋa-ropa_ ‘one fathom’, †_&ast;rua-ŋa-ropa_ ‘two fathoms’, and so on. However, rather than †_&ast;-ŋa-ropa_ the data require reconstruction of the abbreviated form _&ast;-ŋa-pa_. Section 14.4.5.2 shows that, for example, _&ast;sa-ŋa-puluq_ ‘(one) ten’ was reanalysed as _&ast;sa-ŋapuluq_ in very early Oceanic. An analogous change evidently reanalysed †_&ast;sa-ŋa-ropa_ as _&ast;sa-ŋa(ro)pa_, resulting in forms such as in (8).

Many of the reflexes below reflect a reanalysis of the classifier as a noun.

Listed below are terms for ‘fathom’ in languages that lack a reflex of _&ast;ropa_ or _&ast;-ŋapa_. The Drehu and Nengone terms below may reflect POc _&ast;-ŋapa_, but our knowledge of the sound correspondences of these languages is insufficient to be certain.

### 6.2. The half-fathom


The terms listed below all denote a measurement from the centre of the sternum (breastbone) to the fingertips of one outstretched arm, i.e. half a fathom.

The only term that can be reconstructed for a half-fathom is PChk _&ast;dila-wupʷa_, literally ‘breast split’. Beneath its reflexes are listed terms for half-fathom for a wide range of Oceanic languages. They indicate that the concept was present in POc but was probably expressed by a phrasal idiom. A couple of the terms listed below appear to mean something similar to ‘breast split’: see the glosses of the Banoni and Babatana terms. Within this list are two obvious cognate pairs: Longgu and Arosi, Wayan and Boumaa Fijian. Beyond these, there are no cognate items.

Some glosses mention ‘yard’. In pre-metric Imperial measure a yard is exactly half a fathom, i.e. 0.9144 metres).

Other terms for the half-fathom include:

### 6.3. Between fathom and half-fathom


No reconstruction is possible for any measurement term between a fathom and half a fathom. The variation among the glosses of these in-between terms prevents us from inferring what measurements POc speaks might have used..

The most widespread of these measures is a length from the fingertips of one hand of an extended arm to the opposite shoulder. The lowest three items below reflect POc _&ast;qapaRa_ ‘shoulder’ ([vol.5:142](ContributionTable?anchor=p-142#cldf:5-3)).

[6-16-6-3-563-nng-kove-walaravarexe](cf.csv#cldf:6-16-6-3-563-nng-kove-walaravarexe)

A slightly longer measure was the length from the fingertips of one hand to the opposite elbow. The root of the Arosi and Owa items appears to reflect POc _&ast;bakewa_ ‘shark’ ([vol.4:30](ContributionTable?anchor=p-30#cldf:4-2)), but, if it does, the association is not clear. [Mellow](Source#cldf:Mellow2014) ([2014](Source#cldf:Mellow2014)) writes somewhat mysteriously that ‘this measurement looks like a shark’. It is tempting to reconstruct PNPn _&ast;fati-uku_ (PPn _&ast;fati_ ‘angle, bend’; PPn _&ast;qutu(a)_ ‘promontory’) here, but POLLEX questions this, presumably because of the distribution of the Polynesian reflexes below, which embraces no Polynesian subgroup.

<a id="p-564"></a>

Similar terms, presumably arising from the need for graduated and acceptably precise measurement of shell-money strings, include the following: from fingertips to the opposite armpit/biceps/ear or to the throat. Whether any of these concepts existed in POc one cannot tell.

### 6.4. The cubit


The unit denoted by the archaic English word cubit is recorded across much of Oceanic. It refers to the length of the forearm, from the elbow to the fingertips. Although the cubit in Mediterranean society was a measure of both rigid and flexible objects, its application in Oceanic communities was to flexible things like strings of shell money. A PMic form (a numeral classifier) can be reconstructed. The non-cognate data below serve to indicate that this was probably a POc concept, but one that was probably expressed by a phrase containing the term for ‘arm’ or ‘elbow’.

[PMic &ast;_-mʷanū_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-6-4-564-PMic-manu-a)


<a id="p-565"></a>

Other terms for the cubit are found quite widely:

[6-16-6-4-565-nng-mangap-yok](cf.csv#cldf:6-16-6-4-565-nng-mangap-yok)

A few Oceanic languages have a term for the length of the arm as a measure, each involving a term for ‘arm’, but it is possible that these are parallel developments.


<a id="s-6-5"></a>

### 6.5. Longer than the fathom


The lists in (6) show that Tolai (MM) had terms for units of shell money longer than the fathom. Arosi (SES) had terms for larger units still: _tahaŋa_ ‘4 fathoms of shell money’; _gagau_ ‘25 fathoms of shell money’; _ita_ ‘40 fathoms of shell money’. Arosi _ʔauhoa_ is ‘a measure, about a furlong’ ([Fox 1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)).’ Owa (SES) _wairina_ is ‘ten fathoms’. However, the evidence for such terms is very fragmentary indeed.

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Clark1999)) reconstructs Proto Polynesian _&ast;(ŋa)kumi_ ‘ten fathoms’.

## 7. Verbs of measuring


The POc verb for measuring out a length, for example, of wood and marking it accordingly was _&ast;topoŋ_. Final _&ast;-ŋ_ is reflected before a suffix in Mussau and Numbami. It is thus a regular continuation of PAn _&ast;tepeŋ_ ‘to measure quantities, as amounts of grain’, but appears to have undergone a change in meaning, as only one of the Oceanic reflexes listed below, namely Longgu (SES), refers to measuring volume rather then length. Wherever the glosses of other items are specific about what is being measured, it is the length of a rigid object. Given the distinction made earlier between measuring rigid objects ([§16.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-5#cldf:6-16)) and measuring flexible objects ([§16.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6#cldf:6-16)), one might also expect a verb for measuring flexible objects. POc _&ast;ropa_ ‘fathom’ also served this purpose, as the meaning ‘measure in fathoms’ is reconstructable from its reflexes ([§16.6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-16-6-1#cldf:6-16)). The same meaning appears to be reconstructable for _&ast;-ŋapa_, but as it was a POc classifier, and thus a bound morpheme, it seems unlikely that it was also used as a POc verb, and probable that reflexes with the meaning ‘measure in fathoms’ are later developments.

[PAn &ast;_tepeŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-16-7-None-566-POc-topo-a)


<a id="p-567"></a>

POc _&ast;topoŋ_ was evidently lost in PPn, and was replaced by PPn _&ast;fua_. There are possible cognates in some Western Oceanic languages.

## 8. Conclusions


The data considered in this chapter suggest strongly that there was a distinction in POc between measuring rigid objects and measuring flexible things such as shell money. This is borne out both in the units of measurement and in the verbs of measuring that can be reconstructed. The material also indicates that the lexicon for measuring flexible things was more complex than that for measuring rigid objects. The complexity of measurement units for flexible items was evidently driven by the need to accurately measure pieces of shell money.


<a id="p-568"></a>

Units of measurement applied to shell money and other items centred on the fathom, which with its definition as the distance between the fingertips of two outstretched arms, served as a baseline for the creation of other terms. It is significant that two POc terms for the fathom are readily reconstructable—_&ast;ropa_ and _&ast;-ŋapa_—but that POc terms for the half-fathom and units between the half-fathom and the fathom are not. The fact that a number of Oceanic languages agree on expressing these meanings implies that the concepts existed in POc, but the fact that no POc lexical items for them are reconstructable suggests that they were perhaps referred to by phrasal idioms that have been continually replaced. Among shorter units of measurement, terms for the cubit are found across Oceania, and there was presumably a POc term for it, but the evidence does not permit a reconstruction.

The two POc reconstructions for ‘fathom’, _&ast;ropa_ and _&ast;-ŋapa_, are respectively a noun and a classifier. Classifiers are discussed at some length in chapter 14.

The medial _-a-_ of Seimat _kaha-_ is an unexplained development that is also reflected in the Levei-Drehet cognate _a-lap_. It is possible that it reflects analogy with _&ast;-ŋapa_ ‘fathom’.

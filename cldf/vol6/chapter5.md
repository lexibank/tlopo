## 1. Introduction


This chapter asks what linguistic evidence can tell us about Proto Oceanic speakers’ settlement patterns and relation to territory, both land and sea.[^1] Where were settlements located? What sort of residential communities existed? Did people live in sizeable villages or in dispersed hamlets? What sort of buildings were constructed, in terms of function and architecture? What sort of territorial units were recognised?

A conjunction of archaeological and linguistic evidence places the primary dispersal centre of Proto Oceanic in the Bismarck Archipelago and associates this language with the archaeological tradition known as (Early Western) Lapita, whose bearers spread very swiftly across the southwest Pacific around 3000 BP, reaching Tonga by 2850 BP. Archaeology tells us a good deal about the preferred habitation sites of early Lapita settlements in the Bismarck Archipelago ([Green 2003](Source#cldf:Green2003); [Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997), [2000](Source#cldf:Kirch2000); [Spriggs 1997a](Source#cldf:Spriggs1997a); [Summerhayes 2010](Source#cldf:Summerhayes2010)). All the sites are on the coast, close to beaches and fringing reefs that, respectively, would have provided landing places for canoes and for obtaining seafood. However, archaeology has yielded little evidence about the internal organisation of Lapita dwelling sites, as very few have been excavated extensively enough to reveal the arrangement of houses and other structures and areas of use.

Ethnographic evidence on settlement patterns and use of territory in Oceanic speaking communities is rich (comparative studies include [Forge 1972](Source#cldf:Forge1972), [Hogbin and Wedgwood 1953](Source#cldf:HogbinandWedgwood1953), [Oliver 1989](Source#cldf:Oliver1989)). Patterns that recur in the ethnographic accounts include the following:


<a id="p-176"></a>

1) Consistent with the record for Lapita sites, there is a strong preference for settlements on
   the coast, near beaches, fringing reefs and lagoons and close to land suitable for
   gardening.
2) Both nucleated and dispersed settlements are common. Nucleated settlements, villages
   of up to several hundred people, are invariably found when land is in short supply.
   Dispersed settlements, consisting of scattered hamlets, are most common where land is
   plentiful. Where attacks are feared settlements may be situated in inaccessible places
   with defences constructed.
3) In villages where the terrain allows, main dwellings are usually arranged in parallel
   lines on each side of a rectangular space that serves as a ceremonial centre.
4) Villages divide into sections, each section containing households belonging to a single
   lineage or part of a lineage.
5) Each lineage owns certain house sites. These sites have ritual importance.
6) Each family has a main dwelling house. In western Melanesia this is generally
   rectangular and raised on piles. In most other regions of Oceania houses are usually
   built on the ground or on a flat mound of earth or coral rubble and come in rectangular,
   round or oval forms.
7) Main dwelling houses have a two-section thatched roof with high gable.
8) There is a porch in the front of raised houses.
9) The interior of the main dwelling is divided into a sleeping compartment and a living
   room.
10) Most daily activities, e.g. food preparation, cooking, eating, weaving mats,
    conversation with neighbours, take place in smaller structures erected near the main
    dwelling. These structures are open-sided or only partly-walled, often with flat roofs of
    coconut leaves or rough thatching.
11) Coastal settlements have open-sided boat houses, each usually belonging to an
    extended family.
12) In yam-growing areas there are storage houses with raised platforms for keeping yams.
13) In parts of Melanesia a men’s house is commonly part of the hamlet or village, serving
    as a centre where men and boys may gather and perform certain rituals.
14) Graves, often marked by piles of stones may be sited under or close to the main
    dwelling.

However, as ethnographic comparisons refer only to recent times they can do no more than suggest hypotheses about the situation in POc times, some three millennia ago. We turn to lexical reconstructions as a source of evidence.

## 2. Proto Oceanic speakers were fishermen-farmers


POc speakers were a maritime people, for whom the sea was an important economic resource. They had an extensive vocabulary for fishing methods and technology ([vol.1, ch.8](ContributionTable#cldf:1-8)) and for outrigger canoe parts and sea travel ([vol.1, ch.7](ContributionTable#cldf:1-7)). More than 140 POc names for marine fish taxa and more than 40 names for marine invertebrates have been reconstructed (vol.4, chs 2 and 4). Relevant terms for the seascape and landscape ([vol. 2, ch.4](ContributionTable#cldf:2-4)) include _&ast;tasik_ ‘sea’, _&ast;masawa(n,ŋ)_ ‘open sea’, _&ast;laman_ ‘deep sea beyond the reef’, _&ast;ŋalun_ ‘mounting wave, ocean wave’, _&ast;bayau_ ‘ocean swell’, _&ast;loka_ (N) ‘high sea, heavy breakers’, (V) ‘be rough, of sea’, _&ast;maqati_ ‘low tide, dry reef,’ _&ast;Ruap_ ‘high tide’, _&ast;sakaRu_ ‘coral reef’, _&ast;motu(s)_ ‘detached reef’, _&ast;laje_ ‘coral’, _&ast;mʷaloq_ ‘submerged rock or coral reef’, _&ast;namo_ ‘lagoon inside reef, deep pool in reef’, _&ast;mata (qi, ni) sawa(n,ŋ)_ ‘passage through reef’, _&ast;(b,bʷ)iker_ ‘beach, esp. sandy beach’, _&ast;nusa_ ‘island’, _&ast;tobʷa_ ‘bay’, _&ast;(i,u)cuŋ_ ‘cape’.


<a id="p-177"></a>

POc speakers were also farmers. They cultivated a range of ground and tree crops ([vol.1, ch.5](ContributionTable#cldf:1-5); vol. 3, chs 9–13) and kept pigs ([vol.4:237](ContributionTable?anchor=p-237#cldf:4-5)–240) and chickens ([vol.4:283](ContributionTable?anchor=p-283#cldf:4-6)–287). Terms for clearing garden land (_&ast;quma_, _&ast;poki_), for a plantation (_&ast;topa_) and fallow land (_&ast;talun_) contrasted with one for bushland, inland country (_&ast;qutan_). There were terms for planting (_&ast;tanum_), planting in holes in the ground (_&ast;asok_), weeding (_&ast;papo_), scattering seeds (_&ast;kabu(R)_), garden fence (_&ast;kaRi_), and boundary marker in a garden (_&ast;bayat_) ([vol.1, ch.5](ContributionTable#cldf:1-5)).


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Kinds of domestic buildings


That POc speakers occupied permanent dwellings is indicated by a host of terms to do with house construction. Terms for several kinds of buildings can be reconstructed. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1987) ([1987](Source#cldf:Blust1987)) compared four different cognate sets, widely represented in Austronesian languages, that refer to kinds of domestic buildings. He reconstructs Proto Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) _&ast;Rumaq_ ‘dwelling house’ _&ast;balay_ ‘public building’, _&ast;kamaliR_ ‘men’s house’ and _&ast;lepaw_ ‘granary’.[^2] The first three terms were continued in POc.

[PAn &ast;_Rumaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-3-None-177-POc-rumaq-a)


<a id="p-178"></a>

A host of reconstructed POc terms for house parts and construction, including the following, indicate that at least some dwelling houses were substantial buildings, with heavy superstructure, gabled, with floor raised on piles (for supporting cognates see [vol.1, ch.3](ContributionTable#cldf:1-3)):

- _&ast;gabʷari_ ‘the area underneath a raised house’ ([vol.1:51](ContributionTable?anchor=p-51#cldf:1-3))
- _&ast;pupuŋ(an)_ ‘ridgepole’ ([vol.1:53](ContributionTable?anchor=p-53#cldf:1-3)), from PMP _&ast;bubuŋ_ ([Dempwolff 1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938); [Zorc 1994](Source#cldf:Zorc1994)), PMP
  _&ast;buhuŋbuhuŋ_ ([Blust 1972b](Source#cldf:Blust1972b)) ‘ridgepole, ridge of the roof’
- _&ast;bou_ ‘probably main bearers or cross-beams supporting a raised floor or roof structure, or
  centre post supporting ridgepole’ ([vol.1:56](ContributionTable?anchor=p-56#cldf:1-3))
- _&ast;soka(r)_ ‘crossbeam, bracing timber’ ([vol.1:56](ContributionTable?anchor=p-56#cldf:1-3)), from PMP _&ast;seŋkar_ ‘transverse beams that
  support the roof of a house’ (ACD)
- _&ast;kaso_ ‘rafter’ ([vol.1:55](ContributionTable?anchor=p-55#cldf:1-3)), from PMP _&ast;kasaw_ ‘rafter’ ([Dempwolff 1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938))
- _&ast;qatop_ ‘thatch, roof’ ([vol.1:54](ContributionTable?anchor=p-54#cldf:1-3)), from PMP _&ast;qatep_ ‘thatch, roof’ ([Dempwolff 1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938))
- _&ast;turu(s)_ ‘probably weight-bearing post, supporting raised floor or ridgepole’ ([vol.1:55](ContributionTable?anchor=p-55#cldf:1-3)).

Some Oceanic-speaking societies distinguish by name more than one design of dwelling house. The Arosi speech community of Makira distinguishes at least the following kinds of ruma ‘house’ ([Fox 1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)):

|                   |                                                                                                                       |
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _ruma huri_       | a round house, taller than the well known Santa Cruz round house                                                      |
| _ruma gaura_      | a double, long house                                                                                                  |
| _ruma ora_        | a house with five pairs of posts or more                                                                              |
| _ruma pʷarapʷara_ | a house roughly built, with roof of fronds instead of thatching                                                       |
| _ruma raŋi_       | a house with two roofs, the second roof only above the upper part of the first, made by extending the rafters upwards |
| _ruma okera_      | like ruma raŋi but with the two roofs close together                                                                  |
| _ruma sinakuhi_   | house with rounded end                                                                                                |
| _ruma waiho_      | simplest form of oblong house with three pairs of posts                                                               |

Although no compound term consisting of _&ast;Rumaq_ plus modifier has so far been reconstructed for POc, the latter retained two PMP terms for buildings other than main dwelling houses.

POc _&ast;pale_, continuing PMP _&ast;balay_, has in some daughter languages replaced _&ast;Rumaq_ as the usual term for a dwelling house. However, in languages where both terms are retained reflexes of _&ast;balay_ and _&ast;pale_ generally refer to a simpler kind of building, such as an open-sided boat shed, shed for storing yams or garden shelter. The replacement was perhaps due to speakers habit of humorously referring to their dwelling house as a humbler kind of building.


<a id="p-179"></a>

[PMP &ast;_balay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-3-None-179-POc-pale-a)

POc _&ast;kamali(R)_ ‘men’s meeting house’ has reflexes in languages of the Admiralties and North and Central Vanuatu. Among the Ponam, a Titan speaking community of Manus, _kamal_ is the name both of a patrilineal descent group (a land-owning group) and of the men’s house of such a group ([Carrier & Carrier 1989](Source#cldf:CarrierandCarrier1989)). In Vanuatu the reflex of _&ast;kamali(R)_ refers to a building used by men of a village as a recreational centre, e.g. for drinking kava, and as a sleeping and living area for unmarried men and boys and male visitors.

[PMP &ast;_kamaliR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-3-None-179-POc-kamalir-a)


<a id="p-180"></a>

A term for ‘canoe house’, _&ast;v(a,o)lau_, is reconstructed for PCP. This term is formally cognate with a verb meaning make a sea voyage, which has antecedents in POc _&ast;palau(r)_ ‘make a sea voyage’ and PMP &ast;pa-laSud ‘go down to the sea or coast. ’

[PCP &ast;_v(a,o)lau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-3-None-180-PCP-vaolau-a)

In Sa’a and Ulawa, Malaita, SE Solomons, chiefs had a canoe house, _taoha_, built at the landing place of canoes. This served the double purpose of a house for the chief’s decorated canoe and a house where men congregated and slept ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):7, 34).

A term for ‘house site’ or ‘house foundation, consisting of a mound or platform of earth or coral rubble’, is attributable to PEOc. It has reflexes in Southeast Solomonic, Fijian, and Polynesian. It is cognate with a verb meaning ‘to pile up, heap, make a mound or wall’. House mounds are associated with houses without raised floors, which are characteristic of eastern Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia.

[PEOc &ast;_apu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-3-None-180-PEOc-apu-a)


<a id="p-181"></a>

[Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):375) writes of Sa’a communities that

> [i]n certain hamlets … there is more or less of an appearance of house mounds, but speaking generally there is nothing to correspond to the Fijian yavu … This is owing to the frequent changes of location in the past, and to the absence of anything like settled towns.


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. Settlement, village, hamlet


It is noteworthy that there is no very well supported POc reconstruction whose primary sense was ‘village’. There are several candidates, chiefly _&ast;pera_, _&ast;koro_, _&ast;malaqai_ and _&ast;panua_, but objections can be raised against each.

[POc &ast;_pera_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-4-None-181-POc-pera-a)


<a id="p-182"></a>

It can be seen that _&ast;pera_ is widely reflected in Southeast Solomonic languages, with meanings that range from ‘village’, ‘hamlet’, ‘habitation’, ‘house’, ‘named locality’ to ‘open space for dancing, courtyard’, ‘burial space’, ‘skull house’ and ‘land.’ Elsewhere in Oceanic only one secure reflex has been noted, in Manam, a North New Guinea language, where it is the usual term for ‘house’.

Some of these disparate meanings are better associated with other POc terms, e.g. ‘house’ with _&ast;Rumaq_ and _&ast;pale_ ([§5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3#cldf:6-5)), ‘open space in a village’ with _&ast;malaqai_ (see below), ‘land’, ‘inhabited place’ and perhaps ‘settlement’, with _&ast;panua_ ([§5.5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-5-1#cldf:6-5)).

The reflexes of POc _&ast;koro_ in Vanuatu and Polynesian indicate that it referred primarily to any enclosure that is fenced or protected by barriers and that it has later come to mean ‘village’ in languages of the Admiralty Islands, Fiji and Tonga.

[POc &ast;_koro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-4-None-182-POc-koro-a)

Another candidate, _&ast;malaqai_, is attested throughout Polynesian, where it denotes an open space in the middle of a village or in front of a house used for public activities, and in a North New Guinea language and a Papuan Tip language, where it refers to a village. Possible cognates appear in Tangga, a Meso-Melanesian language, but the data are problematic.[^5]

[POc &ast;_malaqai_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-4-None-182-POc-malaqai-a)


<a id="p-183"></a>

Another term whose reflexes in certain contemporary languages refer to a village plaza is POc _&ast;mʷalala_. However, in POc this probably had a more general meaning such as ‘land cleared of vegetation (but not planted or built on)’, as well as serving as a stative verb meaning ‘be cleared of vegetation’.

[POc &ast;_mʷalala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-4-None-183-POc-malala-a)

The semantics of POc _&ast;panua_ are discussed in [§5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-5#cldf:6-5).


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Territorial units and land tenure



<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. POc _&ast;panua_ ‘land, territory, inhabited place, community, etc.’


POc _&ast;panua_, which continues PMP _&ast;banua_, is very widely reflected in Oceanic languages, indeed more widespread than any of the terms reconstructed above. The persistence of _&ast;panua_ suggests that it denoted something of very fundamental importance in the early Oceanic worldview. However, reconstructing its semantic history is a considerable challenge because its reflexes in present-day languages show an even more puzzlingly disparate range of meanings than _&ast;pera_, _&ast;koro_, and _&ast;malaqai_. Some idea of how reflexes of _&ast;panua_ vary in meaning within and across different subgroups of Oceanic is given by the following sample.


<a id="p-184"></a>

[6-5-5-1-184-adm-mussau-anua](cf.csv#cldf:6-5-5-1-184-adm-mussau-anua)


<a id="p-185"></a>

This sample exhibits about 20 more or less distinct senses associated with reflexes of _&ast;panua_. The distribution of these senses across major subgroups of Oceanic is as in [Table 5.1](#table-5.1).

In his discussion of PMP _&ast;banua_ [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1987) ([1987](Source#cldf:Blust1987)) compared cognate sets from three putative subgroups of Malayo-Polynesian: Western Malayo-Polynesian (WMP), Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP), and South Halmahera-West New Guinea (SHWNG) as well as from Oceanic. Languages from the first three subgroups exhibit roughly the same range of glosses as can be found in Oceanic, with a few additions. For example:

If POc _&ast;panua_ had a single meaning, what was it? If it was polysemous, as its reflexes in many daughter languages are, which senses did it have? What paths led to the diverse senses found in contemporary languages?

In tackling these questions one meets a number of methodological problems, starting with the descriptive data. It must be said that the primary data, the definitions of &ast;panua reflexes given in bilingual dictionaries and wordlists of contemporary Oceanic languages, are often deficient. Most sources do not offer systematic definitions. Instead, the ‘definitions’ are typically single word glosses – serving as rough translations equivalents in the European target language. (This problem is not particular to dictionaries of Oceanic languages. It is systemic in that bilingual dictionaries are typically designed to be translation aids rather than to provide analytic definitions.) And such single word glosses as ‘land’, ‘earth’, ‘country’ and ‘people’ are themselves imprecise, because each has more than one sense. For example, the entry for __land__ in _The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ gives many senses, of which the following are relevant to our concerns:


<a id="p-187"></a>

   1) the solid part of the earth, as opposed to sea, water.
   2) ground or soil, esp. having a particular use or properties, e.g. fertile land, farm land.
   3) a part of the earths surface marked off by natural or political boundaries: a country,
      territory, domain.
   4) ground or territory as property, landed property.
   5) the country as opposed to the town.
   6) expanse of country of undefined extent, usu. with modifier, e.g. highland, uplands.

[Cruse](Source#cldf:Cruse1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Cruse1986):80-81) writes that

> Linguists who have worked in lexical semantics can be broadly divided into two categories: on the one hand there are those who believe that a word form is associated with a number (perhaps finite, perhaps not) of discrete senses; and, on the other, there are those who believe that the discreteness is illusory.

The second group prefer to think of variant readings of a single lexical form as forming a spectrum of senses, a continuum without clear boundaries, much like the colour spectrum or a dialect continuum. However, it is possible to have a foot in both camps. There are domains where the evidence favours analysis into discrete senses and domains where it favours analysis in terms of sense spectra. There are standard diagnostics for polysemy. These include the existence of synonyms, antonyms and contrasting forms restricted to particular senses, the construction of sentences with qualifying elements that are sensitive to sense differences, and the restriction of particular senses to occurrence in a small set of collocations or minor constructions.

Blust was impressed by the correspondence between the glosses for reflexes of _&ast;banua_ in Iban, a language of Borneo, and ’Are’are, of Malaita in the SE Solomons. There is an ethnographically rich dictionary of Iban ([Richards 1981](Source#cldf:Richards1981)) which gives the following definition:

> _menoa_/_menua_ area of land held and used by distinct community, esp. longhouse (_rumah_), including house, farms, gardens, fruit groves, cemetery, water and all forest within half a days journey. Use of the _menoa_ is only gained and maintained with much effort and danger, and by proper rites to secure and preserve a ritual harmony of all within it and the unseen forces involved; home, abode, place, district, country, region; _menoa laŋit_ ‘the heavens, abode of Petara and other deities.’

The definition of ’Are’are _hanua_ given by [Geerts](Source#cldf:Geerts1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Geerts1970)) mentions a very similar list of elements. Blust observes that in both Iban and ’Are’are the reflex of _&ast;banua_

> refers to an inhabited territory that includes not only the human population and dwellings, but also plant and animal forms that contribute to the maintenance of the human community. Drinking water is mentioned in both glosses, as well as the burial sites of the deceased….

He concludes that PMP _&ast;banua_ (and by implication POc _&ast;panua_) had a single but complex meaning.

> PMP _&ast;banua_, then, probably referred to an inhabited territory which included the village and its population together with everything that contributed to the life-support system of that community ([Blust 1987](Source#cldf:Blust1987):100).

This complex but unitary meaning, he suggests, is ‘fragmented’ into various more specific senses. Our view is that a stronger case can be made for treating POc _&ast;panua_ as a highly polysemous term, whose senses are distinct lexical units, differing from each other in features of grammar and in their semantic relations (synonymy, antonymy, etc.) to other lexical units. While the standard tests for polysemy cannot be applied directly to POc we can in principle apply them to contemporary languages for which the data allow systematic treatment of sense discriminations.


<a id="p-189"></a>

In Wayan, a dialect of Western Fijian, some eight senses of vanua can be distinguished ([Pawley and Sayaba 2022](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2022)). Most, if not all of these can be shown to contrast by one or another diagnostic criterion, as indicated in [Table 5.2](#table-5.2).

We can go a fair way towards making sense of the great diversity of glosses in the daughter languages by assuming that POc &ast;panua had a range of senses corresponding roughly to those shared by the Fijian languages and certain languages of various other subgroups, including Muyuw of Papuan Tip, ’Are’are of S.E. Solomonic, Tongan and Tikopia of Polynesian, and Rotuman.[^7] These are shown in [Table 5.3](#table-5.3).

The senses attributed to &ast;panua do not include ‘settlement’ or ‘village’. Closest to these is 3(a) ‘territory belonging to a community, inhabited place’. It seems likely that in POc this broader sense encompassed habitation sites and their residents but that in certain daughter languages it was narrowed to refer specifically to the cluster of buildings and associated features that make up a village. This development in turn provided a platform for a further narrowing to ‘house’ in a number of languages.

To sum up, the comparative lexical evidence assembled in sections 5.4 and 5.5 does not tell us whether POc speakers occupied sizeable villages or dispersed hamlets.

### 5.2. World and weather


We note in passing that sense 6 attributed to POc _&ast;panua_, the world of the diurnal cycle and weather, is present in various Oceanic languages in certain multiword expressions containing reflexes of _&ast;panua_. A sample is shown in [Table 5.4](#table-5.4).

From this material we can reconstruct a family of POc verbal constructions of the type of _&ast;qaco na panua_ ‘be(come) daylight, be sunrise’ and _&ast;boŋi na vanua_ ‘be(come) dark, nightfall’ (where _&ast;qaco_ and _&ast;boŋi_, otherwise ‘sun’ and ‘night’, are verbs), and a parallel set of complex nominal constructions of the type of _&ast;panua qaco_ ‘sunrise, sunny conditions, daytime’, _&ast;panua boŋi_ ‘nightfall, night time’ ([vol.2:40](ContributionTable?anchor=p-40#cldf:2-3)-41, 295).

### 5.3. Land tenure


Ann Chowning has written as follows of the range of variation in historically attested systems of land tenure in Melanesia.

> Title to land is usually vested in a corporate group, membership of which is likely to be based on descent, residence or some combination of the two….

> The details of systems of land tenure [in Melanesia] differ greatly from society to society. Some permit permanent alienation and individual ownership; others do not. It is not uncommon to find distinctions between gardening land, village land or house sites, and bush land, with different systems of rights applied to each, not to mention the rights that apply to sacred places, grave sites, paths, water supplies, sago swamps, and fishing areas. ([Chowning 1977](Source#cldf:Chowning1977):39)

The strongest candidate for an early Oceanic term for a landholding corporate group is _&ast;kainaŋa_ ([§4.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-2#cldf:6-5).6), which has reflexes in Micronesian and Polynesian. [Goodenough](Source#cldf:Goodenough1955) ([1955](Source#cldf:Goodenough1955)) observed that in Micronesian languages this term typically refers to a land-owning matrilineal descent group. [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a) ([2003a](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003a)) offer the following, less precise semantic reconstruction for PMic:

[PMic &ast;_kayinaŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-5-3-191-PMic-kayinaa-a)

For PPn we cite the reconstructions proposed by [Marck](Source#cldf:Marck2010) ([2010](Source#cldf:Marck2010)) and [Kirch and Green](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001)), which slightly modify those proposed by [Koskinen](Source#cldf:Koskinen1960) ([1960](Source#cldf:Koskinen1960)), [Marck](Source#cldf:Marck2008) ([2008](Source#cldf:Marck2008)) and [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1982a) ([1982a](Source#cldf:Pawley1982a), [1985](Source#cldf:Pawley1985)).

[PPn &ast;_kainaŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-5-3-191-PPn-kainaa-a)


<a id="p-192"></a>

PPn developed in the various islands of the Tonga-Samoa area after these were settled late in the first millennium BC, probably as a dialect network that remained quite cohesive for many centuries. Marck argues that PPn social organisation probably showed regional differences, with some smaller, less stratified island communities retaining the original use of _&ast;kainaŋa_ to refer to unilineal descent groups (as in Anuta, Tikopia, Pukapuka) and larger, more stratified societies developing cognatic descent groups, leading to a shift in the meaning of _&ast;kainaŋa_ from ‘descent group headed by a chief’ to ‘subjects of a chief, populace, commoners’. His arguments resemble those of [Burrows](Source#cldf:Burrows1939) ([1939](Source#cldf:Burrows1939)) who inferred that early Polynesian social grouping “consisted of descent groups which occupied and controlled territories and that this system was transformed repeatedly and in various ways” in different parts of Polynesia ([Kirch and Green 2001](Source#cldf:KirchandGreen2001):208).

The term _&ast;tau_ ‘person, human being’ is well attested in both PMP and POc. A number of compound nominals containing _&ast;tau_ have been reconstructed, including POc _&ast;tau mate_ ‘dead person, corpse, ghost’, _&ast;tau paqoRu_ ‘young adult of marriageable age’ and PEOc _&ast;tau tasi_ ‘fisherman, expert mariner’ ([Pawley 1985](Source#cldf:Pawley1985); [vol.5:39](ContributionTable?anchor=p-39#cldf:5-2)–42). In some compounds _&ast;tau_ has the sense of ‘owner’ or ‘person intimately associated with an entity’, e.g. POc _&ast;tau (ni) waga_ ‘owner of a canoe’ and PPn _&ast;tau fale_ ‘owner or occupant of a house’. This use of _&ast;tau_ is often associated with phrasal constructions reflecting the form _&ast;tau ni N_, where the linker _ni_ marks an associative relation, e.g. Dobuan, a Papuan Tip language, has such terms as _to-ni-ʔasa_ ‘owner of a village’, _to-ni-butu_ ‘owner of a feast’, i.e. ‘master of ceremonies’, _to-ni-to-ni-bwaʔa_ ‘sprites’, lit. ‘little owners of the land’ ([Grant 1953](Source#cldf:Grant1953)) and Molima, another Papuan Tip language, has _to-ni-bwaʔo_ ‘owner of a garden’ and _to-ni-waga_ ‘canoe owner’ ([Chowning 1958](Source#cldf:Chowning1958)).

The compound _&ast;tau panua_ ‘native of a place, land owner’ is reconstructable for PEOc. Although no reflexes have so far been noted beyond EOc, it is likely that it was present in POc. Both the constituents and the construction type are attributable to POc.

[PEOc &ast;_tau panua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:6-5-5-3-192-PEOc-taupanua-a)


<a id="p-193"></a>

Some Polynesian languages reflect a structurally parallel, functionally equivalent compound, _&ast;taŋata (qi) fanua_, in which _&ast;tau_ ‘person, owner’ is replaced by _&ast;taŋata_ ‘person’.

[6-5-5-3-193-pn-tongan-taataifonua](cf.csv#cldf:6-5-5-3-193-pn-tongan-taataifonua)

From _&ast;panua_, sense 3, and the compound _&ast;tau panua_ we can draw the unsurprising inference that POc speakers were divided into communities with recognised territories over which members had rights.

## 6. Conclusions


Linguistic evidence cannot definitively answer all the questions asked at the outset of this essay but it can tell us some things about Proto Oceanic speakers settlement patterns and relation to territory.

A strong prima facie case can be made that the POc speakers preferred to live close to the sea. Fishing and reef foraging was central to the economy and there was an extensive vocabulary relating to canoes and sea travel. Three kinds of buildings can be identified by name: _&ast;Rumaq_, main dwelling house, _&ast;kamaliR_, men’s meeting house and _&ast;pale_, a less substantial building, such as a shed for storage or other non-residential purposes. _&ast;malaqai_ may have referred to a village plaza or public space in a settlement, but the semantic reconstruction is not secure. A term for canoe shed, _&ast;(a-)v(a,o)lau_, is reconstructable for PCP but not for POc. There is no term attributable to POc whose primary sense was ‘village’ or ‘settlement’ and it is unclear whether POc speakers lived in scattered hamlets or substantial villages; _&ast;panua_ appears to have been used to refer to any inhabited place, as well as to the whole territory belonging to a community, including land cleared for gardens, and to the people of a place. The compound _&ast;tau panua_ ‘person belonging to a place, land owner’ is reconstructable for PEOc and on logical grounds it can be inferred that it was present in POc but lost in non-EOc languages.

A term for a land-owning descent group, _&ast;kainaŋa_, is attributable to PROc, being reflected in both Micronesian and Polynesian languages but not in Western Oceanic, SE Solomonic or the Admiralties. As such, this term can be associated with the bearers of Lapita culture who moved into Remote Oceania but not with the Early Western Lapita tradition found in the Bismarck Archipelago.


## Notes

[^1]: Architecture and settlement patterns in the POc speech community were the subject of a chapter in vol. 1 of The lexicon of Proto Oceanic ([Green and Pawley 1998](Source#cldf:GreenandPawley1998)) but that volume focused on the material culture of the POc language community and it seems appropriate to return to a consideration of settlement patterns in a volume on POc society. The late Roger Green is included as co-author of the present chapter because it draws heavily on [Green and Pawley](Source#cldf:GreenandPawley1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:GreenandPawley1998)). Section 5 of the present chapter, on _&ast;panua_, is a reworking of [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Pawley2005)), which in turn drew on [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1987) ([1987](Source#cldf:Blust1987)) and [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Pawley1979)).

[^2]: Tryon proposes the gloss ‘granary’ for PMP _&ast;lepaw_ rather than ‘men’s house’ on the grounds that (a) dedicated men’s houses are not a characteristic of Austronesian-speaking societies outside of Melanesia and (b) in some such societies reflexes of PMP _&ast;kamaliR_ refer to granaries.

[^3]: Some scholars reconstruct POc _&ast;Rumʷaq_ with labiovelar _&ast;mʷ_ but at least some labiovelar reflexes are likely to be secondary developments following the high back rounded vowel ([Blust 1981a](Source#cldf:Blust1981a)).

[^4]: If the NCV forms reflect _&ast;pera_, one would have to posit (a) final _&ast;-q_ on _&ast;peraq_; (b) vowel metathesis; (c) nominalisation with _&ast;-an_, i.e. PNCV _&ast;vareʔa_ < _&ast;peraq-an_.

[^5]: In the dictionary of Tangga ([Bell 1977](Source#cldf:Bell1977)) _male_ ‘village’ and _male-lil_ ‘village square’ appear in the English-Tangga finder list but not in the main (Tangga-English) dictionary. Conversely, _ma:li_ ‘dancing square’ appears in the Tangga-English part but not in the finder list.

[^6]: The orthography of the Wayan Fijian dictionary is retained in the table.

[^7]: The process that Blust refers to as semantic fragmentation is thus better viewed as a change in membership of a family of lexical units as a result of sense transfer rather than the splitting of a single complex sense. In reflexes of _&ast;panua_ in daughter languages certain individual senses were retained, others were transferred to different lexical forms. For instance, in some languages reflexes of _&ast;panua_ have retained the central senses of ‘land (not sea)’, ‘land mass, country’ and ‘homeland, home place’ but have lost the peripheral sense of ‘weather’ or ‘world subject to weather.’ Conversely, in Lau _fanua_, only the peripheral sense of ‘weather’ or ‘world subject to weather’ has been retained.

[^8]: Several Eastern Polynesian languages reflect a compound _&ast;mata kainaŋa_. _&ast;mata_ probably derives from PCP _&ast;mata (qi)_ ‘group of people serving a common purpose’, which was evidently preposed to nouns denoting kinds of social groups. Compare Bauan Fijian _mata-sere_ ‘choir,’ _mata-bete_ ‘hierarchy of priests’, _mata-qali_ ‘clan, social division’, _mata-i-valu_ ‘army.’

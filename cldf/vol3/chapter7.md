## 1. Introduction


This chapter focuses principally on the lowland tropical rain forests of New Britain and New Ireland, the large islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, as these are the forests whose margins - at the very least - would have been familiar to Proto Oceanic (POc) speakers. It would be appropriate also to include the rain forests of the Admiralties, but little is known about them ([World Wildlife Fund 2007a](Source#cldf:WWF2007a)). Some attention is also given to the other islands of NW Island Melanesia, namely Bougainville and the Solomons, as they were occupied by speakers of early Oceanic dialects which were perhaps barely distinct from POc.

Also included here are trees which grow in freshwater swamp forest, a habitat that is not common in the Bismarcks, though more widespread in Bougainville and parts of the Solomons ([ch.2, §3.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1-3#cldf:3-2)). Excluded are (i) plants that mainly occur in littoral forest (see chapter 5) and (ii) plants that occur in the wild but are also tended or cultivated to some degree (see chapters 9-11 and 13).

In POc times, the Bismarcks would have been almost completely covered in rain forest, and much of their area remained so until 30 years ago, although there were of course substantial portions of secondary forest resulting from the agricultural activities of Oceanic speakers over 3000 years ([ch.2, §3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-2)).[^1]

Although New Britain and New Ireland have two distinct soil types, one limestone-based, the other volcanic, there is surprisingly little difference in their species composition. Major lowland rain forest tree genera include Pometia, _Octomeles_, _Alstonia_, Campnosperma, _Canarium_, _Dracontomelon_, _Pterocymbium_, Crytocarya, Intsia, _Ficus_, _Terminalia_ and _Vitex_.


<a id="p-186"></a>

Compared with mainland New Guinea the overall diversity of tree species in Bismarcks lowland forests is not impressive. Missing are the two conifers _Araucaria hunsteinii_ and _Araucaria cunninghamii_ that tower above the lowland broadleaf forests in New Guinea. The dipterocarps (Dipterocarpaceae) that dominate much of peninsular and island southeast Asia are represented by only three species in New Guinea, and probably not at all in the Bismarcks ([World Wildlife Fund 2007b](Source#cldf:WWF2007b)).

Freshwater swamp forests on New Britain and New Ireland include Campnosperma brevipetiolata ([§4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:3-7)), _Terminalia brassii_, the sago palm (_Metroxylon sagu_), and species of _Pandanus_. Limestone forests near the coast of southern New Ireland and along the coast and interior of New Britain are dominated by _Vitex cofassus_ ([World Wildlife Fund 2007b](Source#cldf:WWF2007b)).

## 2. Rain forest layers


A rain forest typically has four or five layers (opinions differ on the division of the lower layers), and these provided the basis for the organisation of this chapter.[^2]

The tallest trees, spaced well apart, jut out above the forest canopy with umbrella-shaped crowns at heights of over 50 m. These __emergent trees__, treated in [§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-7), have straight, smooth trunks with few branches. They need to be able to withstand high temperatures and drying winds and tend to have small, pointed leaves. Some species lose their leaves during the brief dry season in monsoon rainforests.

The __canopy__ ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-7)) contains a majority of the larger trees, typically 30--50 m tall, and its adjacent treetops provide a more or less continuous cover of broad-leaved evergreen foliage. The branches of the upper portion of the canopy often support a rich flora of epiphytes, including orchids, mosses, and lichens. The canopy receives plenty of sunlight, but allows only a small amount to penetrate to the layers below. The leaves are formed in such a way as to allow rain to run off. This keeps them dry and prevents mold and mildew from forming in the humid environment. Many canopy tree species have large buttresses at the base of the trunk. Formerly believed to help support the tree, it is now believed that the buttresses channel dissolved nutrients to the shallow root system.

The __understorey__ has two parts: a __lower canopy__ ([§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:3-7)) consisting of trees around 20m in height and a __shrub layer__ ([§6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6#cldf:3-7)) of small trees, shrubs, herbs and ferns able to survive on the 5% of sunlight which reaches the understorey. Understorey plants tend to have large leaves in order to catch as much as possible of the sparsely dappled sunlight: they are largely protected from winds which would damage large leaves in the canopy. Some trees have larger leaves when they are shorter but smaller leaves when they reach canopy height. Large woody vines climb the trees to capture sunlight. There is little air movement and constantly high humidity in the understorey.

The __forest floor__ ([§7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:3-7)) receives only 2% of the rainforest's sunlight, and only specially adapted plants can grow under these conditions. Away from river banks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively empty of vegetation. It also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which decays rapidly in the warmth and humidity to be absorbed by the trees' shallow roots. Many forms of fungi grow here, assisting in the decay.

## 3. Emergent trees


Emergent trees are those which regularly grow to 50 m or more. There are also a number of canopy trees that grow taller and acquire emergent status in some localities. These are noted in the various subsections of [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-7).


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. _Alstonia scholaris_, milky pine, canoe tree, TP _kanu_ (Apocynaceae)


_Alstonia scholaris_ is an emergent or tall canopy tree, growing straight to a height of 30--50 m or more, with few branches on its trunk. It grows only in the forest, often near rivers ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 146). It is a salient tree in the Bismarcks and the Solomons, but it is rare in Remote Oceania, probably because its use there in constructing large canoes has put the survival of at least taller specimens under pressure (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.).

The straight trunk with its lightweight wood is used in many locations for making canoes, for beams, for shark-trap and fishing-net floats and for carving ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 441, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 146). At Teop (north Bougainville), the tree is known simply as _sinivi_ 'canoe' ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)). Wood from buttresses was used for the tall prows of Marovo war canoes.

On New Britain the latex is said to relieve colds ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)). At Marovo the sap or bark scrapings boiled in water is a medicine for stomach ache.

At Marovo too, the dead were commonly buried in a sitting position between the buttresses of _Alstonia scholaris_, and so it was associated with the departure of the spirits of the dead, resulting in taboos against felling it.

A PMP form for '_Alstonia scholaris_', namely _&ast;ditah_, is reconstructable (ACD), but I have found no Oceanic reflexes of this. Despite their apparent variation, the reflexes of POc _&ast;sabakap_ below are largely regular. Kara, Patpatar and Nehan reflect regular loss of _&ast;-k-_ but retain the final consonant. NNG languages, Nakanai and SES languages lose the final consonant. The Choiseul languages Varisi, Avaso, Ririo, Babatana and Sisingga reflect Proto Northwest Solomonic _&ast;baɣava_ (for †_&ast;abaɣava_) in which initial _&ast;s-_ is lost through lenition (a sporadic process) and the final consonant is retained with the addition of an echo vowel.

### 3.2. _Falcataria moluccana_ (syn. _Albizia falcataria_, _Albizia moluccana_, _Albizia falcata_, _Paraserianthes falcataria_) (Mimosaceae)


<a id="fig-3-7_1"> </a>

[__Figure 7.1:__ _Falcataria moluccana_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-7_1)



_Falcataria moluccana_ was until recently known as _Albizia falcataria_. Because there are items in the data glossed '_Albizia_ sp.' which may in fact denote _Falcataria moluccana_, the genera _Falcataria_ and _Albizia_ are handled together here.

The small-leafed crown of _Falcataria moluccana_ emerges above all other trees in Bismarcks rain forests. It grows to between 30 and 60 m in height with a trunk up to 1 m in diameter ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 207-208), but it is brittle and can come crashing to the ground (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.).

On New Britain and on Manus its trunk is used for canoe hulls, on New Britain also for slitgongs ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 94, [O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989)). However, McClatchey points out that it does not serve these purposes well, as objects made from it don't last. It is more likely to be given to learner carvers or canoe-makers for practice.

The reconstruction of a term (or terms) for _Falcataria moluccana_ is difficult. [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 107), discussing the similar _Albizia salomonensis_ on Malaita, say that it only grows close to rivers and prefers sandy soils. If the same is true of _Falcataria moluccana_, then its occurrence in Bismarcks rain forests three thousand years ago may have been rather rare, resulting in the frequent loss of inherited terms for the species. Alternatively, the fact that it has little use may account for the dearth of cognates ([ch.14, §2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:3-14)).

All three reconstructions below entail uncertainties. POc _&ast;babak_ has just two reflexes. With regard to POc _&ast;pail_ and _&ast;kai(k)_, POc vowel sequences like _&ast;-ai-_ were fairly rare, and it is possible that _&ast;q_ intervened between _&ast;a_ and _&ast;i_, but _&ast;-q-_ is reflected in none of the modern languages nor in the CMP cognates which support the reconstruction of PCEMP _&ast;bail_[^3] and _&ast;ka(w)iak_.[^4] The latter is reconstructed with an uncertain medial _-w-_, reflected in E Sumba _kawia[ka]_. If _-w-_ was present at an earlier stage, it is irregularly lost in Nakanai _kai_.

<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. _Octomeles sumatrana_, TP _erima_ (Datiscaceae)


_Octomeles sumatrana_ is one of the tallest trees in the Bismarck Archipelago and Bougainville, at 40-80 m tall with huge buttresses, above which the trunk of soft white wood is up to 2.5 m in diameter ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 391). The nectar-rich flowers attract flying foxes ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)). The wood is widely used in the Bismarcks to make canoes ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):391, [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989):93, [Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen n.d.](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagennd)).

_Octomeles sumatrana_ is apparently of little significance in the Solomons ([Whitmore 1966](Source#cldf:Whitmore1966))[^5] and does not occur at all in Vanuatu, to judge from its absence from [Gowers](Source#cldf:Gowers1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976)) and [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992)).

The reconstruction below is for PWOc only, but this is not surprising in view of the limited distribution. Two versions of the reconstruction are supported, _&ast;kuRim(a,o)_ and _&ast;iRim(a,o)_. They overlap geographically, and their initial syllables may simply reflect different prefixes ([ch.2, §7.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-2#cldf:3-2)).

## 4. The forest canopy


As a rough rule of thumb, trees of the forest canopy are assumed to be those which grow to between 30 and 50 m. There are also several species, noted in the subsections of [§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:3-7), which are usually sub-canopy trees but which grow taller in some localities and become part of the canopy itself.

Certain trees of the forest canopy are treated elsewhere in this volume. Strangler figs become part of the forest canopy by using an existing tree as host to piggyback their way into the light (ch.1 0, [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-7)). _Canarium_ species and _Terminalia_ species, especially _Terminalia kaernbachii_, and _Pometia pinnata_, are canopy trees in the Bismarcks, but have also long been cultivated, the first two for their nuts and _Pometia pinnata_ for its fruit, and are thus treated in ch.11 (§[§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-7), 2.4 and 3.5 respectively).

There are several canopy trees that are only reported from lowland rain forests in the Solomons but not in the Bismarcks, and for some of these no POc term can be reconstructed. This is perhaps significant, given that the POc homeland is believed to have been in the Bismarcks ([vol.2, ch.2](ContributionTable#cldf:2-2)). These trees are _Gmelina moluccana_, _Pterocymbium_ species, _Schizomeria serrata_ and _Terminalia calamansanai_ ([Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 53-54).


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. _Campnosperma brevipetiolatum_ (Anacardiaceae)


_Campnosperma brevipetiolatum_ is a large canopy tree, growing up to 50 m in height. Its straight smooth trunk has a cylindrical bole, usually up to 1.2 min diameter and occasionally as much as 2m ([Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

The Bola of New Britain use it for canoe hulls ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)). The Marovo consider it inferior to _Gmelina moluccana_ for this purpose, but good for house planks ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 134).

_Campnosperma brevipetiolatum_ is apparently not found in Remote Oceania, and its distribution in the Bismarcks and the Solomons seems to be patchy, as it is missing from the usually very thorough [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)) and [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988)). There is just one weakly supported POc term for the species, namely _&ast;olaŋa_.


<a id="p-191"></a>

[POc &ast;_olaŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-4-1-191-POc-olaa-a)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. _Cinnamomum_ spp., wild cinnamon (Lauraceae)


Trees of the genus _Cinnamomum_ grow to 30 m. They are known for their barks, which are widely processed to make spices and to extract essential oils. Only one of the items in the cognate set supporting POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ '_Cinnamomum_ sp.' includes a species-level identification within the genus _Cinnamomum_: Lou _moso_ is glossed as _Cinnamomum xanthoneuron_, a 'wild cinnamon'. This is not one of the three species that provide commercial cinnamon bark,[^6] but one of two tree species exploited by German traders on the north coast of New Guinea under German colonial rule and into the 1930s for their essential oils. The other was not a _Cinnamomum_ species but _Cryptocarya aromatica_ (syn. _Cryptocarya massoy_, _Massoia aromatica_), and there was much confusion as to which oil came from the bark of which tree. The oils from these two species are known as lawag oil and massoia oil.[^7] It is possible that Mager's gloss of the Bing and Gedaged reflexes as _Cryptocarya aromatica_ reflects this confusion and that the intended denotatum was _Cinnamomum xanthoneuron_. At any rate, it seems likely that POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ did indeed denote _Cinnamomum xanthoneuron_. The fragrance of _Cinnamomum xanthoneuron_ (and/or _Cryptocarya aromatica_) bark was known to the traditional residents of north New Guinea and the Bismarcks, as Mager (19 52: 204) reports in his gloss of the Gedaged and Bing items,

> The bark is used a great deal in sorcery. It is chewed and spit [sic] out into the face of the spirits, so as to drive them away. A piece of bark is carried in the net bag to keep evil spirits from harming the child.

[Arentz et al.](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 92) also report that on New Britain the bark is consumed as a medicine against fever and stomach pain.

POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ has cognates in the languages of Java: Sundanese _maŋsoi_, Javanese _masoyi_, _masogi_, Madurese _masoji_, all denoting massoia oil rather than a tree species. The species label 'massoy' and the term 'massoia' are probably derived from the Javanese term, but, as a result of the confusion between the two oils, are applied to _Cryptocarya aromatica_, syn. massoy, and its essential oil, rather than to _Cinnamomum xanthoneuron_. It seems likely, incidentally, that Are _masoɣi_ (for †_masou_) is a borrowing, perhaps indirectly, from Javanese, rather than a directly inherited reflex of _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_.[^8]


<a id="p-192"></a>

The reflexes of POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ reveal a further set of complications. ([Blust 1981a](Source#cldf:Blust1981a)) glosses the Lou and Nauna terms '_Cananga odorata_' ([§5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-7)), rather than a _Cinnamomum_ species, and this is also the gloss of the Meso-Melanesian reflexes. Fijian has two terms: Bauan _maðou_ 'wild cinnamon, _Cinnamomum_ sp.' and Bauan _makosoi_ / Wayan _mākosoi_, both '_Cananga odorata_'. The latter appear to be metathesised forms of a PCP compound _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso-koi_ 'perfume tree, _Cananga odorata_'.[^9] This raises the possibility that POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ denoted _Cananga odorata_ as well as cinnamon, i.e. that it denoted a taxon of perfumed trees. PCP then seems to have distinguished between _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso_ 'cinnamon' and _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso-koi_ '_Cananga odorata_'.

The possibility that there was such a taxon is strengthened by an observation by Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) that the quote from Mager above could also be applied to the Fijian and Western Polynesian use of _Cananga odorata_.

The Meso-Melanesian forms below, apparently reflecting PMM _&ast;mud(e)u_ (rather than †_&ast;moso(u)_) are problematic. They may reflect a PMM borrowing or a non-cognate chance resemblance.

<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. _Dillenia schlechteri_ (syn. _Dillenia macrophylla_) (Dilleniaceae)


There are many _Dillenia_ species in SE Asia and Oceania, some of them tall canopy trees, others smaller trees of the lower canopy.[^10] Only one species is reported from the Bismarcks ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 375, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)), _Dillenia schlechteri_, a canopy tree 30--50 m tall with a light red trunk. However, there is linguistic evidence in the form of POc _&ast;drokol_ ([§5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4#cldf:3-7)) that at least one sub-canopy species was known to POc speakers.

In the Admiralties _Dillenia schlechteri_ is used for house construction. The timber is said to last over 30 years if it is not exposed to the elements ([O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989)).

The second and third vowels and the possible final consonant of POc _&ast;kulapu(R)_ '_Dillenia_ schlechteri' are due to the reconstruction of PMP _&ast;kelabuR_ 'large _Dillenia_ species' on the basis of the data below and of Blit Manobo _klambug (daka)_ '_Dillenia megalantha_' (cf[§5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4#cldf:3-7)), Bagobo _kalambok_, Lanao _kalambuguy_,[^11] both '_Dillenia philippinensis_' ([Madulid 2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 100).

### 4.4. _Dracontomelon dao_ (syn. _Dracontomelon mangiferum_, _Dracontomelon edule_), New Guinea walnut, Dragon plum, TP _mon_, B _nakatambol_ (Anacardiaceae)


<a id="fig-3-7_3"> </a>

[__Figure 7.3:__ _Dracontomelon dao_, New Guinea Walnut.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-7_3)



The New Guinea walnut tree, _Dracontomelon dao_, is massive, usually reaching 30-35 m, and occasionally 50 m, in height. It has large buttresses and above the buttresses often has a circumference of 3-5 m. At a height of about 7-10 m the trunk divides into a pair of large branches. Each of them continues to divide upwards and sideways recursively to form a large umbrella-shaped crown. The leaves are made up of 6 to 10 leaflets with a smooth edge ([Figure 7.3](#fig-3-7_3)). The fruit are small, 2-3 cm in diameter, and have five flecks around them. The small amount of flesh around the flattened seed is edible but tart and is consumed fresh ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 323, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 238). _Dracontomelon dao_ occurs from SE Asia to the Solomons ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 158).

Bourke (in preparation, n.d.) writes that although _Dracontomelon dao_ was traditionally a significant fruit in the area around Madang, it is unimportant or absent elsewhere in the lowlands of New Guinea. Places where it is recorded as being eaten are the Schouten Islands off the mouth of the Sepik River, some of the small islands in the Admiralties, some islands in SE Papua, the Duke of York Islands (between New Britain and New Ireland), Nissan Island (between New Ireland and Bougainville) and Bougainville. The only report of cultivation comes from French, who says it is sometimes planted from seed.

Two terms are reconstructable: POc _&ast;raqu(p)_ and PNCV _&ast;katabola_. The final bracketed _&ast;-p_ of _&ast;raqu(p)_ is added to take account of th1e final consonants of the Patpatar and Tolai reflexes. However, there are no known non-Oceanic reflexes of _&ast;-p_. The PCP _&ast;tawa-raqu_ '_Dracontomelon vitiense_' contains a reflex of POc _&ast;tawan_ '_Pometia pinnata_' ([ch. 11, §3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5#cldf:3-11)) as its first element, as the fruits of the two plants are similar in appearance ([Geraghty 2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 80).

### 4.5. _Dysoxylum_ spp., stinktree, stinkwood, B _stingwud_ (Meliaceae)


<a id="fig-3-7_4"> </a>

[__Figure 7.4:__ _Dysoxylum arborescens_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-7_4)



A number of _Dysoxylum_ species grow in NW Island Melanesia, ranging from the tall canopy tree _Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum_ (syn. _D. amooriodes_) sometimes growing to 35 m, to the sub-canopy tree _Dysoxylum kaniense_. An important tree between these extremes is _Dysoxylum arborescens_, also a canopy tree, but usually only 20--30 m high ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 157-160, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 181, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

A salient feature of all _Dysoxylum_ species is their strong smell, which varies from species to species: some are unpleasant, some pleasant (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.). The unpleasant smell of certain _Dysoxylum_ species has earned them the English name 'stinktree' or 'stinkwood': when the bark is stripped off and fresh wood is exposed, _Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum_ is said by the Kwara'ae to smell like a man who has not washed and _Dysoxylum kaniense_ to have a smell that induces vomiting ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 122, 181). [Whistler](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b) ([1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 93) comments that the leaves have 'a disagreeable odor'. Despite the smell, the wood of _Dysoxylum_ species is a useful hardwood, and the timber of the larger species is widely used for house posts ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 93, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 157, 162, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 122).


<a id="p-196"></a>

POc _&ast;maqota_ perhaps denoted a taxon including several _Dysoxylum_ species. All the species mentioned in the glosses below are tall canopy trees except _Dysoxylum kaniense_ and _Dysoxylum spectabile_, but this is perhaps because the larger species are more widespread and more salient.

### 4.6. _Elaeocarpus_ spp. (Elaeocarpaceae)


_Elaeocarpus_ species in NW Island Melanesia include the large canopy trees _Elaeocarpus angustifolius_ (syn. _Elaeocarpus sphaericus_) with its distinctively cornflower-blue fruit and _Elaeocarpus floridanus_, more common in the Solomons than the Bismarcks, with dark blue or black fruit (syn. _Elaeocarpus pseudosepicanus_), both 25 or more metres tall, as well as shrub-sized trees of the understorey like _Elaeocarpus edulis_ (syn. _Aceratium oppositifolium_), 3-6 m tall, with its 4 x 3cm ellipsoid apple-red fruit. The fruits of all species are inedible ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 352-353, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 85, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 123).

The large species provide wood for house beams at various locations ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 94), but Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) finds that it is not useful in the traditional communities which he has studied.

Although plenty of names for _Elaeocarpus_ species have been collected, surprisingly few of them form cognate sets - none at all for POc or Western Oceanic, and one each for PEOc and PSV. The absence of a POc or PWOc term perhaps exemplifies the principle that the names of less useful plants are easily forgotten ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:3-7)), so that present-day names reflect new coinages at different island Melanesian localities. Alternatively, it may be that _Elaeocarpus_ species were rare in the environments of early Oceanic speakers: the botanical literature suggests that large _Elaeocarpus_ species are significant contributors to the canopy of lowland rain forests in Bougainville and the Solomons but not in the Bismarcks where POc was spoken ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976):64--65, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998):53-54, 60--61).

Two reconstructions are presented below. PEOc _&ast;melo_ '_Elaeocarpus angustifolius_' is supported by just two reflexes, but the languages are sufficiently far apart to preclude borrowing.

### 4.7. _Endospermum_ spp., cheesewood, milkwood, whitewood, PNG basswood, B _waetwud_, _melektri_ (Euphorbiaceae)


Within island Melanesia _Endospermum medullosum_ ([Figure 7.5](#fig-3-7_5), left) is present in the Bismarcks, the Solomons and Vanuatu; _Endospermum moluccanum_ is reported only from the Bismarcks ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 313, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):91, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 135). Occasionally an emergent tree, otherwise a large canopy tree up to 45 m high, _Endospermum medullosum_ has a markedly fluted bole of 45-100 cm diameter, sometimes crooked, sometimes straight and up to 25 m long. It has a distinctive crown, shallow, flat-topped and umbrella-like. Its distribution is limited by the fact that it does not tolerate shade: it grows well only where there are gaps in the canopy ([Thomson 2006a](Source#cldf:Thomson2006a)).

A somewhat smaller but similar member of the genus is _Endospermum moluccanum_ (syn. _Endospermum formicarum_),[^14] sometimes a canopy tree up to 25m high, sometimes a sub-canopy tree ([Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

Both species have lightweight wood that is used for fishing-net floats. [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 315) reports from New Ireland that the pith of the twigs of _Endospermum moluccanum_ is usually destroyed by black ants, which inhabit the resulting space. [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 115) report from Kwara'ae that _Endospermum medullosum_ is not used in house construction because the wood is eaten by insects.

POc _&ast;koma(r,R)(o,u)_ may have referred to either or both species. Like the large _Elaeocarpus_ species ([§4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6#cldf:3-7)), _Endospermum_ species are not prominent in Bismarcks rain forests, and appear to have undergone a good deal of local re-naming.

### 4.8. _Garuga floribunda_ (syn. _Garuga abilo_), B _namalaus_ (Burseraceae)


_Garuga floribunda_ is a canopy tree which grows to a height of up to 25m in Vanuatu and up to 35m in Papua New Guinea ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):63, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)). It has a short bole and steeply rising branches, often with a flat crown ([Johns 1976](Source#cldf:Johns1976): 195). According to [Paijmans](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 52) its occurrence is limited to the few locations where there is a marked dry season.

There is apparently a traditional perception that _Garuga floribunda_ resembles the smaller _Spondias cytherea_, noted by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 283) for New Ireland and reflected in PNCV _&ast;mala-usi_ '_Garuga floribunda_', reconstructed below. The perception is apparently based on the fact that both trees lose their leaves and are bare between flowering and fruiting. PNCV _&ast;mala-usi_ consists of a reflex of the POc prefix _&ast;mala-_ 'resembling' ([ch.2, §7.1.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-4#cldf:3-2)) plus PNCV _&ast;usi_ '_Spondias cytherea_' (ch.ll, [§3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:3-7)), i.e. its original meaning was evidently 'resembing _Spondias cytherea_'. As noted below, there are also unprefixed reflexes of PNCV _&ast;usi_ which denote _Garuga floribunda_.

PCP _&ast;manaui_ '_Garuga floribunda_', also below, appears cognate with the PNCV form, but the medial consonants do not correspond, suggesting that one of the two forms is the result of borrowing. Since PNCV _&ast;mala-_ regularly reflects POc _&ast;mala-_, but PCP _&ast;mana-_ (instead of expected †_&ast;mala-_) does not, it is the Central Pacific forms that appear to reflect a borrowing.

### 4.9. _Intsia bijuga_ (syn. _Intsia amboinensis_, _Afzelia bijuga_), ironwood, island teak, TP _kwila_, B _natora_ (Cisalpiniaceae)


One of the larger trees of the forests of NW Island Melanesia, _Intsia bijuga_ grows 40-45 m tall and sometimes more ([Figure 7.6](#fig-3-7_6), left). It is common on the foreshore, but also occurs in lowland rain forests ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 214-216).

_Intsia bijuga_ is considered one of the strongest and most durable woods in NW Island Melanesia and Vanuatu. It seasons slowly with very little shrinkage and is durable in the ground, resistant to termites and moderately durable in salt water ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 91). Its uses range from house posts and floorboards to axe handles, slitgongs and wooden bowls ([Streicher 1982](Source#cldf:Streicher1982), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989):94, [Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 125, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 122, F. Damon, pers. comm.). Damon reports that on Woodlark Island it was used for the steering oars of the large canoes that plied the eastern half of the Kula ring.

Superficially, it looks as if there were two POc terms for _Intsia bijuga_: _&ast;toRas_ and _&ast;qipil_. However, Blust's gloss of PMP _&ast;teRas_ as 'hard, hardwood' suggests that POc _&ast;toRas_ too may have denoted 'hardwood' in general or a taxon of hardwood trees, rather than _Intsia bijuga_ in particular. This would explain why some of its reflexes denote other hardwood trees. In particular, its Proto Polynesian reflex, _&ast;toa_, was reapplied to _Casuarina equisetifolia_. In Muyuw the term _meikʷ_ is used both for _Intsia bijuga_ and for the hard heartwood of any tree (F. Damon, pers. comm.). Thus one word for hardwood has been replaced by another in naming _Intsia bijuga_.

It seems that PMP _&ast;teRas_ / POc _&ast;toRas_ was, in one of its senses, a stative verb meaning 'hard, durable'. PMic had a stative verb _&ast;ma-toa_ 'be firm, hard strong' ([Bender et al. 2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003): 54), and tree-denoting reflexes sometimes occur with verbal morphology. In CMP languages we find W Sumba, E Sumba _kandora_, E Sumba _mandora_ '_Calophyllum inophyllum_' ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 197), reflecting the PMP stative prefixes _&ast;ka-_ and _&ast;ma-_ respectively ([Evans & Ross 2001](Source#cldf:EvansandRoss2001)).

Polynesian languages, meanwhile, have reapplied the PCP reflex of POc _&ast;pesi_ 'a coastal forest tree, perhaps _Pongamia pinnata_' to _Intsia bijuga_ ([ch.5, §5.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-12#cldf:3-5)).

<a id="p-201"></a>

The inherited meaning of POc _&ast;qipil_ was apparently '_Intsia bijuga_', but the glosses of its reflexes suggest that it also denoted '_Casuarina equisetifolia_'. Note that 'ironwood' and '_kwila_' both refer to '_Intsia bijuga_'.

### 4.10. _Planchonella_ spp., B _komtri_ (Sapotaceae)


_Planchonella_ species range in size from large canopy trees to small trees of the sub-canopy. The species division of the genus _Planchonella_ remains controversial ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 226), partly, it seems, because there is considerable variation within and across species. This is perhaps due to past domestication, but the literature gives little indication of present-day cultivation.[^16] [Borrell](Source#cldf:Borrell1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Borrell1989): 134) identifies six species on Kairiru Island, two of which he is unable to name. There is also an overlap with the genus Pouteria, in the sense that species that have at one time or another been placed in the genus _Planchonella_ have at others been placed in the genus Pouteria. [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 226--227) include _Planchonella grayana_ in their catalogue of fruit trees but say that it is little consumed (because the pulp irritates the gums) except at Tasmate (west Santo), where the mature fruit is either roasted whole or peeled, then washed to remove latex before it is eaten.

[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 429-431) describes _Planchonella peekelii_ (syn. _Sideroxylon peekelii_), a tree about 15m tall with small ovoid fruit, but he does not mention consumption or any other use.

Depending on location, _Planchonella costata_ (syn. Sideroxylon costa tum) varies in the Solomons and Vanuatu between a small sub-canopy tree and a large tree of the canopy. Its bark ranges from pale grey to black-brown, and it has long narrow leaves and round fruit 3-4cm in diameter. It has a preference for the beach or inland for moist habitats. Its wood is close-grained and can be finely worked: combs can be made from a single flat piece of wood ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 113, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 140--141). [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992)) identifies _Planchonella grayana_ as a variety of _Planchonella costata_. [Gowers](Source#cldf:Gowers1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 115) also describes _Planchonella linggensis_, labelled the 'comb tree', leading one to wonder if this also is a variety of _Planchonella costata_.

In view of this variation we can be sure only that POc _&ast;kalaka_ denoted a species of _Planchonella_, and perhaps several. Kairiru _lalak_ may reflect a reduplication of suffixless _&ast;laka_ after deletion of the (apparent) prefix _&ast;ka-_ 'tree' ([ch.2, §7.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-2#cldf:3-2)).

[POc &ast;_kalaka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-4-10-203-POc-kalaka-a)


<a id="p-204"></a>

The glosses in the cognate set below imply that PCP _&ast;bau_ had the meaning which it retains in Wayan Fijian: 'Tree … taxon: generic, includes species of _Burckella_, _Manilkara_, _Palaquium_ and _Planchonella_ (Sapotaceae)' ([Pawley & Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003); see also [ch.3, §3 .1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-3)). They are all medium to large rain forest trees of the family Sapotaceae. I had hesitated to assume that Teop _bau_ '_Leea tetramera_' is cognate, as _Leea tetramera_ is a shrub, but Will Mc-Clatchey (pers. comm.) argues that all the plants listed below except _Guettarda speciosa_ are hardwoods from which a useful club could be made and that this fact is central to the definition of the taxon. This being so, it is possible that POc _&ast;bau_ is identical with POc _&ast;bou_ '_Fagraea_ spp.' ([ch.5, §5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-6#cldf:3-5)).

### 4.11. _Pterocarpus indicus_, New Guinea rosewood, flame wood, B _nananara_, _navilae_, _bluwota_ (Fabaceae)


In the Bismarck Archipelago _Pterocarpus indicus_ grows in lowland rain forests, but in the Solomons it is more salient in freshwater swamp forests ([Figure 7.5](#fig-3-7_5), right). It grows to varying sizes depending on its immediate environment. Sometimes it is an emergent tree up to 40 m high, often it is a large canopy tree, and under some conditions a tree of the lower canopy only 10m high. Like most canopy trees, it has a long bole (which is sometimes crooked) and buttresses which sometimes extend into flutes up the bole ([Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 165, 320).

The flowers are small but bright yellow and fragrant. Its fruit comes in the form of disk-shaped pods. It has red sap, and one of its English names, 'flame wood', reflects the fact that its wood is multi-coloured: yellow, red and brown. Its alternative Bislama name _bluwota_ reflects the fact that the wood and bark turn steel blue when immersed in water ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 145).

_Pterocarpus indicus_ provides excellent timber, moderately soft, moderately light and permanently sweet-smelling. In various parts of the Solomons and Vanuatu the trunks are used for dugout canoes and planks and for carving ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 167, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 145, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 119, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 142). It has similar uses in the Bismarcks, where it is also used for hourglass drums ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)).


<a id="p-205"></a>

In a variety of locations from the Bismarcks to Vanuatu an infusion of the young leaves or of the bark is used against diarrhoea or against excessive menstruation ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 167, [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 92, [Bourdy & Walter 1994](Source#cldf:BourdyandWalter1994)).

Two POc terms for _Pterocarpus indicus_ are reconstructable: _&ast;naRa_ and _&ast;Rigi_.

<a id="s-4-12"></a>

### 4.12. _Vitex cofassus_, New Guinea teak, TP _garamut_ (Lamiaceae)


_Vitex cofassus_ grows 20-40 m tall ([Figure 7.6](#fig-3-7_6), right). It has a grey trunk, with a bole up to 18 m long and buttresses up to 6 m high. The wood is smooth, white and durable ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):480, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)). At least, this is how specimens of _Vitex cofassus_ in the Bismarcks are described. For the Solomons [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 188) describe it as a 'large, ill-formed tree', apparently because its buttresses often extend up the bole as irregular flanges and flutings.


<a id="p-206"></a>

A virtue of the hard wood is that it is not eaten by termites ([Blewett & Blewett n.d.](Source#cldf:BlewettandBlewettnd)). In the Bismarck Archipelago it is used for tool handles, and in both the Bismarcks and the Solomons as timber for wall planking, house posts, canoe paddles and canoes, drums and for carving ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 190, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 150, [Scales n.d.](Source#cldf:Scalesnd)).

The POc term for _Vitex cofassus_ was _&ast;pasa(r,R)_.[^17] [Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1961) ([1961](Source#cldf:Milke1961): 171) reconstructed an unglossed POc _&ast;pasa_ on the basis of the Arosi, Sa'a, Bauan Fijian and Samoan items below, together with Gedaged _safa_ '_Cerbera manghas_'. He assumes that the latter represents a metathesis, but, given the difference between the two species, this is an ad hoc assumption, and the Gedaged item is omitted here.

Riwo and Takia reflect Proto Bel _&ast;payaRi_. The presence of the final consonant and added _-i_ points to a loan. Babatana _vadaka_ is also evidently a loan from an unknown source.

## 5. The lower canopy


Trees of the lower canopy are assumed to be those with a usual height somewhere between 15 m and 20 m. Again some species display significant height variations and, as noted in the subsections below, are canopy trees in some localities. Conversely, of course, some of the trees described in [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-7) as canopy trees grow less well in some places and there belong to the lower canopy.

Certain sub-canopy species are treated in other chapters. The barringtonias _Barringtonia asiatica_, _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ and _Barringtonia procera_ are handled in [ch.5, §5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-5) because of the strong tendency for them to grow on the coast. They are an important part of the lower canopy of the rain forest in parts of Bougainville, however. Other sub-canopy plants, especially in parts of Bougainville and the Solomons, are the betelnut palm, _Areca catechu_ ([ch.13, §2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:3-13)), tree ferns of the genus _Cyathea_ ([ch.10, §3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-10)), fruit trees of the genera _Pandanus_ and _Syzygium_ (ch.ll, [§2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:3-7) and [§3 .7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-7#cldf:3-7)) ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976):64--65, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 60--61).

No reconstruction could be made for any of the species of Celtis, which are lower canopy trees in the Solomons ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 157-158), nor for _Gnetum latifolium_, a large woody climber of Bougainville and the Solomons.


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. _Bischofia javanica_, Java cedar, B _nakoka_, _redwud_ (Phyllanthaceae)


Occurring throughout the Pacific, _Bischofia javanica_ ([Figure 7.7](#fig-3-7_7), left) is often a 30--40 m canopy tree with a bole a metre in diameter in the New Guinea region, but is usually a smaller, sub-canopy tree in Vanuatu. Its wood varies from red with red sap to pink or cream with colourless sap. It has light yellowish green flowers and red or black ovoid fruit half a centimetre in diameter, each with six small seeds ([Johns 1976](Source#cldf:Johns1976):223, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 55).

Its occurrence is evidently very patchy. The fact that names for _Bischofia javanica_ have been collected in NW Island Melanesia from Nakanai, Tolai, Roviana and Lau indicates that this species is also found in the locations of these languages, and this is confirmed by [Conn & Damas](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)), yet [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)), [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988)), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001)) and [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005)) make no mention of it, suggesting that in some places it is far from abundant.

Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) offers an explanation of the distribution of _Bischofia javanica_, commenting that 'It seems to be in places where they traditionally make clothing from felted bark and not in places where the clothing is made from other sorts of materials. It is of course one of the principal dyes for felted Broussonetia.'

The wood is hard and moderately durable and is used in Vanuatu and Tonga for ground posts ([Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 58, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 55)

The PEOc term _&ast;koka_ is reconstructable. The lack of a POc term may simply be due to its absence from a number of sources listing Western Oceanic plant names, i.e. to its odd distribution, rather than to an absence from the environment of POc speakers.

### 5.2. _Cananga odorata_, ylang-ylang, perlume tree, _nandingori_, _nadingro_, _nangungara_ (Annonaceae)


_Cananga odorata_ ([Figure 7.7](#fig-3-7_7), right) is usually a lower canopy tree 10--15 metres tall, but sometimes it reaches the canopy at 30 or 35m ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 183, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

_Cananga odorata_ is known across NW Island Melanesia (and elsewhere) for its fragrant yellow flowers, which are dried and used to scent coconut oil ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):244, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 130).

In northern Vanuatu the trunk is hollowed out and used for making drums and the branches are used for outriggers ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976):43, Jauncey (in progress)). [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 119) and [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 42), on the other hand, say that the wood is too soft to be durable and is useful only for internal construction in places with a smoky atmosphere.

Use of the bark and flowers for medicinal purposes is widespread ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 130).

POc _&ast;(m,mʷ)aso(q)u_ may have denoted a taxon which included _Cananga odorata_ ([§4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-7)). POc _&ast;pʷi(r,R)a_ and PSOc _&ast;diŋori(q)_ both appear to have denoted _Cananga odorata_ alone.

### 5.3. _Cryptocarya_ sp. (Lauraceae)


The genus _Cryptocarya_ consists of laurel-like evergreen plants which range in size from lower canopy shrubs to giant emergent trees ([Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

Among the large trees are _Cryptocarya aromatica_, which was exploited by German traders on the north coast of New Guinea for the essential oil in its bark: see [§4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-7) for discussion. It grows to a height of 45 m and its bole is as much as 1.2 m in diameter. The bark varies in colour, but is often red-brown and corky, with a strong resinous smell. It bears globular berries 10cm in diameter ([Johns 1976](Source#cldf:Johns1976): 65). _Cryptocarya cordata_ is a similarly large tree, and [Record](Source#cldf:Record1945) ([1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)) notes that its currant-sized fruit are used in food as a relish .


<a id="p-210"></a>

The sources of the data supporting POc _&ast;nipus_ '_Cryptocarya_ sp.', [O'Collins & Lamothe](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989)) and [Damon](Source#cldf:Damon2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Damon2004)), do not provide enough information to allow a species identification, but O'Collins and Lamothe mention that the timber is used in house-building on Manus Island, implying that the species is not too small.[^18] The sources of the data supporting PWOc _&ast;ka(m,mʷ)apaR_ tell us that the Muyuw tree is more than 10 m tall, the Patpatar tree, dubbed _Cryptocarya kamahar_ by Peekel, 20--30 m tall.

Damon (In preparation) mentions that the nuts have a rich cinnamon-like smell and are important for medicinal purposes on Woodlark Island. Curiously, Muyuw people do not know the tree, as it grows away from areas they frequent, but they know its nuts because birds swallow them whole, then excrete them in their nests, complete with the endocarp, whence they are collected.

### 5.4. _Dillenia_ sp. (Dilleniaceae)


It was noted in [§4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3#cldf:3-7) that _Dillenia_ species range in size from trees of the lower canopy to tall canopy trees. Although accounts of Bismarcks flora make no mention of the presence of a smaller _Dillenia_ species, there is linguistic evidence that POc speakers knew such a species. Only two Oceanic reflexes have been found, both from Southern Vanuatu, both denoting _Dillenia biflora_, a tree with reddish brown bark that grows to about 15m ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 79). POc _&ast;drokol_ (and PMP _&ast;de(k,g)el_) is reconstructable on the basis of the Southern Vanuatu data and three non-Oceanic cognates, Blit Manobo _(klambug) daka_ '_Dillenia megalantha_'[^19] ([Madulid 2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 100), Sundanese _səgəl_ and Javanese _ḍəgəl_, both '_Dillenia excelsa_' ([Heyne 1950](Source#cldf:Heyne1950): 1071-1072). _Dillenia excelsa_ is also 10--15 min height.

### 5.5. _Diospyros_ spp., ebony, blackwood, B _blakwud_ (Ebenaceae)


_Diospyros_ species are sub-canopy trees around 10 m tall with very hard black wood. _Diospyros peekelii_ is used on New Britain for digging sticks, on New Ireland to make clubs for shark-catching ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 432--433). In the western Solomons the wood of some species is used for carving ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 142). The fruit of _Diospyros_ species is the persimmon. The fruit of some species are edible and are eaten when other food is scarce ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)).

Although _Diospyros_ species are well known sub-canopy trees, widely mentioned in the literature, the only reconstruction that has proven possible is PSOc _&ast;numo_. Otherwise only very local cognate sets are found, raising the possibility that the more important species have been introduced since POc times.

### 5.6. _Euodia_ spp. (Rutaceae)


[Borrell](Source#cldf:Borrell1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Borrell1989): 130--131) finds 14 species of _Euodia_[^21] on Kairiru, ranging from small shrubs a metre high to the medium-sized tree, _Euodia elleryana_ (syn. _Euodia tetragona_, _Melicope elleryana_), 15-20 m tall, with a soft white wood that has an unpleasantly musty smell and masses of rose-pink flowers ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 270).

Peekel reports that larger trunks were used on New Ireland for small outrigger canoe hulls. The wood splits easily and is good for planks ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 104).

Although POc _&ast;bala_ below is supported by only two reflexes, the notes provided by [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 158) are informative. Kwara'ae _bala_ is a generic term for species which include _bala ni kwaru_ [bala of rock] '_Euodia elleryana_', _bala kwau_ (lit. 'white _Euodia_' ) or _bala fufuri_ (lit. 'patchy _Euodia_'), and simply _bala_. The authors provide a scientific name only for the first of the three. Apparently excluded from the bala taxon is _Euodia hortensis_, Kwara'ae _foʔoka_ or _foʔaka_, which has complex ritual uses both here and at other localities. It is possible that POc _&ast;bala_ also denoted a taxon of _Euodia_ species, the more so as Motu _ebala_ denotes _Euodia hortensis_, the one species that Kwara'ae _bala_ excludes.


<a id="p-212"></a>

[POc &ast;_bala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-5-6-212-POc-bala-a)

A reasonable (but not the only) interpretation of the data below is that POc _&ast;bosi_ denoted a forest tree with white wood, perhaps _Euodia elleryana_, as the Meso-Melanesian data suggest, and was reapplied to another tree with white wood, _Alphitonia zizyphoides_, in southern Vanuatu.

[POc &ast;_bosi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-5-6-212-POc-bosi-a)

Despite the fact that the shrub _Euodia hortensis_ (island musk) is often cultivated and occurs in varieties with acrid-smelling leaves of various shapes, green or yellow, which are used to keep flies away and employed for various medicinal and ritual purposes at many localities ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):362, [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 267-268, [Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 133, [Whistler 2000](Source#cldf:Whistler2000): 119, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 91, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 106; [ch.9, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-9)), the only term reconstructed for _Euodia hortensis_ is PCP _&ast;usi_.

### 5.7. _Kleinhovia hospita_, puzzle tree, guest tree, B _namatal_ (Sterculiaceae)


_Kleinhovia hospita_ is a small to medium-sized tree. In New Ireland it usually grows to 6-10 m tall, but is sometimes as tall as 20-30 m in primary forest ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 373). A striking feature is its short, branching bole: 'it sprouts into many trees' in the words of [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 135).


<a id="p-213"></a>

There is remarkable agreement across sources about its uses, which do not vary much from the Bismarck Archipelago to Vanuatu. Its bast (fibrous inner bark) serves as temporary binding material. The soft light timber provided by young straight branches is used for rafters and internal construction. It also provides excellent firewood, and trees are sometimes ringbarked to turn them into convenient fuel sources. It is reputed to be one of the best woods for starting fires by traditional friction methods (another is the small forest tree _Callicarpa pentandra_ according to Kwara'ae lore) ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 158-159, [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 94, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 225, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 135, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 115-116).

Fewer sources mention medicinal uses: the Bola of New Britain use an infusion of the bark, and the leaves are used medicinally in Vanuatu ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 225).

[__Figure 7.9:__ _Kleinhovia hospita_: __A__, tree; __B__, shoot with a mature and an old inflorescence; __C__, leaf.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-7_9)



Most of the terms below are from NCV languages, and they present a minor puzzle. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)) divides them into two groups and makes two resemblant but seemingly irreconcilable PNCV reconstructions, _&ast;ma(t,d)aka_ (Banks, Malakula, Epi) and _&ast;matala_ (Banks, Santo, Malakula, Paama, Efate). There are also MM and SES reflexes, however, and here the terms reflect POc _&ast;ma(i)tagaR(a)_. Lynch's PNCV _&ast;ma(t,d)aka_, modified here to _&ast;ma(t,d)aga_, reflects this unproblematically. This leaves Lynch's PNCV _&ast;matala_, which I take to reflect an early borrowing from a language which had lost _&ast;-k-_ but retained _&ast;-R-_ as _-l-_ (the SES languages of Malaita reflect this pattern of reflexes, but there is no good reason to suppose that a language descended from the borrowing source still exists).

PMM _&ast;p(i,u)lakis_ and POc _&ast;paqu_, both '_Kleinhovia hospita_', are also reconstructable. The forms under 'cf also' appear to reflect a variant _&ast;paqi_ which may represent a conflation of the two etyma.

### 5.8. _Litsea_ spp. (Lauraceae)


Numerous _Litsea_ species of varying statures occur in the Bismarcks and the Solomons. If POc _&ast;lowaŋa_, reconstructed below, did indeed denote a particular species of _Litsea_, then [O'Collins & Lamothe](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989)) indicate that it was one large enough to make a canoe hull. Of the species listed by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 191), two qualify: _Litsea kauloensis_ and _Litsea dielsiana_, each 15-20 m tall.

The reconstruction of PCEMP/POc _&ast;lowaŋa_ '_Litsea_ sp.' is made possible by the CMP reflexes recorded by [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 224): Kepo, Rembong (both CMP) _lowaŋ_ '_Litsea_ sp.'. Although Nakanai _loaga_ '_Gmelina_ sp.' is glossed as another species, both are used for canoe hulls, and the Nakanai term is almost certainly cognate with Nyindrou _lowaŋ_. Nakanai also provides us with the final vowel for the reconstruction; that there was a final vowel can be inferred from the fact that final consonants are lost in Nyindrou and in the CMP languages from which reflexes are drawn.

### 5.9. _Myristica_ spp., wild nutmeg, B _nandae_ (Myristicaceae)


The most famous _Myristica_ species is the nutmeg, but its easternmost extent is West Papua ([Warburg 1899](Source#cldf:Warburg1899): 57). Among the species of wild nutmeg which grow in the Bismarcks are _Myristica schleinitzii_, a small foreshore tree 3-6 m tall, and _Myristica fatua_, a sub-canopy tree reaching 20m on New Ireland ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 185). _Myristica fatua_ is a canopy tree in some areas, e.g. in Kwara'ae country. Both species prefer a damp environment and have stilt roots even in dry locations ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 37). POc _&ast;(dr,d)aRa(q,k)a_ presumably denoted at least one of these two species and perhaps a taxon including a number of _Myristica_ species.

The soft wood of both species makes planking for indoor use and good firewood in locations from New Britain to Vanuatu ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):172-174, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 120, 167).

With regard to reconstructing a PROc term for _Myristica fatua_ [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)) writes:

> The Banks and Raga forms suggest _&ast;draRaka_, other NCV languages something like _&ast;draRaqi_, while the SV forms point rather to PSOc _&ast;d(r)ani_, _&ast;d(r)aRani_ or _&ast;d(r)aqani_. Ross Clark (pers. comm.) has suggested a possible connection to words meaning 'blood', from POc _&ast;draRaq_: [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 172) refers to the 'dark red exudate' of the inner bark, and Codrington relates Mota _naraa_ to _nara_ 'blood'. The S Efate form is also homophonous with 'blood', and the SV forms almost so (PSV _&ast;n-da(q,V)_, _&ast;n-da(a)-_). The form may thus be based on the POc term for 'blood' [&ast;draRaq], and be something like _&ast;draRaq-(n)(i,a)_.

To Lynch's Southern Oceanic cognate set we add Western Oceanic and Kwara'ae (SES) items. Reconstructing a POc etymon from these data is tricky, as they do not lead to an unambiguous reconstruction, yet they probably all reflect a single etymon.

Lynch' s discussion points to three phonological questions:

- the third consonant: was it POc _&ast;k_ or _&ast;q_?
- the third vowel: was it POc _&ast;a_ or _&ast;i_?
- what is the source of PSV _&ast;n_?


<a id="p-216"></a>

To these we can add a fourth not raised by Lynch's data:

- the initial consonant: was it POc _&ast;dr_ or _&ast;d_?

I address the last question first. All reflexes except Muyuw, Lihir and Kwara'ae point to either _&ast;dr-_ or _&ast;d-_. Muyuw _a-yayak_ and Lihir _lala_, however, reflect initial POc _&ast;r-_ or _&ast;R-_. These probably reflect assimilation to the medial reflex of _&ast;-R-_, so they do not help us to disambiguate the initial. Distinguishing reflexes of _&ast;d_ from those of _&ast;dr_ is difficult, because _&ast;d_ was a very low-frequency POc consonant: for some languages we have no reflex of _&ast;d_, and in some others it merges with _&ast;dr_. The one language that helps us with this disambiguation is Kwara'ae, where _ka-kalaʔa_ at first sight seems to reflect POc _&ast;g-_. However, a small number of SE Solomonic lexical items reflect POc _&ast;d_ (but apparently not _&ast;dr_) as if it were _&ast;g_, and this is evidently one of them. This suggests that the initial consonant was _&ast;d-_ and that resemblances to the word for 'blood' are accidental, but perhaps amplified by folk-etymologising, since the blood-like colour of _Myristica_ sap is widely recognised.[^22]

The second question to be addressed concerns the third consonant: was it POc _&ast;k_ or _&ast;q_? As Lynch notes, the Banks and Raga reflexes (the first six NCV reflexes below) point to _&ast;k_. So does Muyuw _a-yayak_. Other reflexes point to _&ast;q_. If changes in form took place as a result of folk-etymologising, then reflexes of _&ast;q_ may be due to reflexes of POc _&ast;draRaq_ 'blood', leaving _&ast;k_ as the more likely proto-consonant.

The other two questions-was the third vowel _&ast;a_ or _&ast;i_? what is the source of PSV _&ast;n_? - may be taken together. Four items below, Kwara'ae _ka-kalaʔa_, Vera'a _daraɣa_, Mota _na-raɣa_ and Raga _a-oaɣa_ suggest that the vowel was _&ast;a_, i.e. they point to POc _&ast;(dr,d)aRaka_. On the other hand NE Ambae _dadai_ and Uripiv _drari_ reflect a final _&ast;-i_ in _&ast;(dr,d)aRaq(a)-i_, and PSV _&ast;na-(dr,d )ani_ reflects a final _&ast;-ni_ in _&ast;(dr,d )aRaq(a)-ni_ (these are languages in which both _&ast;R_ and _&ast;q_ are lost). The altemation between final _&ast;-i_ and _&ast;-ni_ is suggestive, as both are reflected in variants of the so-called associative: (non-specific possessor) construction. Thus 'blood of tree' would have been expressed in POc as _&ast;(dr,d)aRaq i kayu_ or _&ast;(dr,d)aRaq ni kayu_, depending on whether _&ast;(dr,d)aRaq_ was directly or indirectly possessed; either _&ast;i_ or _&ast;ni_ has been generalised to both in various daughter-languages ([Ross 1998b](Source#cldf:Ross1998b)). The suggestion is that _&ast;-i- and _&ast;-ni_ are accretions brought about by the truncation of something like 'blood of tree', itself an outcome of folk etymology, and that they are therefore not part of the POc reconstruction.

The reconstruction that emerges from the discussion above is POc _&ast;daRaka_, but there is enough speculation above to commend prudence, and so I offer POc _&ast;(dr,d)aRa(q,k)a_ below.

### 5.10. _Parinari_ spp., putty nut (Chrysobalanaoeae)


Finding one's way through the maze of synonymous scientific names for Bismarcks species of the genus _Parinari_ is difficult, but it appears that in NW Island Melanesia there are two similar species which were perhaps treated as a single POc taxon, _&ast;(q,k)atita_:[^23]

- _Parinari laurina_ (syn. Cyclandrophora laurina, _Atuna racemosa_) and
- _Parinari glaberrima_ (syn. _Maranthes corymbosa_, _Parinari corymbosa_, _Parinari griffithiana_) ([Figure 7.10](#fig-3-7_10), left)[^24]

_Parinari laurina_ seems to be more common in the Bismarcks, _Parinari glaberrima_ in the Solomons. Both are small to medium-sized sub-canopy trees, 10--20 m tall. Their large nuts have a hard shell. After it has been broken, the tough kernel of the fruit is rubbed over a rough surface to produce small crumbs of putty-like mash, and the resulting sticky putty is used to caulk plank canoes, to seal and repair cracks in dugouts, and to fasten shell inlays to wood carvings. After drying, this coating forms a firm, watertight and breakable-resistant layer ([Holdsworth & Wamoi 1981](Source#cldf:HoldsworthandWamoi1981), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):202-203, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):230-232, [Ohnemus 1998](Source#cldf:Ohnemus1998), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 165, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 147).

In the Carolines a decoction of the pericarp of the _Parinari laurina_ fruit is used for painting canoes red ([Christian 1899](Source#cldf:Christian1899): 328). In Fiji its long straight branches are used for canoe paddles and as houses rafters. Its leaves are used to fill in the outer walls of houses ([Capell 1941](Source#cldf:Capell1941)). In the Solomons the bark provides a medicine taken against diarrhoea or dysentery ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 232).

Reconstructing the POc term for the putty nut is a little tricky, as [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Chowning2001): 76) mentions in a footnote, because Oceanic languages appear to reflect three related forms: _&ast;qatita_, _&ast;katita_ and _&ast;tita_. The Admiralties forms below may reflect either POc _&ast;katita_ or

POc _&ast;qatita_. Of the Western Oceanic forms, Wogeo _kətita_ and Kara _katita_ reflect _&ast;katita_, whilst the rest may reflect either _&ast;katita_ or _&ast;qatita_. On the simplest interpretation of the data I reconstruct PWOc _&ast;katita_. The Eastern Oceanic forms, on the other hand, reflect _&ast;qatita_. POc _&ast;(q,k)atita_ below reflects this ambiguity.

Blust (ACD) reconstructs doublets _&ast;qatita_ and _&ast;qarita_ for this item. Supporting data for medial _&ast;-r-_, however, are drawn entirely from Admiralties languages and Mussau, a distribution which does not justify a POc reconstruction on the criteria set out in [ch. 1, §3.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2-3#cldf:3-1). Instead, it seems likely that the forms listed below which appear to reflect _&ast;qarita_ are the result of borrowing(s) from a language or languages that reflects (or reflected) POc _&ast;-t-_ as _-r-_. There are a number of these in the Admiral1cies: Lou, Penchal, Baluan, Lenkau, Pak, Koro, Nali, Lele and Ponam ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988): 322) (among the data above only Lou has _-r-_ in a directly inherited reflex of _&ast;qatita_).

Among directly inherited Admiralties reflexes of _&ast;qatita_, those in Likum, Drehet and Lou have initial _k-_. The reflexes below, however, agree not only in appearing to reflect _&ast;-r-_ but also in loss of the initial consonant. This suggests that they may all reflect a single early borrowing of a form _&ast;arita_.

[3-7-5-10-219-adm-mussau-arita](cf.csv#cldf:3-7-5-10-219-adm-mussau-arita)

A number of Meso-Melanesian reflexes lack the initial syllable, reflecting a possible PMM altemant _&ast;tita_.[^25] For clarity's sake these are listed separately below. There are also two SE Solomonic reflexes of _&ast;tita_, in Gela and Bugotu, but both languages are prone to borrow from NW Solomonic (and thus Meso-Melanesian) neighbours.

Attempting to account for _&ast;tita_ Blust (ACD) suggests that the initial syllable has been irregularly lost. He puts forward two possible reasons for such a loss. First, POc roots were predominantly disyllabic, and this is true of many daughter-languages: this might favour foreshortening. Second, the POc common article was _&ast;a_ or _&ast;na_. If initial _&ast;k-_ or _&ast;q-_ was lost from a reflex, then the resulting initial _&ast;a-_ could be reanalysed as part of the article. A third possible reason is offered here, namely that _&ast;ka-_ was reanalysed as the 'tree' prefix _&ast;ka-_, leaving _&ast;tita_ as the name of the tree ([ch.2, §7.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-2#cldf:3-2)).

[PMM &ast;_tita_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-5-10-220-PMM-tita-a)

The cognate set below appears at first sight to be related to Baegu, Kwara'ae, Sa'a and Lau _saia_ above, but _saia_ is the regular reflex of POc _&ast;qatita_, since _&ast;q-_ and _&ast;-t-_ are both deleted, and _s-_ is a regular accretion before the resulting initial _a-_, corresponding with Kwaio _l-_ in _laia_ and 'Are'are _r-_ in _raia_ (Frantisek [Lichtenberk 1988](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1988)). These changes are quite different from those regularly reflected in PCP.

### 5.11. Palms



<a id="s-5-11-1"></a>

#### 5.11.1. _Caryota rumphiana_, black palm, fishtail palm, TP _waillimbum_ (Arecaceae)


_Caryota rumphiana_ is the only palm in NW Island Melanesia with bipinnate fronds, i.e. the leaflets on either side of the midrib themselves have a central rib and are leaf-like ([Figure 7.10](#fig-3-7_10), right). _Caryota rumphiana_ stands 10--20 m high and has fruit the size of a cherry which hang in bunches from the top of its blackish trunk ([Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 187).

Throughout NW Island Melanesia, the trunks are split to make floorboards ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 150, [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 93, [Scales n.d.](Source#cldf:Scalesnd) [McEldowney 1995](Source#cldf:Mceldowney1995), [Margetts 2005a](Source#cldf:Margetts2005a)). The wood is also used on New Britain for axe handles, clubs, bows and spears ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)). The pith from the young trunk is sometimes eaten on New Britain, and fed to pigs in the Solomons.

[Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 150) describe how inland dwellers in the Solomons use a felled _Caryota rumphiana_ trunk to farm larvae of a large beetle of the genus Rhynocaphorus by cutting notches at 2 m intervals along it, harvesting the larvae and pupae 3--4 months later. For some households the larvae are a major source of protein, although others find the accompanying taste of the rotting palm core rather offensive.

The Oceanic data below were assembled by Blust (ACD). The reconstruction of PCEMP _&ast;bual(a)_ '_Caryota_ sp.' is based on these data and on W Sumba _ʔwuola_, E Sumba (both CMP) _ʔwuala_ '_Caryota mitis_' ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 199).

<a id="s-5-11-2"></a>

#### 5.11.2. _Licuala_ spp., fan palm (Arecaceae)


The leaves of the small palm _Licuala ramsayi_ (syn. _L. muelleri_, _L. peekelii_), growing to about 5-10 m, serve for roofing in parts of the Bismarcks ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 58). The Nakanai use them to wrap megapode eggs (A. Chowning, pers. comm.). The palm also serves decorative purposes: in the Ninigo Islands it is planted as an ornamental shrub ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950)), and various writers note that its leaves are used for personal decoration.

POc _&ast;piRu_ denoted one or more _Licuala_ species, a fan palm. As [French-Wright](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983): 208-209) and [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Chowning2001): 84) note, in Fijian and the Polynesian languages its reflexes denote the fan palm _Pritchardia pacifica_, found only in Fiji and Polynesia.[^26] This is an instance of an established name being given to a new-found species as Oceanic speakers moved eastward.

On the basis of the non-Oceanic data supporting Blust's reconstruction of PMP _&ast;biRuʔ_ (ACD), we would expect the POc form _&ast;piRu_, and this is reflected everywhere except in northern Vanuatu, where a local form _&ast;piloqi_ is reflected. NCV forms sporadically retain a POc final consonant with an added _&ast;-i_, regularly lost in Volow, Mota and Merlav, and so the final _-ɣ_ of these items may reflect POc _&ast;-q_, a possibility recognised in the reconstruction of POc _&ast;piRu(q)_.

## 6. The shrub layer


The shrub layer is usually patchy because of lack of sunlight. A few small trees, up to a height of around 15m, grow here, as well as _Calamus_ ([§6.3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-1#cldf:3-7)), bamboos ([ch.13, §3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-13)) and gingers ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 320).


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Woody shrubs



<a id="s-6-1-1"></a>

#### 6.1.1. _Abroma augusta_ (Sterculiaceae)


_Abroma augusta_ is a small shrub 1-2m tall, more common in the highlands of New Guinea than in lowland forests ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 373). On Malaita its white bark is used to make hanging baskets ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 160). In parts of New Britain its bast provides rope for pig nets and for lashing house components and material used in making clothing, and bags ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Lentfer 2003](Source#cldf:Lentfer2003)).

Reflexes of POc _&ast;wasi-wasi_ '_Abroma augusta_' are found with this meaning only in Near Oceania. In Remote Oceania the name denotes a large forest tree, _Sterculia vitiensis_ ([ch. 11, §2.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-6#cldf:3-11)), which does not occur in NW Island Melanesia. Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) suggests that the change in denotation was mediated by the fact that _Sterculia vitiensis_ is also a source of fibre.

#### 6.1.2. _Angiopteris evecta_ (syn. _Angiopteris erecta_), mule's foot fern (Marattiaceae)


The plant with the largest fronds (1.5m long) on New Ireland, _Angiopteris evecta_ is a large fern common in shady inland forest. The fronds rise from a massive rootstock, fleshy and moist, but fragrant when dry ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 30). Because of their moisture, the Kwara'ae lay them out around garden boundaries to soften the soil in the belief that this will improve the quality of the taro ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 211).

#### 6.1.3. _Donax cannaeformis_ (syn. _Clinogyne grandis_, _Maranta grandis_, _Thalia cannaeformis_, _Actoplanes canniformis_, _Donax arundastrum_) (Marantaceae)


A leafy shrub, _Donax cannaeformis_ has a rhizome from which rise erect smooth stems 1.5-3 m tall with spreading branches about 85cm long. It has elliptical leaves often with yellowish-white patches and white flowers and fruits, and grows in damp locations ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 111). Its range is from SE Asia to the Solomons.

As the glosses below indicate, its stems are used in thatching, basket-making and as armlets.

#### 6.1.4. _Garcinia_ spp. (Clusiaceae)


_Garcinia_ species grow in all sizes from small shrubs to tall canopy trees. The best known species is _G. mangostana_, the mangosteen, which grows up to 25 m high, but this is not indigenous to Oceania. The only indigenous species reported by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 376-377) in the Bismarcks is _Garcinia novo-guineensis_ (syn. _Garcinia warburgiana_), a tree just 5-10 m tall with small white flowers. It contains, especially in the roots, yellow latex which is used on New Ireland for painting ancestor pictures. This yellow is greenish and lighter than that from Curcuma ([ch.13, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:3-13)).

Another species found in NW Island Melanesia is _Garcinia pseudoguttifera_ (syn. _Garcinia pancheri_), a tree up to 25m high ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 112). It is not found in the Bismarcks but occurs from Bougainville to Tonga. It has edible fruit and displays the considerable variation that reflects former cultivation ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002)). Taller _Garcinia_ species appear to play a greater role in the rain forests of Bougainville than of the Bismarcks ([Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 61).

Wood from an unnamed _Garcinia_ species is used for axe handles on New Britain and for rafters both there and in the Admiralties ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989), [O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989)).

Very little information is available to help us determine the denotata of the species below, but it is a reasonable inference that POc _&ast;bulu_ denoted the small _Garcinia novo-guineensis_, as this is present in the Bismarcks (and is the gloss of the Motu reflex).

[POc &ast;_bulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-6-1-225-POc-bulu-a)


<a id="p-226"></a>

The denotatum of PWOc _&ast;tabun_ was probably a large canopy tree. Muyuw _tob_ is a large canopy tree with stilt roots, an apt description of _Garcinia latissima_ ([Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)). Tolai _tabu-tabun_ is glossed _Garcinia scaphopetala_, which grows to 30 m.[^29]

[PWOc &ast;_tabun_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-7-6-1-226-PWOc-tabun-a)

The tree designated by PSV _&ast;n-mobʷol_ was evidently also a large species, as _Garcinia sessilis_ and _Garcinia platyphylla_ are both canopy trees.

#### 6.1.5. _Phaleria_ spp. (Thymelaeaceae)


[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 393) describes _Phaleria coccinea_ as a climbing shrub, 2-4m high, with white flowers and red berries. No term is reconstructable earlier than PEOc _&ast;sinu_, glossed 'shore tree with scented white flowers' by [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983)). The Bauan gloss points to a taxon of shrubs whose sap causes irritation, including species of _Phaleria_, an inference supported by the Tongan and Samoan glosses.

If the NW Solomonic items under 'cf. also', all glossed _Cominsia gigantea_ (Marantaceae) (a leafy shrub), are cognate, then POc _&ast;jinu_ is reconstructable but with uncertain denotation.

<a id="s-6-1-6"></a>

#### 6.1.6. _Semecarpus forstenii_, poisonwood, B _naolasi_, _posentri_, _posenwud_ (Anacardiaceae)


_Semecarpus forstenii_ is a shrub or small tree 3-10m tall, with a corrosive black sap which destroys skin and inflicts painful wounds. Peekel calls it '[t]he most feared tree in the Bismarck Archipelago' ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 328, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 121-122).

_Semecarpus vitiensis_ (syn. _S. laxiflora_) is a medium-sized tree up to 25 m in height, but it has a black sap with similar effects to that of S.forstenii ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 38).

The distribution of the two species seems to be complementary: _Semecarpus forstenii_ in the Bismarcks and the Solomons and the larger _Semecarpus vitiensis_ in Vanuatu and Fiji.[^30] For this reason I infer that POc _&ast;walasi_ denoted _Semecarpus forstenii_. POc _&ast;lasi_ is listed by [Tryon](Source#cldf:Tryon1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Tryon1994)) as '_Antiaris toxicaria_', a gloss maintained by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f) ([2002f](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f)), but this seems incorrect in view of the reflexes listed here.[^31]

The presence of _-i-_ in Kwaio and Kwara'ae _kʷailasi_ and Lau _koilasi_ probably reflects a folk etymology which interprets the first syllable as _kʷai_ 'river, water' (< POc _&ast;waiR_), but there is no other evidence to suggest that this is the origin of POc initial _&ast;wa-_. Indeed, it is possible that this folk etymologising accounts for the loss of _&ast;wa-_ in a number of reflexes.

### 6.2. Leafy shrubs


The only wild leafy shrub for which a reconstruction has been made is _Hornstedtia lycostoma_. The genera Alpinia and _Heliconia_ also belong here, but no reconstruction of a name for an Alpinia species is supported by the data. _Heliconias_ are also cultivated, and are treated in [ch.13, §6.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-5#cldf:3-13).


<a id="s-6-2-1"></a>

#### 6.2.1. _Hornstedtia lycostoma_ (syn. _Hornstedtia scottiana_) (Zingiberaceae)


_Hornstedtia lycostoma_ is a leafy shrub, 3-6m tall, a tall wild ginger with long leaves and red flowers that issue directly from the stem ([Figure 7.11](#fig-3-7_11), left). The edible seeds are sweet and are gathered especially by children who sometimes eat so many that they become constipated ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 105-106, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 195 [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 110).

<a id="s-6-3-1"></a>

#### 6.3.1. _Calamus_ spp., rattan, lawyer cane, TP _kanda_, P _loeaken_ (Arecaceae)


There is a sense in which rattan could be assigned to the canopy, as it uses canopy trees as hosts and sometimes climbs as high as 50 m. At the same time, it is not a tree and it is convenient to treat it alongside other non-treelike plants.

[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 61) describes two very similar species of rattan, _Calamus hollrungii_ ([Figure 7.11](#fig-3-7_11), right) and _Calamus ralumensis_. They are spiny climbing palms from the vines of which curved thorns protrude to attach it to the host. _Calamus hollrungii_ is recorded throughout NW Island Melanesia, whereas _Calamus ralumensis_ is reported only by Peekel and only on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain. This raises the possibility that it is identical with _Calamus stipitatus_, which occurs throughout the Solomons and is described as similar to _Calamus hollrungii_ but having longer, narrower leaflets and a somewhat thinner vine ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):208-211, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 134, 147). Rattan appears not to have been present in Remote Oceania until recently.

Reports from the north coast of New Britain say that pieces of rattan are used for arrowheads, for the binding on arrows, for adzes, for bowstrings and bow bracers, in boats for lashings, bindings and braces and for the anchor cable, in houses for tying and plaiting, and for personal adornment as armbands and armlets, belts, necklaces and headbands ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)). A similar range of uses of the cane is reported elsewhere. Hviding reports that split lengths of _Calamus stipitatus_ are used for sewing roofs and sewing sago-leaf panels in house construction. Unsplit lengths make ropes for heavy tasks like pulling a dugout canoe from its construction site down to the beach. _Calamus hollrungii_ has similar uses, according to [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 205). Hviding mentions that it is used to make tongs to pull items from the hot stone oven. Other parts of the plant are also used. The Bola make wall insulation from the leaves, sometimes eat the young shoots, and use the sap for various medicinal purposes. At Kwara'ae the thorns are used as tattooing needles.

POc _&ast;qu(w)e_[^33] presumably denoted all of the two or three species mentioned above.

#### 6.3.2. _Dendrocnide_ and _Laportea_ spp., nettle trees, TP _salat_, _filas_, B _nanggalat_ (Urticaceae)


_Dendrocnide_ and _Laportea_ species are nettles, i.e. plants with stinging hairs, often grouped together in the literature as 'nettles' or 'nettle trees'. The hairs remain in the skin, enabling the toxin in them to spread. Those mentioned below range from the 40-metre canopy tree _Dendrocnide excelsa_ to the small stinging herb _Laportea interrupta_. They are included here as shrubs simply because this is where a majority of their tokens belong.

Until 1965 the members of both genera were considered to belong to the genus _Laportea_, but, as a footnote by the translator, E.E. Henty in [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 151) explains, the genus _Laportea_ was revised by [Chew](Source#cldf:Chew1965) ([1965](Source#cldf:Chew1965)), removing woody species from it and placing them in a new genus _Dendrocnide_. At the same time the genus Fleurya was abandoned and its species transferred to _Laportea_. _Laportea_ are monoecious herbs whilst _Dendrocnide_ are dioecious shrubs or trees.[^34] In both genera the fruit is dry and has a single seed.

Species of _Laportea_ and _Dendrocnide_ are often not distinguished by the glosses in the cognate sets below, but this at least in part reflects the usage of the terms. [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 240) reports that in Vanuatu languages generally there is a single term for all _Dendrocnide_ species, despite the fact that in Vanuatu they vary in size from the shrubby _Dendrocnide latifolia_, which occasionally grows to 10 m but is usually smaller, to the 25 m canopy tree _Dendrocnide moroides_.

_Dendrocnide_ species are much better described in the literature than _Laportea_ species, presumably because the latter are simply regarded as nuisance weeds. Species mentioned in the glosses below are, roughly from largest to smallest:

- _Dendrocnide excelsa_ (syn. _L. gigas_), the giant stinging tree, is a tree of the forest canopy, up to
  40 m tall, with dull green heart-shaped or round leaves covered with stinging hairs.[^35]
- _Dendrocnide harveyi_ (syn. _Dendrocnide milnei_, _Laportea harveyi_, _L. milnei_), a tree up to 20m tall, apparently found
  only in Fiji and western Polynesia.
- _Dendrocnide latifolia_, a small shrubby tree, occasionally with a straight bole and reaching 10 m,
  but usually smaller. It is common in secondary forest. It has a serious sting, the pain of
  which lasts for days ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):238, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 154, [Scales n.d.](Source#cldf:Scalesnd)).
- _Dendrocnide sessiliflora_ (syn. _Laportea sessiliflora_), a shrub or small tree 3-10 m high with a mild sting

- _Laportea interrupta_ (syn. Fleurya interrupta, Urtica interrupta) resembles a small European
  stinging nettle with a serious sting, and is cultivated and eaten by the Tolai of the
  Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 157).

Apparently none of the trees is used for timber, but Ann Chowning (pers. comm.) reports that on New Britain Nakanai and Meramera speakers dry _Laportea_ bark over a fire and use it for roofs and walls. [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 240) comments that _Dendrocnide moroides_ (syn. _Laportea moroides_), a canopy tree of 25 m found in central Vanuatu, is considered useless because the wood is very soft and rots quickly. The leaves and bark of a number of species have medicinal uses. The leaves of a _Dendrocnide_ species were used medicinally on Manam Island. They were boiled in water or with grated coconut to cure constipation or general seediness ([Wedgwood 1934](Source#cldf:Wedgwood1934): 286--287). [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 151) notes that the finely chopped leaves of _Dendrocnide longifolia_ (a shrub or small tree, 3-5m high) were mixed in to dogs' food to make them hunt more keenly. _Dendrocnide latifolia_ was used in much the same way on Mwotlap, except that here the recipients were warriors: they were given a soup made from the leaves to render them quicker tempered and stronger in battle ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 238).

Several forms below reflect PAn _&ast;lateŋ_ with a prefixed syllable: POc _&ast;ja-latoŋ_, PAdm _&ast;la-latoŋ_, _&ast;ña-latoŋ_, PNCV _&ast;ga-latoŋ_. The existence of the various prefixed forms indicates that unprefixed _&ast;latoŋ_ was also inherited into POc, and this is borne out by a single unprefixed reflex below: Kove _lato_. POc _&ast;jalatoŋ_, the most widely reflected form, must also have been inherited, as non-Oceanic reflexes occur. Apart from a few languages in the extreme north of Vanuatu - Vures, Mwesen, Dorig, Merlav - which reflect the prefix _&ast;ja-_ regularly ([François 2004b](Source#cldf:Francois2004b)), most known reflexes in Vanuatu, listed separately below, reflect _&ast;ga-_ 'tree'.

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) plausibly suggests that PNCV _&ast;kara_ reflects POc _&ast;kaRat_ 'bite', and the final _-t_ of Big Nambas _n-harat_ appears to support this etymology.

#### 6.3.3. _Lygodium_ spp. (Lygodiaceae)


Ferns of the genus _Lygodium_ are climbing vines which wind around tree trunks. [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 27, 30) writes that _Lygodium circinnatum_ (syn. _L. dichotomum_, _Lygodium flexuosum_) grows 3-6m long, _Lygodium trifurcatum_, more delicate than _Lygodium circinnatum_, grows 3-5m high, and _Lygodium scandens_ (syn. _L. microphyllum_) 1-3m long.

All are apparently used as binding material. The thicker _Lygodium circinnatum_ and, among the Roviana, _Lygodium trifurcatum_ are used for binding outrigger booms. The more delicate _Lygodium scandens_ is used in weaving, for tying bundles and as circlets for the arm or leg ([Waterhouse 1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 93).

#### 6.3.4. _Merremia_ spp. (Convolvulaceae)


_Merremia peltata_ (syn. _Operculina peltata_, Convulvulus peltatus, _Ipomoea peltata_) is a woody liana found throughout the rain forest, but it is particularly abundant in disturbed forest areas. The vine has the thickness of a human arm and grows 15-50 m high, with white-yellowish funnel-shaped flowers that resemble Morning Glory ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):467, [Pawley & Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003), W. McClatchey, pers. comm.).

According to Peekel _Merremia peltata_ vines are used as binding material in circumstances where the fastening does not need to be durable. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 124) reports from Marovo that older thicker vines contain a milky sap that is good for stopping blood flow in an emergency.

The Meso-Melanesian forms below other than Tolai _valearu_ reflect POc _&ast;paliaRa_, but reflexes of _&ast;paliaRua_ are found in New Ireland, southern Vanuatu and Fiji, and I take this to have been the POc form.

#### 6.3.5. _Asplenium nidus_, bird's nest fern (Aspleniaceae)


The bird's nest fern, _Asplenium nidus_, usually grows as an epiphyte on the trunks or branches of trees in the rain forest or mangrove swamp. It has large simple fronds visually similar to banana leaves, growing to 50-150cm long and 10--20cm broad. The fronds are light green, often crinkled, with a black midrib. The fronds grow in clusters and roll back as they turn brown, creating a massive leaf nest where they are attached to the tree. It is an ideal understorey plant, as it thrives in warm, humid habitats in partial or full shade ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 17, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 124).

The POc term was _&ast;pʷete_.

## 7. The forest floor


Because it receives little light, the forest floor is often almost bare of plants that depend for their existence on photosynthesis. The lower parts of trees and the debris of fallen trunks and branches, however, provide a home for fungi of various kinds.

The generic term for mushrooms and fleshy fungi was POc _&ast;taliŋa_ ([Ch 3, §4. 7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-7#cldf:3-3)), formally identical to _&ast;taliŋa_ 'ear' and presumably reflecting a perception that some fungi resemble the human ear. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:Blust2000)) points out that more detailed descriptions specify the referent of _&ast;taliŋa_ reflexes as jelly fungus, which do not have the umbrella-like shape of a mushroom but 'sprout directly from the trunks of dead trees as a collection of folded tissues which may appear cup-like or ear-like'. Their names include reference to 'ear' in a number of cultures around the world. In Austronesian languages, including some in Oceania, the name also specifies the ear's owner. Since they grow on tree bark, they are sometimes named 'tree ear'. Whether one should therefore reconstruct POc _&ast;taliŋa qi kayu_ 'tree fungus' (lit. 'ear of tree') is a little debatable. This may well have been a POc locution, as Blust also notes its occurrence in non-Oceanic Austronesian languages, but it may also have been coined more than once in the history of Austronesian languages. Most of the terms below are from [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:Blust2000)).

[3-7-7-None-235-adm-mondropolon-cannikei](cf.csv#cldf:3-7-7-None-235-adm-mondropolon-cannikei)

Some jelly fungi are named 'rat ear', apparently because of their shape:

[3-7-7-None-235-ncv-paamese-ralienasu](cf.csv#cldf:3-7-7-None-235-ncv-paamese-ralienasu)

A number of Oceanic terms translate as 'ghost ear'. Blust suggests that this reflects their spiritual significance, associated with the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi and with their sudden appearance after a thunder storm - which also accounts for the 'thunder ear' terms below. The distribution of 'ghost ear' terms perhaps justifies the reconstruction of POc _&ast;taliŋa qi qanitu_, literally 'ear of spirit of dead', but the term for 'spirit of dead' varies across languages.

In our data sources terms for different kinds of fungus tend to be very few, and only one reconstruction is offered, based on work by [French-Wright](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983)).

## Notes

[^1]: Much of the primary forest with which this chapter is concerned has disappeared in the past quarter-century, logged and replaced by coconut, oil palm and timber plantations. Surveys conducted in 1993-94 indicated that the few remaining natural portions of lowland forest on New Britain's north coast were in danger, and it was predicted that without active conservation all of the lowland forest of New Ireland would be selectively logged within a few years. There is already almost no primary forest left on the St Matthias Islands ([World Wildlife Fund 2007b](Source#cldf:WWF2007b)).

[^2]: This section owes much to [Benders-Hyde](Source#cldf:BendersHyde2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:BendersHyde2000)). The assignment of plants to the various layers in subsequent sections is largely due to [Conn & Damas](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)).

[^3]: The reconstruction of PCEMP _&ast;bail_ '_Falcataria moluccana_ or _Albizia_ sp.' is supported by the Oceanic data here, by Ambai (EMP, Yapen) _bai_ '_Falcataria moluccana_' ([Price & Merasi n.d.](Source#cldf:PriceandMerasind)), and by CMP items given by [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 189): Far-east Manggarai (Lengkosambi) _wail_, Far-east Manggarai (Mulu) _fail_, Rembong _faé_, Rongga, Ngadha, Ende _fai_, Sika _(ai)béi_, Solorese _baé_, all _Albizia_ chinensis.

[^4]: The reconstruction of PCEMP _&ast;ka(w)iak_ '_Albizia_ sp.' is supported by Nakanai (MM) _kai_ and by CMP items given by [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 189): Kepo, Razong, Rembong _kaé_, Waerana _kaék_, E Sumba _kawia[ka]_, all _Albizia_ chinensis.

[^5]: It is absent from [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988)), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001)) and [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005)).

[^6]: They are _C. cassia_, Cassia cinnamon, _C. zeylanicum_, Ceylon cinnamon and _C. saigonicum_, Saigon cinnamon.

[^7]: The history of this confusion is recounted in the [September 2000 Newsletter of the company Essentially Oils](https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050250/http://www.essentiallyoils.com/Newsletters/2000/September_2000_Newsletter/september_2000_newsletter.html) citing [Meijer](Source#cldf:Meijer1940) ([1940](Source#cldf:Meijer1940)), who clarified the origins of the two oils.

[^8]: POc _&ast;-q-_ is lost in Are. I do not know how a Javanese term might have found its way into Are - perhaps the name arrived in New Guinea with traders and spread along with its valued denotatum.

[^9]: [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 86--87) suggests that the Fijian form _makosoi_ can be analysed as _mako_ 'a forest tree, Cyathocalyx sp.' and _soi_, perhaps 'cut'. In view of the cognate set given here it seems more likely that the Fijian form reflects metathesis, perhaps as a result of folk-etymologising. However, on this hypothesis Fijian _-s-_ (for †_-ð-_) remains unexplained.

[^10]: Two tall _Dillenia_ species, _D. papuana_ and _D. montana_ grow respectively in the lowlands of the southeast peninsula of New Guinea and in the highlands (Corm & Damas 2006). Another, _Dillenia salomonensis_, is reported from the Solomons ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 140, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 120). The smaller _Dillenia biflora_ is found in Vanuatu and in Fiji ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 790, [Keppel et al. 2005](Source#cldf:Keppeletal2005)).

[^11]: Final _-uy_ is unexplained.

[^12]: [Gardner & Pawley](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)) attribute the name to the fact that its leaves are 'not unlike those of the breadfruit', since it appears to be a reduplication of Wayan _kulu_ 'breadfruit' (< POc _&ast;kuluR_, ch, 9, [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-7)). The Fijian forms reflect metathesis of the second and third vowels and this has perhaps generated a folk etymology associating the Wayan form with 'breadfruit'.

[^13]: Proto Erakor-Tafea is the immediate putative ancestor of S Efate and Proto Southern Vanuatu.

[^14]: [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 313) incorrectly spells it _E. formicarium_.

[^15]: J. [Parham](Source#cldf:Parham1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Parham1972): 176) cites _manawi_ as a Fijian name (dialect unspecified) for _Rhus_ simarubaefolia, so the Wayan term is apparently representative of a pan-Fijian meaning shift.

[^16]: [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 261) mentions that the black fruits, about 4cm in diameter, of several _Planchonella_ species are sometimes eaten raw in Papua New Guinea but gives little detail. Unlike other authors, he says that the trees are planted from seed. Since most _Planchonella_ species grow on mainland New Guinea and not in the Bismarcks, it is probable that his discussion relates to the mainland.

[^17]:  [Heyne](Source#cldf:Heyne1950) ([1950](Source#cldf:Heyne1950): 1315) lists a Ceram form _pasal_ _Vitex cofassus_ from an unnamed language, evidence that the POc form was an inheritance from PCEMP.

[^18]: In this instance Damon is describing a sample that has been brought to him: he notes that he has not seen the tree.

[^19]: The term _klambug_ is apparently a term for a taxon which includes several _Dillenia_ species.

[^20]: Proto South Melanesian is the putative ancestor of the Southern Vanuatu and New Caledonian languages ([Lynch 2000c](Source#cldf:Lynch2000c)).

[^21]: The name is sometimes spelt Evodia.

[^22]: Such etymologising evidently did not occur in Western Oceanic or SE Solomonic languages: cf Kara (E) _ria_, Lihir _dala_ and Kwara'ae _ʔabuan_ 'blood'. However, Marovo _juka-juka_ '_Myristica_ sp.' (from _juka_ 'blood', [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 118) also shows that the resemblance of _Myristica_ sap to blood is widely recognised.

[^23]: A further complication is that most terms of the genus _Parinari_ also have synonyms in which the genus is _Parinarium_ and the species modifer has the Latin neuter gender. Hence, _Parinari laurina_ = _Parinarium laurinum_. These synonyms are ignored here.

[^24]: Some recent sources prefer the term _Maranthes corymbosa_.

[^25]: Both _katita_ and _tita_ are recorded for Tolai.

[^26]: Polynesian terms reflect PPn &ast;piu where †_&ast;fiu_ is expected.

[^27]: The spelling _nə-vha-vha_ represents an attempt to interpret [Wheatley's](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992)) _nawhawha_ and is not necessarily accurate .

[^28]: In Motu POc _&ast;-l-_ > _-i-_ before _&ast;i_. Hence _&ast;bulu_ > _&ast;buiu_ > _&ast;biu_, then (irregularly) > _bio_.

[^29]: However, I am inclined to doubt the accuracy of the gloss, since (i) Peekel does not list this species and (ii) herbarium specimens are all from Bougainville.

[^30]: But [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 107) does not give sufficient information to identify the species at Marovo.

[^31]: See also the discussion of some of the items in this cognate set in [Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Chowning2001)).

[^32]: [Wolff](Source#cldf:Wolff1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Wolff1994)) argues that this term should not be reconstructed for PMP as the non-Oceanic items have denotata unconnected with _Semecarpus forstenii_. However, the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) includes Belau _ias_ '_Excoecaria agallocha_', a tree that also has toxic sap, thus supporting the PMP form.

[^33]: It is not clear whether POc _&ast;-w-_ was phonemic in this environment.

[^34]: Dioecious: a single plant is male or female. Monoecious: a single plant has reproductive units of both sexes.

[^36]: J. [Parham](Source#cldf:Parham1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Parham1972)) gives Fijian _veliyawa_ '_Merremia pacifica_' and _viliviwa_ '_Merremia peltata_' but does not name dialects.

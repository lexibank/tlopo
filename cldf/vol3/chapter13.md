## 1. Introduction


In his study of the uses of plants in central Pacific societies, [Thaman](Source#cldf:Thaman1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Thaman1994)) shows that a number of plants are cultivated for purposes other than food production, an observation that equally applies to NW Island Melanesia. There are a number of such plants that have probably been cultivated in the Bismarcks since Proto Oceanic (POc) times. The evidence of longtime cultivation lies in the domesticated varieties of certain plants that only occur under cultivation (sugarcane, _Morinda citrifolia_, _Codiaeum variegatum_, _Cordyline fruticosa_, _Dracaena_ angustifolia and _Heliconia indica_) and in the fact that some plants (sugarcane, some bamboo species, kava and _Broussonetia papyrifera_) only reproduce through the planting of cuttings and have no immediate wild relatives. Evidence that they have quite possibly been cultivated continuously since POc times is provided by the POc reconstructions in this chapter.

The plants treated in this chapter are used in a variety of ways. First there are those which are consumed by human beings but do not readily fall under the headings of earlier chapters: sugarcane is sucked to extract the sugar, betelnut is used as a stimulant, kava as a narcotic ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:3-13)). Then come plants which provide materials for making things: bamboo, the candlenut for illumination and black dyes, the paper mulberry for making bark cloth, and the Indian mulberry for yellow and red dyes ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-13)). Fish poisons are treated in [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-13), turmeric and ginger, which have various uses, in [§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:3-13), plants with large colourful leaves used for decoration and for magic in [§6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6#cldf:3-13) and cucurbits in [§7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:3-13). The pumpkin and the cucumber are of course foods, but cucurbits are discussed here, at the end of the volume, because (i) there is a question regarding the dating of the pumpkin' s introduction(s) into Oceania and (ii) they do not readily belong in any of chapters 9 to 12.

## 2. Plants grown for human consumption



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. _Saccharum officinarum_, sugarcane, TP suga (Poaceae)


Sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_ belongs to the family Poaceae, i.e., it is a grass, and is closely related to the wild species _Saccharum spontaneum_ ([ch.8, §3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:3-8)).


<a id="p-390"></a>

Sugarcane is a domesticate, only planted from cuttings, and numerous varieties are found in gardens all over lowland and highland areas of NW Melanesia. Sugarcane prospers especially where the soil is moist and rich ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 125-126, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 204, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 148). The jointed, fibrous stalks contain sucrose, obtained by cutting off a stem and chopping it into convenient lengths which are sucked and chewed as a refreshing snack. When the sugar has been sucked out, the rubbish is spat out.

The POc term &ast;topu 'sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_' continues PAn &ast;tebuS and is continued throughout Oceanic except in Polynesian, where reflexes attest to PPn &ast;to 'sugarcane' rather than expected †&ast;tofu .

### 2.2. Stimulants and narcotics


One traditional stimulant, the betelnut, _Areca catechu_ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:3-13) ), and one traditional narcotic, kava, _Piper methysticum_ ([§2.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-3#cldf:3-13)) are in more or less complementary distribution in Oceania. Betelnut is chewed throughout New Guinea and NW Island Melanesia, whilst kava is consumed in Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. The one point where the betelnut and kava domains overlapped was Vanikoro, to the east of the main Solomons archipelago (Darrell Tryon, pers. comm.). There were also locations in the small islands of the Admiralties and along the coast of the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea, i.e. in the betelnut domain, where kava was also used, having apparently found its way there from its place of domestication in Vanuatu.


<a id="s-2-2-1"></a>

#### 2.2.1. _Areca catechu_, betel palm, betelnut, TP buai, P bilnat, natnat (Arecaceae)


_Areca catechu_ is a slender palm which grows up to 30 m. Its crown is smaller relative to its height than that of a coconut, and leaflets are less densely spaced. A many-branched flower cluster develops below the leaf spathe, and the fruit develop from the flowers. The resulting branched cluster of fruit is a familiar sight in markets in lowland Papua New Guinea. The fruit consists of a seed enclosed in a thin green skin and a hard fibrous pericarp, i.e. husk ([Figure 13.1](#fig-3-13_1), left).


<a id="p-392"></a>

Figure 13.1: Left: _Areca catechu_, betelnut: __A__, tree; __B__, portion of inflorescence; __C__, portion of fruit cluster; __D__, fruit: longitudinal section showing fibrous exocarp and inner chewed 'nut'. Right: _Piper betle_: __E__, plant; __F__, __G__, __H__, flowering shoots of three varieties.

Chewing betelnut as a stimulant is widespread in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but not in other parts of the Pacific. Palms are grown in village groves or singly near houses. The seed may be chewed alone, but usually people chew a quid consisting of the seed, lime and a catkin or leaf of _Piper betle_ ([§2.2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-2#cldf:3-13)) ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 135).[^1] Chewing the seed induces salivation, and if lime is present it turns the chewed mass bright red. Some people swallow all but the initial burst of saliva, whilst others spit out the red masticate. Initially, chewing leads to a very short-lived dizziness, folllowed by a sense of renewed wakefulness. In Papua New Guinea and parts of the Solomons chewing betelnut is a social ritual when people meet. Convention requires that the host offer betelnut to visitors ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 146). The husk of the fruit is sometimes used to clean the teeth after chewing, as the quid causes uncleaned teeth to turn dark brown.

Like other palms, the trunk of the betel pallm can be split and the outer wood used for walling or flooring. In the western Solomons, liquid is squeezed from the husk into the eyes of conjunctivitis sufferers.


<a id="p-393"></a>

POc &ast;buaq '_Areca catechu_' is unusual, as both it and POc &ast;puaq 'fruit' evidently reflect a single etymon, PMP &ast;buaq, which had many meanings. Blust (ACD) gives the following glosses:

fruit; areca palm and nut; grain; berry; seed; nut; endosperm of a sprouting coconut; kidney; heart; finger; calf of the leg; testicle; various insects; scar tissue; roe; bud; flower; blossom; bear fruit; words, speech, or songs; meaning, contents of discussion; numeral classifier for roundish objects.

He makes the following observations:

 1. PMP &ast;buaq formed the head of many head-attribute constructions which functioned as the names of particular fruits (&ast;buaq kuluR 'breadfruit', &ast;buaq niuR 'coconut', &ast;buaq pahuq 'mango ', &ast;buaq punti 'banana', etc.) … .
 2. PMP &ast;buaq almost certainly functioned in addition as a numeral classifier which applied to roundish or fruit like objects … .
 3. Most WMP and CMP reflexes support an inference that the meanings 'fruit' and 'areca nut' were associated with the same morpheme, but the Oc[eanic] evidence suggests that there were two homophonous morphemes. I assume that one morpheme expressed both meanings, but that in POc these meanings become disassociated and connected respectively with oral and nasal grade reflexes of PMP &ast;buaq (POc &ast;puaq 'fruit', &ast;mpuaq [our POc &ast;buaq] 'betel [areca] nut') … Quite how this disassociation occurred is not clear, as no other similar cases are known. In [vol. 1 (ch.2, §2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:1-2)), I explained that PMP &ast;band &ast;p merged then split again into POc &ast;b and &ast;p. As a result, one cannot predict whether a PMP etymon with initial &ast;b- will begin with POc &ast;b- or with POc &ast;p--but PMP &ast;buaq is the only etymon known to have both outcomes, in POc &ast;buaq 'betel [areca] nut' and POc &ast;puaq 'fruit' .

Frantisek [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1998)) examines the question of whether POc speakers chewed betelnut, concluding that they did, since a suite of terms associated with betel chewing can be reconstructed. Certainly there are no grounds in the set below for thinking that POc &ast;buaq was diffused across Oceanic languages rather than continued from POc. The easternmost limit of betelnut-chewing is in the Temotu Province of the Solomons, but &ast;buaq is reflected in Southern Vanuatu, where it is applied to palms of other kinds (John Lynch, pers. comm.).

<a id="s-2-2-2"></a>

#### 2.2.2. _Piper betle_ (syn. _Chavica betle_), betel pepper, TP daka (Piperaceae)


The betel pepper vine, _Piper betle_, is a woody climber with catkins, pendulous spikes of berries in a crowded mass forming a cylindrical syncarp (a composite fruit) ([Figure 13.1](#fig-3-13_1) , right). It climbs on _Erythrina indica_ and Artocarpus incisa. The catkins and/or leaves are chewed with betelnut, _Areca catechu_ ([§2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:3-13)), and lime throughout the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 124, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001):226, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 115).

The reconstruction of POc &ast;[pu-]pulu 'betel pepper, _Piper betle_' is taken from [Lichtenberk's](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1998)) discussion of whether POc speakers chewed betelnut. His reconstruction of POc &ast;pulu is based partly on data assembled for the present project, with the addition of Chamorro pu-pulu '_Piper betle_', supporting the: PMP reconstruction, and a Manam reflex. I add Mussau _ulo_.

<a id="s-2-2-3"></a>

#### 2.2.3. _Piper methysticum_, kava (Piperaceae)


Figure 13.2: Leaves, stem and plant habit of kava, _Piper methysticum_

The kava plant, _Piper methysticum_, is a many branching plant with rounded green leaves. The plant is grown, usually near houses, exclusively from cuttings, and a narcotic is made from it in parts of Remote Oceania. Traditionally kava is consumed as a drink. The root is first reduced to small fragments by chewing, grinding or pounding. The fragments are deposited in a bowl, mixed with water and strained through the cloth-like fibre of a coconut spathe ([ch.12, §5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3#cldf:3-12)) to give a cloudy grey liquid ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 135). In Fiji, Tonga and Samoa the liquid is made from mature roots, is of low strength and plays a part in various ceremonies. In Vanuatu it is made from the roots of green plants and often has a much greater narcotic effect. Initially it causes the blood vessels in the lips and tongue to contract with a certain numbing effect. The drinker then senses some degree of euphoria, followed by a sense of calm well-being and clear thinking and a general relaxation of the muscles.


<a id="p-396"></a>

Kava is also consumed in scattered areas of New Guinea and the Bismarcks. In fact the only Oceanic-speaking areas in this region where it is or was drunk are the small southeastern islands of the Admiralties (Lou, Pam and Baluan; [Brunton 1988](Source#cldf:Brunton1988)) and among the Takia ofKarkar Island, where in the 1980s some older men told me that it had been drunk within their lifetimes. The Takia were traditionally in contact with Papuan-speaking villages on the Rai Coast (the north coast of the mainland east of Madang) where Mikloucho-Maclay ([Mikloucho-Maclay 1886](Source#cldf:MiklouchoMaclay1886), [1975](Source#cldf:MiklouchoMaclay1975)) reported that the kava root was chewed by some inhabitants of just a few villages. [Bourke](Source#cldf:Bourke1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Bourke1990)) considers that the limited distribution of kava indicates recent introduction, and Miklouho-Maclay noted in 1886 that it had only recently been introduced to the Rai Coast.

[Pawley & Green](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1973) ([1973](Source#cldf:PawleyandGreen1973)) proposed a POc reconstruction &ast;kawa '_Piper methysticum_'. However, the facts that _Piper methysticum_ only occurs in domesticated form and that it is not generally consumed in Oceanic-speaking communities in the Bismarcks imply that it was not present there in POc times, and that we should not expect to be able to reconstruct a POc term for it. The origin of kava has attracted a good deal of debate, both botanical and linguistic, over the past 35 years, partly because of its presence at New Guinea locations ([Brunton 1988](Source#cldf:Brunton1988), [Lebot 1989](Source#cldf:Lebot1989), [Lebot et al. 1992](Source#cldf:Lebotetal1992), T. [Crowley 1994](Source#cldf:Crowley1994), [Lynch 2002f](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f)).

The best supported hypothesis appears to be that _Piper methysticum_ is a domesticated variety of _Piper subbullatum_ (syn. _Piper wichmannii_),[^2] a plant of similar appearance which grows wild in the Solomons ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 206), and that this domestication took place in northern Vanuatu. The linguistic evidence for this position is presented by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f) ([2002f](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f)). He reconstructs a POc term &ast;kawaRi, which he glosses as 'root with special properties: one or more of _Zingiber zerumbet_, _Piper subbullatum_, fish-poison plants', i.e. as a generic term for what in the title of his article he calls 'potent roots'. He points out that none of the apparently directly inherited reflexes of &ast;kawaRi outside Vanuatu, Fiji and Polynesia means 'kava' or '_Piper methysticum_'. Only reflexes with a form that suggests borrowing have this meaning. The evidence suggests that POc &ast;kawaRi is reconstructable, but only with the 'potent roots' meaning. Only in northern Vanuatu and regions settled from it (the rest of Vanuatu, Fiji and Polynesia) do we find directly inherited reflexes denoting 'kava' or' _Piper methysticum_'. The reconstructions and directly inherited reflexes below are from ([Lynch 2002f](Source#cldf:Lynch2002f)), except where shown.[^3]

## 3. Plants which provide materials for making things



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. _Bambusa_, _Schizostachyum_ and_Nastus_ spp., bamboo, TP mambu, Bbambu (Poaceae)


Three genera of bamboos are represented in NW Island Melanesia: _Bambusa_, _Schizostachyum_ and _Nastus_. They are treated together here, since only one of the reconstructable terms can be related to a particular species. A number of species are often cultivated.

Three species of _Bambusa_, all thick-walled, are reported from the region. The most common in the Bismarcks and the largest in the Solomons is _Bambusa vulgaris_, with a culm (walled stem) about 5-10 m high and 10-15cm in diameter and a short internode distance around 30-50 cm. However, _Bambusa vulgaris_ was introduced after European contact (Rhys Gardner, pers. comm.) and was not among the denotata of the POc terms below. _B. blumeana_ is very similar and apparently important only in Malaita. _B. forbesii_, reported from the Bismarcks, is smaller, with a culm 2-4 m high and 1-4cm diameter, and has broad leaves ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 55-56, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 203-205).

_Bambusa_ bamboos are used in housing construction for beams and rafters, as well as to make containers for lime and water and tongs for lifting the hot stones of a stone oven ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 204--205). At Marovo they are used to make large traditional tuna-fishing rods and a whole stem serves as a 'ladder' to climb sago palms in order to cut its fronds ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 117).

Two species of the thin-walled genus _Schizostachyum_ are reported from the region. No comparative account is available, but the two appear similar. _Schizostachyum lima_, found in the Bismarcks, has a culm about 4--8 m high and 4--10cm in diameter, with internode lengths of 50-80 cm ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 55). _S. tessellatum_, found in the Solomons, is described as tall and very thin, growing wild in many habitats in clumps 10 m tall. It is the only bamboo amongst the three genera that is observed to flower regularly


<a id="p-399"></a>

_Schizostachyum_ species are a source of very straight, lightweight poles with many purposes: as battens from which to hang sago leaf thatch, as yam poles, as small fishing rods and as spears. Pieces of _Schizostachyum_ are used to make traditional panpipes and coconut scrapers. They are also used as fencing material ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):202-203, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 107, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 202).

Three species of the thin-walled genus _Nastus_ are reported from the region. One is _Nastus productus_, a small, often drooping bamboo. A second is _Nastus obtusus_, a very slender bamboo which is almost always cultivated and attains heights of over 20 m with stem diameters of 8-11cm and internode lengths of 50 em to a metre. A third _Nastus_ species is not given a scientific name,[^6] but sources describe it as pliant and behaving as a tree or ground creeper. It has very short internode lengths and small, narrow leaves ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 55, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 177, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 200-201).

The first two _Nastus_ species, and especially _Nastus obtusus_, have similar uses to those of _Schizostachyum_, but the third _Nastus_ species is considered by the Kwara'ae to be useless ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 176, 199-201, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001):200--202, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 112).

Figure 13.3: _Nastus obtusus_

The term reconstructed as _&ast;qauR_ 'bamboo spp.' below was probably the generic term for bamboos of the three genera mentioned above, as it still is in some modern languages. In Tolai, for example, we find the following:

[3-13-3-1-399-mm-tolai-kaur](cf.csv#cldf:3-13-3-1-399-mm-tolai-kaur)

PAn _&ast;qauR_ 'bamboo' is attested in Fom1osan languages, PMP _&ast;qauR_ 'bamboo' in languages across Indonesia (Blust, [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) ), and a number of Oceanic languages have reflexes indicating POc _&ast;qauR_. However, there are als:o a number of languages that reflect initial _&ast;k-_ rather than _&ast;q-_, and I show below the POc segments seemingly reflected by the consonant(s) of each form in order to illuminate the discussion here. In those Remote Oceanic languages which reflect POc _&ast;k-_ and _&ast;q-_ differently from one another the form indeed reflects initial _&ast;q-_. However, in Meso-Melanesian languages which reflect POc _&ast;k-_ and _&ast;q-_ differently and in Temotu languages the form reflects _&ast;k-_, not _&ast;q-_.


<a id="p-400"></a>

On the basis of Meso-Melanesian reflexes POc &ast;kauR 'bamboo' was reconstructed as in [vol.1 (ch.4, §6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:1-4)). However, non-Oceanic and Remote Oceanic data support _&ast;qauR_.[^7]

Among languages which retain a reflex of the final consonant, Mussau and Petats reflect _&ast;d_ or _&ast;dr_, rather than _&ast;R_, and Nakanai reflects _&ast;s_ or _&ast;c_.[^8] The Bilibil, Gedaged and Sio forms reflect final _&ast;-R_ where the final consonant is normally lost.

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Blust1984)) reconstructed POc _&ast;kaudru_[^9] 'bamboo sp.' to account for the Mussau, Petats and Selau forms.[^10] However, it does not account for the other irregularities below, and its putative reflexes are here treated as (albeit irregular) reflexes of POc _&ast;qauR_. Instead, the simplest linguistic explanation of these irregularities is that the forms reflect borrowings among neighbouring Oceanic languages. Indeed, it is possible that some of the forms with regular reflexes also result from borrowings, but happen to have regular reflexes of the consonants. However, it is not easy to see why such borrowings might have occurred, unless much of Near Oceania lacked useful bamboo species, and new species were imported by Oceanic speakers. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 107, 112, 117) hints at this when he writes that old people say that _Bambusa vulgaris_, _B. blumeana_, _Nastus obtusus_ and a _Schizostachyum_ species were all long ago introduced to Marovo from elsewhere. It is just possible that some of these borrowings were associated with the introduction of _Bambusa vulgaris_ after contact with Europeans.

[PAn &ast;_qauR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-3-1-400-POc-qaur-a)


<a id="p-401"></a>

Reflexes of POc _&ast;bʷau_ 'bamboo' are largely complementary to those of _&ast;qauR_ above, with overlaps on the mainland coast of the Vitiaz Strait and in New Caledonia. The Manam and Kaiep reflexes provide a weak indication that &ast;bʷau may have denoted bamboo as a construction material.

[POc &ast;_bʷau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-3-1-401-POc-bau-a)


<a id="p-402"></a>

Five more reconstructions are listed below: POc _&ast;bitu(ŋ)_ 'bamboo sp., probably _Schizostachyum glaucifolium_', POc _&ast;botu(ŋ)_, POc _&ast;kopu_, POc _&ast;bʷele_, POc _&ast;bue_ '(made of) bamboo'. Except for the first and last, the glosses of the supporting data do little to help elucidate their denotata, some of which were presumably taxa made up of one or more of the species discussed above. The gloss of Nakanai hele 'small cultivated bamboo used for thatching rods' suggests that it denotes a _Schizostachyum_ species, but this is insufficient information on which to base a gloss of POc _&ast;bʷele_.

The two reconstructions below are better supported by non-Oceanic than by Oceanic reflexes. Since _Bambusa_ vulgaris is a recent import, the Fijian and Polynesian glosses indicate that PCP &ast;hitu probably denoted _Schizostachyum_ glaucifolium. This may also be true of the POc reflex, but this is uncertain.

The only non-WOe evidence for POc _&ast;bʷele_ 'bamboo' is from Lonwolwol (NCV), where _bʷele-bo_ consists of _bʷele-_ 'hollow vessel' and _bo_, apparently reflecting PNCV _&ast;bue_ 'made of bamboo' (see below). A possible inference is that _&ast;bʷele_ denoted bamboo as a household utensil, e.g. a container for water.

[POc &ast;_bʷele_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-3-1-403-POc-bele-a)

Hus (Adm) _ʙu_ 'bamboo' corresponds regularly with the NCV items below, implying that it and PNCV _&ast;bue_ both reflect a POc _&ast;bue_ '(made of) bamboo'.

### 3.2. _Aleurites moluccana_ (syn._Aleurites triloba_), candlenut, P kandoltri, Bkandeltri (Euphorbiaceae)


_Aleurites moluccana_ is a tree which grows to between 10 and 35 m in height, depending on its location. Its young leaves and inflorescence are dusted with grey to rust-brown scurf, and the mature fruit is chestnut brown, 3-7cm in diameter. It has little pulp and a thick rind that encloses one or two very large seeds, the candlenuts. There appears to be considerable intra-species variation across its range, from India to eastern Polynesia, as well as a striking variety of uses. The seeds of some varieties are toxic, but others can be eaten without a problem. Even toxic seeds can often be eaten in small quantities, and the toxicity is reduced by roasting ([Henty 1982](Source#cldf:Henty1982), [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 87).


<a id="p-404"></a>

In Vanuatu _Aleurites moluccana_ is not cultivated, as planted seeds do not germinate well, but people protect new seedlings ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 88). In Fiji the tree occurs close to villages but not in the wild, implying that it is planted.

Figure 13.4: _Aleurites moluccana_: __A__, tree; __B__, leaves and inflorescence; __C__, whole fruit; __D__, kernel (candlenut).

The candlenut owes its name to the fact that in earlier times the nuts were threaded onto the midrib of a coconut palm leaf and lit, burning slowly one after another and giving a feeble light. The smoke given off is also a good insect repellant ([Sperlich 1997](Source#cldf:Sperlich1997)). Charred seeds are used in New Ireland to make a sooty paint for blackening the face in mourning ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 313) and by Ponapeans for making a black or brown dye. The oil extracted from them is also used as a paint base in New Britain ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)) and to polish wood in Fiji, where an extract of the seed is also used to scent the oil ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). The products of _Aleurites moluccana_ have numerous medicinal uses ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 89).

POc _&ast;tuRi-tuRi_ '_Aleurites moluccana_' is reconstructed below. It is quite widely supported, but it is by no means certain that its denotatum was _Aleurites moluccana_. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PEMP _&ast;tuRi-tuRi_ '_Aleurites moluccana_' on the basis of Biak kuker 'tree with edible nut' and Central Pacific reflexes. However, [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 72) believes that PPn _&ast;tuitui_ '_Aleurites moluccana_' was identical with _&ast;tuitui_ 'strung together', reflecting the fact that candlenuts are strung together for use as torches or sources of dye. He does not discuss Blust's reconstruction, but if Geraghty is right, the Biak, Motu and Roro terms must be dismissed as chance resemblances (none has the specific gloss _Aleurites moluccana_).

### 3.3. _Broussonetia papyrifera_, paper mulberry, TP burua (Moraceae)


_Broussonetia papyrifera_ is native to Japan and Taiwan and is an ancient introduction into the rest of the Pacific. A shrub or small tree 3-5, and sometimes up to 12, metres high, it is fertile in its native range, but the plants found throughout the Pacific are all male clones, transported and planted as rootstock. It is thus subject to deliberate propagation by human agency ([Whistler & Elevitch 2006a](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006a) ).

As Osmond & Ross noted in [vol.1 (ch.4, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:1-4)), [Kooijman](Source#cldf:Kooijman1972) ([1972](Source#cldf:Kooijman1972):446--453) believes from descriptions of manufacture and an examination of museum pieces that bark cloth in New Guinea was made from _Ficus_ and Artocarpus species rather than from _Broussonetia papyrifera_, from which bark cloth is made in other parts of the Pacific, e.g. Fiji ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). However, the glosses of the items listed below suggest fairly strongly that speakers of Oceanic languages in widely separated New Guinea locations were using _Broussonetia papyrifera_ to make bark cloth at European contact.

Figure 13.5: _Broussonetia papyrifera_, paper mulberry

POc _&ast;malo_ probably denoted _Broussonetia papyrifera_, the tree which throughout much of the Pacific provides the bast from which barkcloth is made. If this is so, then _Broussonetia papyrifera_ must have been introduced into the Pacific islands by early Oceanic speakers. [Matthews](Source#cldf:Matthews1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Matthews1996)), however, notes its absence from the Philippines and Borneo, and thinks it possible that it did not arrive in Polynesia with the earliest colonisers. POc _&ast;malo_ also denoted the cloth and the male genital covering made from it, and it is just possible that these were its primary meanings. It is also possible that some of the reflexes below reflect early Pacific Pidgin malo or maro 'loincloth'. PMP _&ast;mal(u,aw)_ apparently denoted a species of tree which provided bast for clothmaking, but it is unclear which species this was, as it is reconstructed on the basis of POc _&ast;malo_ and Kaili (WMP, Sulawesi: Parigi dialect) _malo_ 'old term for _Trema amboinensis_, the tree whose bast is most commonly used for barkcloth in Sulawesi' ([Adriani & Kruijt 1901](Source#cldf:AdrianiandKruijt1901): 140, note 5, cited by R. [Kennedy 1934](Source#cldf:Kennedy1934): 242).

### 3.4. _Morinda citrifolia_, Indian mulberry, yellow wood, P ialotri, Byelotri, noni (Rubiaceae)


A small tree, 5-6 min height, and occasionally more, up to 15m, _Morinda citrifolia_ ([Figure 13.6](#fig-3-13_6), left) grows throughout Oceania behind the beach and in dry soils exposed to the sun. [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 188) comments on the large shiny elliptical leaves about 20cm in length and 10cm broad. [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 539) recognises two varieties, one with green, yellow, white or variegated leaves, the other (var. bracteata) with enlarged calyx lobes. The small white flowers grow on an oval or cone-shaped structure, the syncarpium, which later swells to become the syncarp, 'a heavy, pungent smelling-sometimes repulsive-succulent fruit' ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 52). The fruits of wild varieties are spherical or elongated syncarps of 3-6cm and are soft and straw yellow at maturity, with numerous protuberances ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986):272 describes them as 'warty looking lumps'). Cultivated forms have paler, larger fruit with no protuberances, but are rarely found within village areas because of the strong smell when their fruit fall and rot ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 204-205).

_Morinda citrifolia_ is a tree with many uses in Oceanic speaking societies. Wild young trees are well known as a source of dyes, red and yellow, extracted by boiling the root-bark ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 99). In Marovo the dyes are applied to cocount-frond baskets, in Vanuatu to vegetable fibres used in items of apparel. S. [Foale](Source#cldf:Foale2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001)) describes it as an all-purpose medicine on Lihir, and [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 206--207) refer to research indicating that the Indian mulberry contains immuno-stimulant substances. This would explain its numerous medicinal uses. In Marovo, Manus and Tonga young leaves softened over the fire are applied to infected wounds and boils to draw out pus ([O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989), [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 133, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 207). In Vanuatu the raw fruit is crunched and eaten to treat an enlarged spleen. However, the plant is also cultivated and the fruit of the cultivated variety eaten, raw or cooked, on small islands scattered across Papua New Guinea, on the Temotu islands of the Solomons and in the Banks and Torres Islands of Vanuatu. Elsewhere the fruit of the wild variety is a famine food ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 205-207). In parts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomons the young leaves, which are a rich source of carotene, are cooked as a vegetable or consumed for medicinal reasons ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):54, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 272).


<a id="p-407"></a>

Figure 13.6: __Left__ _Morinda citrifolia_, Indian mUtlberry: __A__, mature tree; __B__, shoot bearing leaves, fruit and flowers. __Right__ _Derris_ species: __A__, climbing plant; __B__, base of mature vine; __C__, woody vine stem; __D__, vine with leaves and pods; __E__, stem with inflorescence; __F__, immature leaf.

There were apparently two POc labels for _Morinda citrifolia_, &ast;fiofiu and &ast;kurat. If [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 86) has correctly identified the referent of Bima (CMP) nonu as _Morinda citrifolia_ (he marks it with a question mark), then &ast;fiofiu is reconstructable for PCEMP and was inherited into POc. If Tagalog, Bisayan, Tausug nino _Morinda citrifolia_ ([Madulid 2001a](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a): 527) are also cognate with POc &ast;fiofiu, then PMP &ast;fiefiu is reconstructable. Milke reconstructed this etymon as POc &ast;fiofium with final &ast;-m, but the only reflexes with this segment are Gedaged nonom and Takia nom. Both languages lose POc final &ast;- VC, and it is more likely that -m in both languages irregularly reflects medial POc &ast;-fi-, with reduplication in Gedaged.

[Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:Geraghty1993)) speculates that &ast;fiofiu (his &ast;fiofium) was the name of the plant and &ast;kurat the name of the dye produced from it. In [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 91) he finds support for this speculation in evidence provided by [Mahdi](Source#cldf:Mahdi1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Mahdi1994): 192-193). Papuan languages of the North Halmahera family show forms such as Temate guraci 'turmeric', Tidore guraci 'gold', _guraci_ 'yellow'. These are the source of loans in Malaya-Polynesian languages of the South Halmahera family such as Buli &ast;guraci 'gold'. Geraghty suggests that such a form could also have been borrowed into languages of the New Guinea region and thence into early Oceanic. This proposal seems very plausible and leads to a speculation of my own. As Geraghty points out, the formal correspondence of the Halmahe:ra and Oceanic forms is perfect. In the light of this, it is possible that POc &ast;kurat reflects a PEMP form &ast;gurati meaning 'yellow dye'.


<a id="p-408"></a>

The distributions of POc _&ast;ñoñu_ and _&ast;kurat_ are complementary: _&ast;kurat_ is reflected solidly through Melanesia from New Ireland (Lihir, Tangga) through NW Solomonic (Nehan, Roviana), SE Solomonic, North/Central and Southern Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji, while _&ast;ñoñu_ occurs in the Admiralties, North New Guinea, Papuan Tip, Micronesian and Polynesian. These distributions suggest that POc _&ast;ñoñu_ was in some sense the default term for _Morinda citrifolia_ and that it was then replaced by _&ast;kurat_ in a solid Melanesian block from New Ireland to New Caledonia and Fiji. However, the reflexes of _&ast;kurat_ are generally regular, suggesting that replacement took place very early in the history of Oceanic.[^12]

## 4. Fish poisons


One method of catching fish was to put a toxic plant substance into an area of water surrounded by rocks or reef so that fish were stunned or killed and could then simply be collected by hand. As well as the plants described bellow, the seeds of the tree _Barringtonia asiatica_ ([ch.5, §5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-5)) were also used for this purpose.


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. _Derris_ spp., derris root, fish poison plant, TP _vut_ (Fabaceae)


The use of climbing shrubs of the genus _Derris_ to stun fish for an easy catch is known from the Bismarcks to Fiji (see [vol.1, ch.8, §7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:1-8)). However, of fifteen _Derris_ species that [Verdcourt](Source#cldf:Verdcourt1979) ([1979](Source#cldf:Verdcourt1979): 314--331) identifies in Papua New Guinea, only three are said to be used for fishing: _Derris elliptica_, _Derris_ elegans (syn. _D. rufula_, _Dillenia salomonensis_ and perhaps _Derris heterophylla_) and _Derris_ malaccensis. We can evidently add a fourth, as Peekel mentions the use of _Derris trifoliata_ (syn. _D. uliginosa_) to stun fish, a claim confirmed by [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 105).

In its wild form _Derris_ elliptica is a climbing shrub up to 10m high which grows in coastal locations ([Figure 13.6](#fig-3-13_6), right). Cultivated plants are mostly low and tangled, and produce thick fleshy roots which are scraped or crushed, then stirred into shallow water to benumb fish so that they can be easily caught.

Chewing derris root and then swallowing copious amounts of water was the traditional means of suicide in NW Island Melanesia.


<a id="p-410"></a>

_Derris trifoliata_ is a smaller species but has a thicker stem, larger leaves and a weaker fish- stunning effect than _Derris elliptica_ ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 243). [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 105) reports that in Marovo _Derris trifoliata_ is indigenous, and _Derris elliptica_ has been introduced from New Guinea.

It seems likely that POc &ast;tupa referred to _Derris_ creepers in general, or at least to those used in fishing, and perhaps also to _Derris elliptica_ in particular, as this was the source of the strongest poison. Also reconstructable are

- POc &ast;puna(t) 'vine used for fish poison, probably _Derris elliptica_'
- PWOc &ast;m(ʷ)ali '_Derris_ sp.'
- PROc &ast;vuba 'k.o. vine, probably _Derris elliptica_'

but I am unable to determine how they differed in meaning from each other or from &ast;tupa.

[PMP &ast;_tuba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-4-1-410-POc-tupa-a)

PMP _&ast;bunat_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic data here and Botolan Sambal bunat '_Derris elliptica_'.

[PMP &ast;_bunat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-4-1-410-POc-punat-a)


<a id="p-411"></a>

PWOc _&ast;(m,mʷ)ali_ (incorrectly given as _&ast;maRi_ in [vol. 1, ch.8, §7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:1-8)) is reconstructed on the basis of North New Guinea and Meso-Melanesian languages:

[PWOc &ast;_(m,mʷ)ali_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-4-1-411-PWOc-mmali-a)

[Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) offer two Proto Micronesian reconstructions with the gloss 'fish poison' or '_Derris_ sp.'. One is PMic _&ast;(t,T)upa_, continuing POc _&ast;tupa_ and reflected only in Woleaian _sūpe_ 'fish poison (root)'. Since _sūpe_ has _-p-_ for †_-f_ and PMic _&ast;(t,T)upa_ is reconstructed for expected †_&ast;tufa_, the reconstruction is suspect. The other PMic reconstruction is _&ast;upa_ 'derris vine ', which is well supported in Micronesian languages and appears to have cognates in Southern Vanuatu, permitting reconstruction of PROc _&ast;vuba_.

## 5. Multi-purpose roots


Turmeric and ginger are both cultivated for their roots, which have a variety of uses. Among these are magical applications, shared with the first three plants in [§6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6#cldf:3-13). Like the candlenut ([§3 .2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-13)) and Indian mulberry ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:3-13)) turmeric also produces a dye.


<a id="p-412"></a>


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. _Curcuma longa_ (syn. _Curcuma domestica_), turmeric (Zingiberaceae)


The turmeric: plant, _Curcuma longa_, is much smaller than Alpinia species, being only 50-120cm tall, but it is treated by at least speakers of Marovo and Kwara'ae as belonging to the same taxon as Alpinia ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001):193-194, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131).[^14] It has long green leaves and pale yellow flowers. The rhizome is lumpy and an intense yellow ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 109).

Although it grows readily in the wild in locations where there is light, the Marovo and Kwara'ae sources also report that it is often cultivated. The rhizome provides spice. It is also a source of yellow dye, but the colour fades easily ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 109). At Marovo the aromatic leaves are used for parcelling fish for the stone oven.

Turmeric also has ritual significance. At Marovo it is planted to keep evil spirits away from gardens, and in both Marovo and Kwara'ae the roots are chewed and spat out of the door or window of the house to fend off evil spirits ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131). The Kwara'ae also chew it both with betelnut and alone, the latter both as a snack and medicinally.

[Figure 13.7](#fig-3-13_7)     _Curcuma longa_

There are two reconstructions, POc _&ast;yaŋo_ and PEOc _&ast;re(ŋ,ŋʷ)a_. There is some evidence in the glosses of reflexes that the latter meant yellow material, including prepared turmeric and perhaps the yolk of an egg.

[POc &ast;_yaŋo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-5-1-412-POc-yao-a)

The root above was the source of the POc term for 'yellow', _&ast;yaŋo-yaŋo_:

<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. _Zingiber_ spp., ginger, TP _kawawar_ (Zingiberaceae)


_Zingiber officinale_ (common ginger), 50-120cm tall, cultivated and wild, serves as a spice plant, medicine and magic ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):100). It appears to have arrived in Near Oceania a long time ago (R.M. Bourke, pers. comm.), but does not seem to have been carried into (at least parts of) Remote Oceania until European contact, where the only species of ginger was _Zingiber zerumbet_ ('wild ginger', 'shampoo ginger', 'pinecone ginger'), a woody shrub, 80-120 cm high with long narrow green leaves and magnificent red flowers which resemble a pinecone in shape. It is widely cultivated, with numerous cultivars.


<a id="p-414"></a>

If it is true that _Zingiber officinale_ did not find its way into Remote Oceania with Oceanic speakers, then one must ask whether it had in fact arrived in NW Island Melanesia by POc times. This is a matter which seems to require further research.

In Marovo wild ginger was associated with magic and sorcery. The leaves of particular varieties were important in calling on ancestor spirits, and the roots were chewed for magical purposes. In earlier times, one was planted at each comer of a garden to protect it against destructive magic. The roots of some varieties are chewed for their healing properties. Because of these associations, ginger is rarely used in ordinary cooking ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 130).[^16] [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 101) in any case reports that the rhizome of _Zingiber zerumbet_ is less tasty than those of other _Zingiber_ species.

Two POc terms are reconstructed below. The gloss of the first, _&ast;laqia_, remains a little doubtful because of the difficulty in dating the arrival of _Zingiber officinale_ in NW Island Melanesia. POc _&ast;para(k)_ evidently referred to Zingiberaceae species but just how large a taxon it denoted is currently unknown.

[PMP &ast;_laqia_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-5-2-414-POc-laqia-a)

PSES _&ast;ria_ 'ginger' (Gela _ria_ 'ginger', W Guadalcanal, Arosi _ria_ 'turmeric', Kwaio _lia_ 'turmeric') is evidently derived from POc _&ast;laqia_ by borrowing rather than by direct inheritance, as the expected PSES form is †_&ast;laɣia_.

PMP _&ast;badak_ is tentatively reconstructed below on the basis of the Tolai and Wayan Fijian items and of Tagalog _barak_ 'Curcuma zedoaria, _Zingiber zerumbet_', Kuyunon _barak_ '_Curcuma domestica_, Globba marantina' ([Madulid 2001a](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a)).

## 6. Plants with large colourful leaves


Here four plants are discussed. The first three, _Codiaeum variegatum_, _Cordyline fruticosa_ and _Dracaena angustifolia_, are described separately but the reconstructions are presented together in [§6.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-4#cldf:3-13) because there is evidence of a POc taxon, _&ast;jiRi_, which included '_Cordyline fruticosa_ and _Dracaena angustifolia_ and of a PWOc taxon, _&ast;mʷa(r,R)e, which included _Codiaeum variegatum_ and _Cordyline fruticosa_. All three species are cultivated for their brightly coloured glossy leaves and are used decoratively, ceremonially and ritually.


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. _Codiaeum variegatum_, croton, TP purpur, Bkala lif (Euphorbiaceae)


_Codiaeum variegatum_ usually takes the form of a non-woody shrub a metre or more in height, consisting of a clump of large leathery leaves, at their largest 30cm by 9 em. In the wild the leaves are green and the plant may grow into a small tree up to 5 m tall. Under cultivation the leaves vary greatly in shape and colour, and traditionally, _Codiaeum variegatum_ was cultivated for its brilliant colours, although it grows in the wild in open locations with access to sunlight ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 313,[Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):89, 91). [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 175) names five cultivars, four of them distinguished by colour (green, yellow, red and dark red).


<a id="p-416"></a>

_Codiaeum variegatum_ shrubs were cultivated around the edges of villages for their decorativeness and as boundary markers and markers of taboo sites like graves. They also provided a source ofleaves to decorate men's bodies during dances ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 175, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 91, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 117, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).[^17]

On New Britain the bark or the leaves were rubbed on the skin to cure skin diseases ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)). On Waya Island the leaves are used in the treatment of high blood pressure ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. _Cordyline fruticosa_ (syn. _Cordyline terminalis_, _Taetsia fruticosa_), cordyline, victory leaf, ti plant, TP tangget, Bnanggaria (Agavaceae)


_Cordyline fruticosa_ has a woody stem usually 1-2m high with no branches; the leaves issue from the top of the stem. There is a great variety of leaf shapes from long and narrow to broadly oval and a great variety of leaf colours: green with white: or red stripes, white with green or red stripes, rose-red, rose-red and dark-red stripes, and dark-redl to blackish purple ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 81-83).

The cordyline has a tuber which is edible and occasionally eaten in Papua New Guinea, although it may have been used more extensively for food in the past. Its young leaf shoots are sometimes cooked and eaten ([Barrau 1965](Source#cldf:Barrauetal1965), [Bourke 1982](Source#cldf:Bourke1982): 60, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 335). The Saliba eat the flowers, cooked with leaves of _Gnetum gnemon_ ([ch.10, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:3-10)) ([Margetts 2005b](Source#cldf:Margetts2005b)). The Molima simply add them to the cooking pot (A. Chowning, pers. comm.). _Cordyline fruticosa_ is used for plot markers, and tuberous root as an item of clothing, and as a warning to thieves ([Bourke 1982](Source#cldf:Bourke1982)).

Leaves of C.fruticosa are worn by dancers in New Britain ([Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 94). Bourke comments on the spiritual significance of C.fruticosa in some Papua New Guinea societies. The Marovo believe that cordyline holds spiritual power, and different cultivars of cordyline are used for different kinds of magic, often exercised by holding the leaf itself ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 118). It also functions as a charm against magic among the Kwaio and the Kwara'ae, and the latter is the one place where a non-decorative, non-ritual use is mentioned: it is used to wrap lizards for cooking ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 180). On Waya Island it is usually planted in villages and at taboo sites, and today often at graves. Different varieties were used for different kinds of magic ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

### 6.3. _Dracaena angustifolia_ (Liliaceae)



<a id="p-417"></a>

In its mature form _Dracaena angustifolia_ is a woody shrub growing to 3-6 m high. It has no bole and splits into many branches at ground level. Each branch splits again recursively, and at the end of each branch, issuing directly from it, is a plume of long narrow leaves. In cultivated varieties these leaves are often brightly striped. _Dracaena angustifolia_ receives far fewer mentions in the literature than croton or cordyline: Hviding, for example, does not mention it. This may be because non-botanist observers have confused the species or because _Dracaena angustifolia_ has less magical and taboo significance. [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 181) say that it is used for living fences. However, the Arosi dictionary describes it as a very sacred plant which is planted on burial grounds and on gardens to protect crops, is used in divination, and is waved at the annual harvest ceremony ([Fox 1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)). Sa'a speakers use the leaves in incantations, in bonito ceremonials and in malevolent magic ([Ivens 1929](Source#cldf:Ivens1929)). On Ulawa the priest uses a _Dracaena_ branch bound with a climbing fern to draw out the yam beetles when a garden is dedicated for planting. Such a branch is then planted at the entrance stile to keep out disease ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):360, 362).


<a id="s-6-4"></a>

### 6.4. Reconstructions


_Cordyline_ and _Dracaena_ varieties are both used as decorative plants and for making leaf skirts, and many Oceanic languages treat them as a single taxon. In E Kara (MM), for example, si denotes _Cordyline fruticosa_, and the binomial si tavul is _Dracaena angustifolia_. In Kwara'ae _Cordyline fruticosa_ is dili and _Dracaena angustifolia_ is mala-dili 'resembling cordyline' (see [ch.2, §7 .1.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-4#cldf:3-2) ). Each of the cognate sets below spans plants of both genera, and it is probable that many more of the glosses should refer to both _Cordyline_ and _Dracaena_: the full span of the denotation was missed when the data were recorded.

[Chowning](Source#cldf:Chowning1963) ([1963](Source#cldf:Chowning1963), [2001](Source#cldf:Chowning2001): 81) suggests that the 'Prato-Melanesian' terms _&ast;babaka_,[^18] _&ast;dili_ (my POc _&ast;jiRi_ '_Cordyline_ sp., _Dracaena_ sp.') and _&ast;male_ (my PWOc _&ast;mʷa(r,R)e_ '_Codiaeum variegatum_; _Cordyline fruticosa_') were each used collectively for three species. Her first two species are _Codiaeum variegatum_ and _Cordyline fruticosa_. Her third, however, is not _Dracaena angustifolia_, but _Cycas rumphii_. She writes that all three are 'used primarily for decorative and magico-religious purposes' ([Chowning 1963](Source#cldf:Chowning1963)).[^19]

It is quite possible that PWOc _&ast;mʷa(r,R)e_ indeed denoted a taxon including Codiaeum variegatum and _Cordyline fruticosa_, and perhaps other decorative plants (note Nakanai _mamale_ '_Cananga odorata_'), but I have found no evidence of a term that denoted plants of all three species. Possibly Chowning considered some of the items collected together under PEOc _&ast;mʷa(q)ele_ 'cycad' ([ch.9, §5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-9)) to belong to the same cognate set as the items under PWOc _&ast;mʷa(r,R)e_ below. Despite the formal similarity between the two reconstructions, however, the two cannot be reconciled: reflexes of the former agree in reflecting _&ast;-l-_, the latter in reflecting _&ast;-(r,R)-_. The two sets can be united only by positing irregular sound change or borrowing.[^20]

Three other etyma are reconstructed below: POc _&ast;jiRi_, _&ast;kaRi(q)a_ and _&ast;jajal_. POc _&ast;jiRi_ indeed introduces a third species into the discussion, but it is _Dracaena angustifolia_, not _Cycas rumphii_. The distribution of the reflexes of POc _&ast;kaRi(q)a_ 'taxon of decorative plants' leaves us unable to determine which of the three species it denoted. POc _&ast;jajal_ probably denoted a particular variety of _Codiaeum variegatum_.

### 6.5. _Heliconia indica_, heliconia, Blif laplap (Heliconiaceae)


Two species of _Heliconia_ grow in NW Island Melanesia, _Heliconia indica_ in eastern mainland New Guinea and the Bismarcks and _Heliconia solomonensis_ in Bougainville and the Solomons (R. Gardner, pers. comm.). The two appear to be very· similar ([Figure 13.10](#fig-3-13_10), left).[^21] Numerous short stems formed from leaf sheaths rise from an underground rhizome to a height of 5 or 6 m. The leaves resemble banana leaves, and under cultivation assume various colours and patterns: yellow, yellow-and-green striped, bright red or dark red. In the wild heliconias grow in damp shady environments in primary and secondary forest.

The leaves are used for covering and sealing the stone oven because of their thick, waxy cuticle and very large leaf surfaces. Thanks to their size, fewer are needed, reducing the labour of cutting and carrying ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):239, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 196, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 120).

<a id="s-6-6"></a>

### 6.6. _Crinum asiaticum_, spider lily (Amatyllidaceae)


_Crinum asiaticum_ is a large lily with long erect leaves that are arranged in a spiral rosette to form impressive clumps up to 1.5 m in height and 2 m wide ([Figure 13](#fig-3-13) .10, right). The leaves may be a metre long and 10cm wide. They emerge from huge bulbs that may weigh as much as 9 kg. Its white flowers, with thick succulent stems, are shaped like tubes that flair open into a crown of narrow petals.[^22] [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 103) distinguishes between _Crinum asiaticum_, which is cultivated, and _Crinum pedunculatum_, which grows wild in sandy areas near beaches and in other damp locations. [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 216) distinguish between a green-leaved wild variety of _Crinum asiaticum_ and a yellow-leafed variety cultivated for decoration in villages.


<a id="p-422"></a>

Figure 13.10: Left: _Heliconia_ solomonensis: __A__, plant; __B__, mature inflorescence, open and showing fruit. Right: _Crinum asiaticum_, spider lily.

At Tinputz (Bougainville) the pounded roots of this plant were mixed with red iron oxide and the mixture was rubbed onto coconut palm trunks to ensure that they bore well ([Blackwood 1935](Source#cldf:Blackwood1935): 311). The Nakanai of New Britain and the Marovo use the light-coloured leaf bases as trolling lures to catch large fish, in Marovo barracuda and Spanish mackerel ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 103, [Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)). The Nakanai also use the leaves for making women's leaf skirts. In Marovo the leaves are used to treat bruises and fractures.

The forms listed below are clearly cognate, but it is not clear whether or how many of the parenthesised segments of the Kairiru and Kilivila forms reflect part of the protoform: hence the question mark against _&ast;mʷalak_.

## 7. Cucurbits


The four plants discussed below, namely the bottle gourd (_Lagenaria siceraria_), the wax gourd (_Benincasa hispida_), the pumpkin (_Cucurbita moschata_) and the cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_) have in common not only that they all grow on vines but, more relevant here, that the dates and directions of their introductions into Oceania have been objects of controversy. The linguistic evidence supports the controversial claim that the pumpkin, _Cucurbita moschata_, was absent from the world of POc speakers but arrived soon after the break-up of POc.


<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. _Lagenaria siceraria_ (syn. _Lagenaria vulgaris_, _Lagenaria leucantha_, _Cucurbita siceraria_, _Cucurbita lagenaria_), bottle gourd, TP _kambang_ (Cucurbitaceae)


The bottle gourd, _Lagenaria siceraria_, is grown throughout much of the Pacific, mainly for its value as a container and occasionally for its food value ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 107). The plant originated in Africa, but had spread across much of the world in pre-Columbian times. [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 189) regards it as an ancient plant in Melanesia, but no POc form can be reconstructed, as noted by [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996d) ([1996d](Source#cldf:Ross1996d)).

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) reconstructs PNCV _&ast;tavaya_ (Raga _tavai_, Mota _wo-tavae_), which, together with Bauan _tavaya_ 'bottle', implies PEOc _&ast;tapaya_. But no cognates of the latter nor alternative cognate sets have been found in Western Oceanic or Admiralties languages, implying that the bottle gourd was not known to POc speakers. Surveying recent findings, [Green](Source#cldf:Green2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:Green2000)) suggests quite strongly that this was the case. The gourd may well have reached Oceania from two directions, arriving in Melanesia from the Indo-Malaysian region and much later in eastern Polynesia from South America. There is good evidence that the Polynesians did not carry the gourd with them into eastern Polynesia ([Whistler 1990](Source#cldf:Whistler1990), 1991). It is thus possible - and on the linguistic evidence likely - that the bottle gourd first reached the Bismarck Archipelago after the break-up of POc.


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. _Benincasa hispida_, wax gourd, white gourd, winter melon (Cucurbitaceae)


[Golson](Source#cldf:Golson2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Golson2002)) also provides a survey of archaeological evidence which shows that allegedly pre-Oceanic dates for the bottle gourd in Oceania are the result of misidentification of remains of the wax gourd, _Benincasa hispida_. [Whistler](Source#cldf:Whistler1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Whistler1990)) similarly shows that reports of the bottle gourd in Polynesia reflect incorreclt identifications of the wax gourd. The latter is a native of SE Asia and archaeological evidence indicates that it was present at least on mainland New Guinea when the Austronesian speaking ancestors of POc speakers arrived there. There are terms for it in non-Oceanic languages: terms from Philippine languages listed by [Madulid](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b) ([2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 42) together with Malay kundur point to a possible PMP _&ast;kundur_, but this may be an outcome of borrowings across island SE Asia ([Wolff 1994](Source#cldf:Wolff1994)). [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 195) cites terms that point to a possible PCMP _&ast;kelas_. As Golson points out, the botanical literature indicates that _Benincasa hispida_ is at least occasionally present at locations on the mainland and in the Bismarcks where Oceanic languages are spoken today. In support of this he cites [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 547-548) and [Borrell](Source#cldf:Borrell1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Borrell1989): 66). [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 108) also indicates that _Benincasa hispida_ is grown in Papua New Guinea, but does not specify locations.


<a id="p-424"></a>

Whistler provides names for _Benincasa hispida_, listed below, which allow us to reconstruct Proto Central Pacific _&ast;vaŋ(o,u)_. I have accepted his arguments for glossing the Fijian terms as _Benincasa hispida_: his sources (H. B. R. [Parham 1943](Source#cldf:Parham1943), [Capell 1941](Source#cldf:Capell1941)) gloss them as species of Lagenaria. Despite the obvious presence of _Benincasa hispida_ further west I have been unable to reconstruct an earlier term for it, but not for the usual reasons. Usually, a term is not reconstructable because there are no cognates in the data or because cognates are insufficiently widespread. In the case of _Benincasa hispida_, however, there are no data from outside Fiji and Polynesia except Peekel's Patpatar _hulhul paraho_. This can only indicate that, even if _Benincasa hispida_ was present in early Oceanic times, its presence and significance in the agricultural suite of Oceanic-speaking societies has faded almost to zero.[^23]

[PCP &ast;_vaŋ(o,u)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-13-7-2-424-PCP-vaou-a)


<a id="s-7-3"></a>

### 7.3. _Cucurbita moschata_, pumpkin, TP pamken (Cucurbitaceae)


[Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 190) declares that the pumpkin[^24] is a European introduction to Melanesia, and the linguistic data largely support his assertion. A number of terms for it are borrowings from English (MM: E Kara baniyin, Tinputz banken, NCV: Paamese vamuken, Lewo pamken) or from elsewhere (PT: Motu mausini, Roro mauteni, apparently from Samoan mau- tini 'gourd ').

The set of seeming cognates below provides evidence, on the other hand, of an early Oceanic etymon, _&ast;waluq_ or _&ast;[w]aruq_, thatmusthave denoted _Cucurbita moschata_ or a similar plant. I write 'seeming' because, however one reconstructs the term, there are irregular phonological developments due to borrowing. [Dempwolff](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938)) reconstructed _&ast;baluq_ 'bottle gourd, _Lagenaria siceraria_'. However, the Oceanic forms below, together with Sundanese, Old Javanese, Balinese _waluh_, Buru _walu_ 'bottle gourd', point to PMP _&ast;waluq_ 'bottle gourd'. Whether PMP actually had such a form or whether this is a series of borrowings postdating the break-up of PMP and perhaps even of POc (cf [§7.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1#cldf:3-13)) is not relevant here. What is relevant is that a form related to these entered early Oceanic, but was applied to the pumpkin, _Cucurbita moschata_, or a related species.


<a id="p-425"></a>

If we assume that the Oceanic etymon was _&ast;waluq_, then the consonants are regularly reflected in Kela, Dami and Takia. Sio reflects _&ast;waruq_, and Kela may also do so, as _&ast;-l-_ and _&ast;-r-_ are neutralised as Kela _-r-_. Hote, Mapos Buang and Patep reflect _&ast;ruq-aruq_ and Lenakel and Anejom reflect _&ast;ruq-ruq_.[^25] Gapapaiwa and Misima _bonu-bonu_ (and similar forms in other PT languages) reflect _&ast;bʷalu-bʷalu_. If we assume instead that the Oceanic etymon was &ast;waruq or &ast;aruq, we are still left with irregularities.

The strong likelihood, then, is that the term was borrowed from community to community sometime very soon after the break-up of POc. That is, _Cucurbita moschata_ or a similar plant must have found its way into NW Melanesia not much less that 3000 years ago. The genus Cucurbita is indigenous to the tropical zone of the Americas, where domestication is known to have occurred by 4000 years ago ([Sauer 1993](Source#cldf:Sauer1993)).

This finding is not at odds with the historical fact that the modern pumpkin was introduced to NW Melanesia by Europeans after 1870. It simply indicates that a variety of _Cucurbita moschata_ or a similar plant was already present, and had been present for a long time, albeit perhaps as a very minor crop in a few areas.

<a id="s-7-4"></a>

### 7.4. _Cucumis sativus_, cucumber (Cucurbitaceae)


Because of the varieties that have been introduced since 1870, it is sometimes assumed that the cucumber is a crop introduced by Europeans. However, [Bourke & Allen](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming) ([forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)) write that it was probably introduced via SE Asia thousands of years ago. The cognate set supporting the reconstruction of POc _&ast;[ka]tim(o,u)n_ 'cucumber, _Cucumis sativus_' below con- firms that the cucumber was part of the world of POc speakers, even though it is not indigenous to the Pacific. The genus Cucumis has its origins in Africa, and the cucumber is one of the few African species known to have been domesticated outside Africa. Until recently it was thought that it was part of a suite of plants that were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of SW Asia or in India, but recent work in molecular biology has cast doubt on this, placing the cucumber instead in an Asian-Australian clade of the genus Cucumis ([Renner et al. 2007](Source#cldf:Renneretal2007)). There is thus no biogeographic challenge to the proposal that the cucumber was known to both PMP and POc speakers.


<a id="p-426"></a>

Blust (ACD) produces strong evidence to suggest that the denotatum of POc _&ast;[ka]tim(o,u)n_ was the cucumber, but the reflexes below suggest that it may also have been used of other species of Cucumis.

The initial syllable of _&ast;[ka]tim(o,u)n_ is reflected only in Western Oceanic languages , whereas Central Pacific reflexes point to _&ast;timun_. This distribution justifies the reconstruction of POc forms with and without initial _&ast;ka-_, which may represent or have been reanalysed as the prefix _&ast;ka-_ 'tree' reflecting earlier _&ast;kayu_ 'tree' ([ch.2, §7.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-2#cldf:3-2)).

Shown in parentheses below are irregular phonological developments, implying that al- though the term was inherited into POc, it was sometimes borrowed from one language into another.

[^24]: Barrau refers to the pumpkin as _Cucurbita pepo_. In Papua New Guinea, at least, the common pumpkin is _Cucurbita moschata_, not _C. pepo_ (R.

## 1. Introduction


Arboriculture apparently played a role in Bismarcks food production long before the arrival of Austronesian speakers and the latter quite possibly acquired some of their arboriculture practices from Papuan speaking neighbours ([chapter 2, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-2)). With the introduction of agriculture, garden and forest tended to overlap. Sometimes the garden would include food-bearing trees that survived from the primary forest, and sometimes food-bearing species would be planted in a garden or orchard or near to the village. At the same time, forest trees continued to be tended in situ and came to be owned by particular families.

[Kennedy & Clarke](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)) and others have emphasised the cline that ranges from trees which grow wild in the bush to trees that are cultivated in orchards, with various degrees of tree-tending between the two extremes. Continuous cultivation entails domestication, i.e. ongoing control of reproduction and selection of varieties through the planting of ripe fruits or germinated seeds or through the transplanting of vigorous seedlings ([Yen 1991](Source#cldf:Yen1991)). The resulting cultivars often have separate local names, whereas forest varieties generally do not. [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 73-74) suggest that the geographic distribution of domesticated tree species reflects human settlement in the Pacific. As domesticated species they list the following: canarium nuts, _Canarium_ spp., the Tahitian chestnut, _Inocarpus fagifer_, cutnuts, _Barringtonia edulis_, _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ and _Barringtonia procera_, the Polynesian plum, alias golden apple, _Spondias cytherea_, the island lychee, _Pometia pinnata_, and the Malay apple, _Syzygium malaccense_. To this list [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 56-57) add the dragon plum, _Dracontomelon vitiense_ and [Yen](Source#cldf:Yen1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Yen1991)) adds _Burckella obovata_. [Paijmans](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 123-124) notes that in the New Guinea region _Terminalia catappa_ and _Terminalia kaernbachii_ are also often planted.

All are actively cultivated close to villages and have been subject to continuous selection. Often they grow interspersed with coconut palms and breadfruit trees (themselves both domesticated species) on a piece of land close to the village, along with recently introduced citrus species. Actual tending is minimal; young seedlings are protected from the sun, weeds are removed, dead or damaged branches are cut off and the tree is sometimes pruned to reduce its height ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 74--76).


<a id="p-312"></a>

The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows. First, domesticated nut trees are treated ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:3-11)), then domesticated fruit trees ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-11)), and finally trees that are regularly exploited for their fruit but are generally not domesticated ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-11)). The boundary around this last category is somewhat arbitrary. It includes trees which are often mentioned in the literature as sources of edible fruit. It excludes trees that are more often mentioned as having other uses: these include _Morinda citrifolia_, and various species of _Diospyros_, _Macaranga_ and _Garcinia_, the fruits of which are all mentioned by [Paijmans](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124) as occasionally consumed. It also excludes those species of _Ficus_ which have edible figs, as these are treated in [ch.10, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-10).

The trees investigated by [Kennedy & Clarke](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)) in their examination of arboriculture include three that are considered among the staple foods in chapter 9: the banana plant ([ch.9, §3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-9)), the breadfuit tree ([ch.9, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-9)), and the sago palm ([ch.9, §5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:3-9)). Another cultivated tree is _Gnetum gnemon_, the leaves of which serve as a green vegetable, treated in [chapter 10, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:3-10). These trees and plants are not considered further here, nor is the coconut palm, which is discussed in some detail in chapter 12. Instead, the focus of this chapter is nut- and fruit-bearing species that loom large in Bismarcks arboriculture.

## 2. Domesticated nut trees


Ironically none of the genera considered in this section is a true nut, but agriculturalists writing about Pacific plants ([Bourke 1996](Source#cldf:Bourke1996), [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999)) call them nuts and it is convenient to retain this usage. Botanically nuts are single-seed dry fruits in which the seed remains separate from its hard enveloping pericarp. Examples are the hazelnut, Corylus americana, and the chestnut, Castanea dentata. Many 'nuts' in popular parlance are botanically drupes rather than nuts. In a drupe the peri carp consists of an outer skin or exocarp, a middle layer or mesocarp and a very hard inner layer or endocarp surrounding the seed. 'False nuts' consist of the endocarp and seed of a drupe. They include the first five genera discussed here - canarium almonds, _Canarium_ spp. ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-11)), the sea almond and the okari nut, _Terminalia_ spp. ([§2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:3-11)), cutnuts, _Barringtonia_ spp. ([§2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:3-11)), and the various species of _Pandanus_ - as well as the coconut (see ch.12, figure 12.1), the candlenut, _Aleurites moluccana_ ([ch.13, §3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-13)), the macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia, and the almond proper, _Prunus_ dulcis. Fleshy fruits like the peach, _P. persica_, the plum, _P. domestica_, the apricot, _P. armeniaca_, the ocean lychee, _Pometia pinnata_ ([§3 .5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5#cldf:3-11)) and mangoes, _Mangifera_ spp. ([§3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:3-11)), are also drupes, but the fleshy mesocarp is eaten, not the endocarp and seed. Some 'nuts', like the Brazil nut, Bertholletia excelsa, and the canarium nut, _Canarium indicum_, are simply seeds.


<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. _Canarium_ spp. (Burseraceae)


_Canarium_ is one of a suite of plants that were domesticated in the rain forests of northern New Guinea during the early Holocene. Other members of the suite were the breadfruit (_Artocarpus altilis_) and the two fruit trees _Pometia pinnata_ and _Burckella obovata_ ([Yen 1996](Source#cldf:Yen1996)). _Canarium_ is the most important nut-bearing genus in Papua New Guinea, cultivated by almost a third of the rural population ([Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)).

[__Figure 11.1:__ __Left__ _Canarium indicum_: __A__, tree; __B__, portion of leaf showing terminal four leaflets; __C__, portion of branch showing large stipules (leaflike appendages at base of leaf stalk); __D__, immature inflorescence; __E__, cluster of fruit.; __F__, opened pericarp (exocarp + mesocarp + endocarp); __G__, opened shell/endocarp; __H__, edible kernel. __Right__ Parts of the _Canarium indicum_ fruit](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_1)



A number of _Canarium_ species occur today in northwest island Melanesia (eight have been recorded in the Solomons) but only three cultivated species are common within their respective ranges: _Canarium indicum_ (P ngali), _Canarium salomonense_ (P andoa) and _Canarium harveyi_ ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 3).[^1] Of these, only _Canarium indicum_ occurs in New Guinea and the Bismarcks ([Bourke 1996](Source#cldf:Bourke1996)), and was presumably the only common species known to POc speakers before they reached the Solomons. Its range extends from Halmahera to Vanuatu. _Canarium salomonense_ is found in Bougainville and the Solomons and in New Guinea, but not in the Bismarcks. _Canarium harveyi_ apparently originated on Santa Cruz Island as the result of selection and has spread eastward to Tikopia, Anuta, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Niue ([Leenhouts 1959](Source#cldf:Leenhouts1959),[Yen 1996](Source#cldf:Yen1996)). [^2]


<a id="p-314"></a>

_Canarium indicum_ grows to a height of 15-30 m and in the wild is one of the smaller trees of the rain forest canopy. The fruit is a drupe with an oily edible kernel. The skin (exocarp) of the fruit is green when unripe, black when ripe. The ripe flesh (mesocarp) is edible but astringent and deteriorates rapidly. Inside the flesh is the shell (endocarp) and inside the shell is the edible kernel consisting usually of two seeds, each enclosed in its own skin (testa), which is peeled off before the seeds are eaten ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 6; see [Figure 11.1](#fig-3-11_1)).

Particular tree species display considerable variation in their forms, and this variation reflects the time depth of cultivation and domestication. Thus round fruit predominate in Vanuatu, oval fruit in the Solomons. Nuts may contain one kernel or two, which may be white or yellow. The rhythm of flowering, which can be altered by vigorous pruning, varies so that trees can be harvested at different times. _Canarium indicum_ trees are usually individually owned and in some areas are tended where they have grown naturally in the forest. In the Solomons most are planted near villages. _Canarium salomonense_ is usually a cultivated tree. Solomon Islanders consider _Canarium indicum_ to require more light than _Canarium salomonense_, and hence more attention has to be paid to clearing other trees around it ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 40). [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 153) report that in Vanuatu spontaneously germinated seedlings or fully ripened fruits are sometimes planted in gardens or villages.

_Canarium indicum_ and _Canarium salomonense_ are especially valued for their oily nuts and there is evidence that this was already true in POc times ([ch.2, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-2)). _Canarium_ nuts are broken open with a stone. Along the northeast coast of New Guinea, in the Bismarcks, in Bougainville and in the Solomons, their kernels are eaten raw or smoked, or the smoked nuts are pounded with sago, bananas or a root crop[^3] to make an oily pudding (POc _&ast;puro-ŋ_, [ch.12, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-12)) ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 123-124, [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):281, [Bourke 1996](Source#cldf:Bourke1996), Kwa'ioloa&Burt2001: 102). A Takia speaker once described the pudding to me as 'pork when there is no pig': it is presented to honoured guests. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 128, 133) says it is 'a very important food, as much now as in the old days' in Marovo, where traditionally the first puddings were presented to spirits. Similarly on Small Malaita and Ulawa there were ceremonies associated with the first nuts: on Small Malaita this occurred with the first harvest in early August, on Ulawa when the first smoked nuts are ready. In both cases a priest sacrificed nuts and pudding to the ancestors ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927): 367-369). On Choiseul _Canarium salomonense_ has been elevated to a high level of spiritual significance manifested in a variety of practices ([McClatchey et al. 2006a](Source#cldf:McClatcheyetal2006a) ). The cultural importance of _Canarium_ is seen in the Marovo term _buruburu_ '_Canarium_ spp. (generic)', which is also used for 'year', the interval between two ripenings of canarium nuts ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 107).

Among the Kwara'ae _Canarium_ wood is regarded as unsuitable for building, as it becomes worm-eaten ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 103), but [Powell](Source#cldf:Powell1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)) reports that the Bola use it for canoe hulls and building materials. The Kwara'ae use its resin for caulking cracks in canoes.

_Canarium harveyi_ is almost identical in appearance to _Canarium salomonense_ and was earlier thought to be a variety of the latter. _Canarium salomonense_ is dioecious, whereas _Canarium harveyi_ is polygamodioecious, presumably as a result of selection ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 59). Both are similar in appearance to _Canarium indicum_.[^4] The shell of a _Canarium salomonense_ nut cracks into two halves when it is hammered, whereas the shell of _Canarium indicum_ shatters. Both are processed and eaten in much the same ways ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945); [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 104).


<a id="p-315"></a>

Of the three terms reconstructed below, POc _&ast;[ka]ŋaRi_ was almost certainly the term for _Canarium indicum_ as well as the generic term for _Canarium_ species.[^5]

Note that the initial syllable of _&ast;[ka]ŋaRi_ is reflected only in Admiralties, North New Guinea and Papuan Tip languages (and perhaps in Raga and Namakir), whereas Meso-Melanesian and Eastern Oceanic reflexes point to _&ast;ŋaRi_. This distribution justifies the reconstruction of POc forms with and without initial _&ast;ka-_, which may represent or have been reanalysed as the prefix _&ast;ka-_ 'tree' reflecting earlier _&ast;kayu_ 'tree' ([ch.2, §7.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-2#cldf:3-2)). Bola _taŋari_ may reflect the addition of an otherwise unknown prefix _ta-_ to _&ast;ŋaRi_.

Marshallese _kaŋal_ '_Pisonia grandis_' looks as if it is a borrowing from a language retaining initial _ka-_, i.e. Admiralties or Western Oceanic, but on current knowledge of Oceanic settlement history it is difficult to see how this could have occurred.

[PCEMP &ast;_ka(n,ŋ)aRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-1-315-POc-kaari-a)


<a id="p-316"></a>

The denotatum of PWOc _&ast;pinuaq_ is not clear, as the one Papuan Tip witness is glossed '_Terminalia catappa_', the Meso-Melanesian witnesses all 'canarium almond', presumably _Canarium indicum_. It is possible - but not probable - that lthe items listed below reflect POc _&ast;pinu(q)an_ '_Macaranga_ spp.' ([§2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:3-11)) with a change in denotatum.

[PWOc &ast;_pinuaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-1-316-PWOc-pinuaq-a)

The POc reconstructions _&ast;(q)alipa_ and _&ast;lalipa_ are problematic both semantically and formally. The nut described in the Drehet gloss is not readily recognisable; the Mangap reflex is glossed _Terminalia catappa_, the Kwara'ae _Inocarpus fagifer_, and the rest, all NNG or MM, 'canarium almond'. The principal formal difficulty is the initial consonant. Drehet has accreted _n-_, reflecting the PAdm article _&ast;na_, and points to POc initial _&ast;q-_ or the absence of an initial consonant ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988): 340-341), i.e. _&ast;(q)alip_, as do the Tami and Numbami reflexes. The other North New Guinea forms and Kwara'ae (SES) reflect a variant _&ast;lalip_. The Minigir and Tolai reflexes reflect a variant in _g-_, rather than expected †_k-_ reflecting _&ast;q-_. Finally, the Drehet, Mangap and Tolai forms point to the presence of a final vowel, and Tolai attests to _-a_,[^6] but Kwara'ae unexpectedly lacks the final syllable. If this term did indeed denote the canarium nut, then it may be that cultivars of this culturally significant item have been propagated from one location to another, and the term for them has been borrowed at the same time.


<a id="p-317"></a>

[POc &ast;_(q)alipa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-1-317-POc-qalipa-a)

[Kwa'ioloa and Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 119) note that Kwara'ae _lali_ is also used for 'kidney'. However, the semantic extension is from 'nut' to 'kidney', not vice versa, as the use of 'nut' words for kidneys is quite common, e.g. Arosi _kora i mabʷe_ 'kidneys' (lit. 'fruit of Tahitian chestnut' ), Niuean _fua-ifi_ 'kidney' (lit. 'fruit of Tahitian chestnut').


<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. _Inocarpus fagifer_, Tahitian chestnut, Pacific chestnut, Polynesian chestnut, TP _aila_, B _namambe_ (Fabaceae)


<a id="fig-3-11_2"> </a>

[__Figure 11.2:__ _Inocarpus fagifer_, Tahitian chestnut: __A__, tree; __B__, portion of branch bearing fruit; __C__, inflorescence.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_2)



_Inocarpus fagifer_ is a common second storey tree of the foreshore or lowland forest, reaching 15-30 m in height in the Bismarcks but shorter on islands further east. Its trunk is straight and fluted ([Figure 11.2](#fig-3-11_2)). Its fruit is a pod about 8cm long which does not release its single white seed, which must be cooked to be palatable. The enormous variety of its forms reflects the fact that it has long been cultivated ([Bourke & Allen](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming) ([forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)) report that it is cultivated by a sixth of Papua New Guinea's rural population). Leaves may be elongated and narrow or oblong and wide. The fruit may be rounded, crescent-shaped or elongated-oval and green, brown or yellow ([Walter & Sam2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 183-184). Right across Oceania it is either boiled or roasted like a chestnut ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19-21, S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001), [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 183, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). Hence the English term 'Tahitian chestnut'. It is then either eaten without further treatment, or in the Solomons and Fiji grated on coral and made into bread or pudding ([Capell 1941](Source#cldf:Capell1941), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 245, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 185). In parts of Vanuatu it is a major alternative food between the two yam seasons, and the nuts are stored in various ways ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 185).


<a id="p-318"></a>

The cooked seed varies in taste and villagers choose trees according to the taste of their seeds. The tree spreads naturally and prolifically and is then often carefully protected. Seedlings that grow around the base of the trunk are left in place if the tree is little used, but removed from others so that fallen fruit can be harvested more easily. In Vanuatu seedlings of trees bearing fruit preferred by villagers are transplanted close to the village, but this seems to occur less commonly in the Solomons ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 184--185).

On Lihir the leaves of _Inocarpus fagifer_ are used to parcel up food for cooking in a stone oven (S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001)). The wood is brittle and susceptible to borers and in general little used, but in Fiji and Tonga tool handles are made from the flutes of its trunk ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 186, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

Blust (ACD) argues that [Dempwolff](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938)) confused reflexes of POc _&ast;qipil_ 'ironwood, _Intsia bijuga_' (ch.7, 4.9) with those of POc _&ast;ipi_ 'Tahitian chestnut, _Inocarpus fagifer_'. The difference between the two denotata, he suggests, justifies separate reconstructions. He is certainly right, as Marovo has distinct reflexes of the two terms, respectively _kivili_ and _ivi_.[^7]

[Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1929) ([1929](Source#cldf:Ivens1929)) assumes that Sa'a (SES) _mapʷe_ '_Inocarpus fagifer_' is a borrowing from Mota, but this supposition seems unnecessary.

The Tahitian reflex above is glossed 'kidney' as well as '_Inocarpus fagifer_', and the Rapanui reflex denotes only 'kidney'. As noted in [§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-11), there is a tendency for names of nuts also to be used as (or as part of) the term for the kidney.


<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. _Barringtonia_ spp. other than _Barringtonia asiatica_, cutnut, bush nut, TP _pao_, B _navele_ (Lecythidaceae)


The genus _Barringtonia_ has a number of species (see also [ch.5, §5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-5)), but only three have edible nuts: _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ (syn. _Barringtonia oblongifolia_, _Barringtonia brosimos_), _Barringtonia procera_ (syn. _Barringtonia magnifica_, _B. excelsa_, _Barringtonia schuchardtiana_, _Barringtonia guppyana_) and _Barringtonia edulis_ (syn. _Barringtonia calyptrata_, _B. excelsa_, _Barringtonia samoensis_, _Barringtonia seaturae_). They are small trees, growing to between 7 and 20m, which fruit 2-3 times a year, producing a fruit with a fleshy exocarp, a thin fibrous mesocarp and a thin, hard endocarp, within which is a large oily seed with a thin, minutely hairy skin ([Figure 11.3](#fig-3-11_3)).[^8] The seed is edible raw or cooked ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 12-17, 31, 44, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). _Barringtonia_ species with edible nuts grow today in villages on northeast mainland New Guinea and in the Bismarcks, the Solomons and in Vanuatu.

[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 397) says that the seeds of _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ are superior to those of _Barringtonia procera_. Otherwise the three species are very similar and are sometimes confused in botanical reports. [Jebb](Source#cldf:Jebb1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Jebb1992)) provides a careful and relatively recent study of the edible species, and the synonyms above are based on his listing. There are numerous cultivars, and this has led to the proliferation of synonyms as well as confusions about which species a given cultivar represents. [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 38) comments that in indigenous Solomons taxonomies _Barringtonia edulis_ is often classified with _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_.


<a id="p-320"></a>

<a id="fig-3-11_3"> </a>

[__Figure 11.3:__ _Barringtonia edulis_, cut nut: __A__, tree; __B__, flowering shoot; __C__, flower; __D__, portion of string of fruit; __E__, longitudinal section of ripe fruit and edible kernel (from [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 62), __F__, detailed longitudinal section of fruit; __G__, transverse section of fruit.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_3)



Of the three species, it seems probable that only _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ was present in the Bismarcks in early Oceanic times, although, like _Barringtonia edulis_, it is only a minor food source in present-day Papua New Guinea. It is the only species of the three which grows wild in the forests of Papua New Guinea ([Jebb 1992](Source#cldf:Jebb1992)), and it is also the species which [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 397) reports as being tended or planted in gardens and around villages in New Ireland for its edible seeds.

All three species grow wild in the forests of the Solomon Islands, often in wet places. _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ is more likely to grow wild (it is considered to be the most shade-tolerant of the three species), whilst _Barringtonia procera_ and _Barringtonia edulis_ are more likely to grow near villages where they are often transplanted to groves along with _Canarium_ trees ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999):40-41, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 146).

Nut and fruit trees      3 21

[Jebb](Source#cldf:Jebb1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Jebb1992)) reports that wild specimens of _Barringtonia procera_ have only been found in the Solomons. Cultivated varieties of _Barringtonia procera_ abound in the Solomons and Vanuatu, suggesting that it has long been domesticated there ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 118). Indeed, local informants told [Yen](Source#cldf:Yen1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Yen1996)) that _Barringtonia procera_ originated on Santa Cruz Island in the extreme east of the Solomons, and he appears to entertain this possibility. Thus it seems to have been transported from the Solomons and Bougainville to New Ireland and thence to the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain and the Admiralties ([Bourke 1996](Source#cldf:Bourke1996)), perhaps in the last thousand years. The fact that it had not spread to the rest of New Britain or to New Guinea by 1870 suggests that its spread occurred later rather than earlier.[^9] J. Kennedy's (pers. comm.) informants in the Admiralties regard _Barringtonia procera_ as old there, and [Bourke](Source#cldf:Bourkeforthcoming) ([forthcoming](Source#cldf:Bourkeforthcoming)) regards it as a pre-contact introduction. If this reconstruction of events is correct, then it may be that _Barringtonia procera_ displaced earlier _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ cultivation in the Bismarcks.[^10]

Peekel apparently did not find _Barringtonia edulis_ in New Ireland during his work, which predated the second World War. On the other hand, in Fiji it is the only edible _Barringtonia_ species and grows wild in both open and dense forest (it is rarely cultivated there; [Jebb 1992](Source#cldf:Jebb1992)). It also grows in the wild and occurs in many varieties in the Solomons and Vanuatu, indicating a long cultivation history ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 112-113). These facts suggest that _Barringtonia edulis_ may have been brought to the Bismarcks very recently.

These considerations influence the interpretation and glossing of the reconstructions below. Only one POc term, _&ast;pala(ŋ)_, can be convincingly reconstructed for edible _Barringtonia_, and it is a reasonable inference that it denoted _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_. Peekel reports two varieties in New Ireland: the more desirable variety has fruit 'blackish-purple to wine-red ', the other pale green. In Patpatar, the red variety is called _paua kubar_, the green _paua pala_.[^11] It is thus possible that POc _&ast;pala(ŋ)_ denoted the green variety.

The final _&ast;-(ŋ)_ is added on the basis of Kara _falaŋ_. However, the absence of a reflex in other Meso-Melanesian languages, where a final-consonant reflex is expected, makes its reconstruction doubtful.

[PEOc &ast;_pala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-3-322-PEOc-pala-a)

Also seemingly reconstructable on the basis of the cognate set below is POc _&ast;pele_, but the fact that it differs from POc _&ast;pala(ŋ)_ only in its vowels suggests that some or all of the terms in the set reflect borrowings associated with the westward expansion of either _Barringtonia procera_ or _Barringtonia edulis_. Additionally problematic are the fact that the two terms found in New Britain (Nakanai, Meramera _uele_) denote other nut trees and not a _Barringtonia_ sp., and the fact that they reflect POc initial _&ast;w-_ rather than _&ast;p-_.

[3-11-2-3-322-mm-nakanai-uele](cf.csv#cldf:3-11-2-3-322-mm-nakanai-uele)

Although _&ast;kinu_ 'edible _Barringtonia_ species' has reflexes in both Meso-Melanesian and SE Solomonic languages, the members of the set are spread across the border between Western and Eastern Oceanic, so borrowing is more probable than shared inheritance from POc.

### 2.4. _Terminalia_ spp. (Combretaceae)


A number of _Terminalia_ species have edible 'nuts', but only two are reported to be planted in NW Island Melanesia. They are _Terminalia catappa_ (sea almond, Indian almond, Java almond, TP talis, P alite, B natavoa) and _Terminalia kaernbachii_ (okari nut, B natalie).[^12] _Terminalia catappa_ is distributed from southern India to Polynesia, but _Terminalia kaernbachii_ occurs indigenously only in New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago ([Bourke 1996](Source#cldf:Bourke1996), [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 260). Several other species with edible nuts occur in NW Island Melanesia but are only harvested from the wild (_Terminalia copelandii_, _Terminalia impediens_; [Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 123-124), and yet other species have fruits with edible flesh (_Terminalia megalocarpa__, syn. _T. solomonensis_, _T. lapalagon_). Several _Terminalia_ species found indigenously in the Solomons provide good timber: _Terminalia brassii_, T. calamansanai and _Terminalia sepicana_ ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 10--11).


<a id="p-324"></a>

_Terminalia catappa_ is a stout broad tree growing to 10-25 m, with a short, often twisted, easily climbed bole. It prefers moister environments, is a common foreshore tree in New Guinea and the Bismarcks, and grows along the coastal strip up to an altitude of 300 m. It also grows in the floodplain forests and streambanks of Bougainville ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):403, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 60, [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)). Its leaves turn red and fall about four times a year, providing a calendrical marker in lagoon environments in Fiji. The fruit of _Terminalia catappa_ has a thin, fleshy exocarp covering a fibrous mesocarp fused with a thick, hard, irregular endocarp (the stone), within which is an edible seed with an almond-like taste enclosed in a red skin (testa) ([Figure 11.4](#fig-3-11_4)), eaten raw or roasted ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 12-13).

_Terminalia kaernbachii_ is more slender and has thinner branches than _Terminalia catappa_. It is also taller, growing to 20-40 m ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):403, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 41). Its fruit is the largest known among the Combretaceae and contains a large edible seed which ranges in weight from 1.5 to 10 g. Its distribution is quite different from the coastal _Terminalia catappa_. It prefers instead inland environments up to an altitude of 1100 m with a greater diurnal temperature range. Until recently its distribution in the Bismarcks was limited to the extreme west of New Britain and to Manus Island in the Admiralties ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):260, [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming), pers. comm.). Unfortunately, _Terminalia kaernbachii_ has received relatively little attention in the literature, partly perhaps because of its restricted distribution and partly because it is overshadowed by the better known and far more widespread _Terminalia catappa_.

The literature also attributes little importance to _Terminalia catappa_, but this reflects a decline in its consumption since European contact. In the Solomons and Fiji the nuts tend to be eaten raw as snacks and collected by children, but they are not (or no longer?) used in cooking. [Paijmans](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 123-124) and R.M. Bourke (pers. comm.) report that it is often planted and is a common village shade tree in New Guinea and the Bismarcks. [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 255) say that _Terminalia catappa_ nuts are sometimes preserved by smoking in New Britain and Bougainville. The situation in Vanuatu is ambiguous. [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 255) report that _Terminalia catappa_ is largely spread by birds and bats, and little cultivated, but the fact that there are many varieties there may point to past selection through planting.

In Vanuatu and on Waya (Fiji) the wood of _Terminalia catappa_ was carved. In Vanuatu it is also used for canoes and for the frameworks of buildings ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):255-256, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). In Marovo juice squeezed from the leaves makes a medicine against various pains including toothache. Bark scrapings wrapped in leaves and heated over a fire are squeezed to produce a liquid given to children who have a sore throat, cough or diarrhoea, and it has similar uses in Vanuatu ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):256, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 145).

Comments in the agronomic literature about the relative insignificance of _Terminalia catappa_ are belied by the fact that there is a term with very widespread reflexes, namely POc _&ast;talise_. The denotatum of reflexes from New Guinea and the Bismarcks is usually noted simply as '_Terminalia_ sp.', but it is a reasonable inference that reflexes from coastal locations in New Guinea, from New Britain and New Ireland and from small islands all denote _Terminalia catappa_ (R.M. Bourke, pers. comm.) and that this was the denotatum of POc _&ast;talise_. If this interpretation is correct, then no term for _Terminalia kaernbachii_ is reconstructable on the basis of the available data.

[PMP &ast;_talisay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-4-324-POc-talise-a)


<a id="p-325"></a>


<a id="p-326"></a>

Two other POc terms possibly denoted _Terminalia_ species: _&ast;tapoRa_ and _&ast;qatV_. The POc denotatum of _&ast;tapoRa_ is unclear. In PEOc it evidently denoted a species of _Terminalia_, possibly _Terminalia catappa_,[^13] but the glosses of the Takia and Nehan reflexes make it impossible to determine its POc denotation.

[POc &ast;_tapoRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-2-4-326-POc-tapora-a)

The set below appears to reflect a POc _&ast;qatV_. Superficially Nehan _kasasas_ appears cognate, but it is at best a borrowed reflex. The expected Nehan reflex would be _&ast;ata_: Nehan _k-_ and _-s-_ reflect POc _&ast;k_ and _&ast;s_ respectively. _Terminalia complanata_ and _Terminalia sepicana_ are both uncultivated edible species, the nuts of which are occasionally consumed as snacks, and so the gloss '_Terminalia_ sp. with edible nut' is well enough supported.

### 2.5. _Pandanus_ spp., screw pines (Pandanaceae)


_Pandanus_ trees are an easily recognised feature in the forests of NW Island Melanesia. All species have aerial roots and very large thick leaves. The leaves of some species serve on canoes as sails, awnings, deck-houses, bailers and in houses as roofing, mats and wall lining. Sewn leaves are used for rain capes. POc _&ast;qebal_ 'pandanus mat' is reconstructed in [vol. 1, ch.4, §3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:1-4). The fruits of all species are syncarps, compound fruits with many segments, each a drupe, arranged around a core, and the fruits and/or seeds of various species are a source of food. Recognition of the various species, however, is much more difficult, partly because of intra-species variability which is at least partly the result of cultivation. [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 161-163) remarks that there is much confusion in the Linnaean naming of _Pandanus_ species, and [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 80, 232-236) do not provide names for the Solomons species they describe. Our sources are also often vague in their glosses of terms for pandanus types. Consequently it is possible that there are inaccuracies here. The four species for which POc terms can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty are:[^16]

- _Pandanus tectorius_, the coastal pandanus: the most widespread and most exploited species throughout Oceania; its leaves are used for making mats;
- _Pandanus dubius_: it is widely distributed and remarkable for the size and strength of its leaves.
- _Pandanus conoideus_, with its long red or yellow fruit (Tok Pisin _marita_), a salient species in New Guinea but not common in the Bismarcks;
- _Pandanus lamekotensis_: seemingly restricted to the Admiralties and to northern and central New Ireland, but a POc term for it is reconstructable.

All except _Pandanus dubius_ are sources of food, and the third and fourth are cultivated. Although _Pandanus dubius_ is not a food source, I have included it here in order to keep the genus together.


<a id="s-2-5-1"></a>

#### 2.5.1. _Pandanus tectorius_ (syn. _Pandanus odoratissimus_), coastal pandanus (Pandanaceae)


_Pandanus tectorius_ usually grows just behind the shore line to a height of 5-10 m. Its leaves are 1-2 m long, flat sheets tapering to a point. The orange fruit is made up of 'fingers' 6--8 em long, 4--5cm wide, each consisting of 8--17 parallel nuts ([Figure 11.5](#fig-3-11_5), left). The species shows considerable variability, consistent with having been cultivated over a long period of time, and is often found near villages and old village sites ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):38, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 216--217). In NW Island Melanesia its use is patchy: it is used in Manus, the south coast of New Britain, in New Ireland and in Bougainville ([Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)).[^17]


<a id="p-328"></a>

Selection has resulted in cultivars with thick but pliable leaves with edges free from spines, which serve as rain hoods and are used for making mats and baskets. In Vanuatu baskets are made from leaves softened in the fire, cut into narrow strips, steeped in water, then bleached and dried in the sun ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 216-217).

The alimentary use of _Pandanus tectorius_ is less significant than uses of its leaves, but it is reported from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa. The ripe globular fruit are sucked to obtain a sweet juice, perhaps more by children than by adults. This practice may have been far more common in the past, before the arrival of sweetened soft drinks ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):217, [Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)). On Waya (Fiji) the juice was famine food ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 88) reports that the ends of the aerial roots are baked and eaten in some Micronesian and Polynesian societies, especially in atoll communities, where its fruits are also an important food source.

On Waya the trunks are used for house rafters and leaves for thatching ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

POc _&ast;padran_ appears to have specifically denoted _Pandanus tectorius_, but was evidently also used as a generic for pandanus species. POc _&ast;kiRe_ and _&ast;poipoi_ probably denoted only _Pandanus tectorius_ or perhaps certain cultivars of _Pandanus tectorius_.

#### 2.5.2. _Pandanus dubius_ (syn. _Pandanus compressus_) (Pandanaceae)


Nut and fruit trees      3 31

_Pandanus dubius_ is a coastal species distributed from the Philippines southeastward as far as Vanuatu, where it is sometimes cultivated. It is the pandanus species with the broadest and stiffest leaves in the Bismarcks, 2 m or more in length and up to 16cm wide. The syncarps are made up of fingers 10-13cm long, 5-9cm wide, angular, but unlike other species not grooved ([Figure 11.5](#fig-3-11_5), right)[^19] ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 41, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 212-213).

The fruiting spike is edible but rarely eaten, [Sorensen](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950) ([1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950)) reports for the Ninigos and [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 212) for Vanuatu. The leaves are used for thatching, and with the spiny parts removed dried leaves are sewn together as mats and large baskets ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 41).

The POc term for _Pandanus dubius_ was _&ast;pakum_.[^20]

<a id="s-2-5-3"></a>

#### 2.5.3. _Pandanus conoideus_, red fruit pandanus, TP marita (Pandanaceae)


_Pandanus conoideus_ is a small tree, 4-7 m high, found in New Guinea, from the coasts up to an altitude of 2000 m.It is less common in the Bismarcks. It grows in damp, shady places around villages and on old village sites, and displays the variability typical of cultivation. Its trunk is covered in short sharp spikes, and the long leaves have spiked edges. Its syncarps are typically 20-40cm long, and sometimes reach 1 m and weigh as much as 10 kg. The fruit are bright red or occasionally yellow, and get their colour from the oil in the pericarp ([Figure 11.6](#fig-3-11_6)) ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986):210, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 210--211.)


<a id="p-332"></a>

The fruit are prized as a foodstuff and widely consumed. They are typically split, wrapped in leaves and cooked in an earth oven or roasted over a fire. The pulp and seeds are removed from the core, mashed with water and strained to produce a thick, rich red sauce with which other foods are seasoned ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950), [Barrau 1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 163, [May 1984](Source#cldf:May1984), [Bourke in preparation](Source#cldf:Bourkeinpreparation)).

<a id="fig-3-11_6"> </a>

[__Figure 11.6:__ _Pandanus conoideus_, marita: __A__, syncarp.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_6)



POc _&ast;mʷafia_ apparently denoted _Pandanus conoideus_.[^21] This reconstruction is open to doubt, as there are no reflexes from New Ireland or New Britain, where the species is rare, and only one from mainland New Guinea. It is possible that Maisin _moŋgi_ '_Pandanus_ sp.' and PMic _&ast;maŋu_ 'pandanus leaf' are also cognate. If so, they reflect a POc form in which _&ast;-ñ-_ has been replaced by _&ast;-ŋ-_.

Another interpretation of the data is also possible, namely that the items listed below, other than Arosi _mʷa-mʷana_, reflect POc _&ast;moñak_ 'fat, oil, coconut cream; tasty' ([ch.12, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-12)), since the fruit of _Pandanus conoideus_ are both oily and tasty. If this were so, then Arosi _mʷa-mʷana_ and the items listed under 'cf. also' would probably reflect a PEOc _&ast;mʷaŋV_ 'pandanus leaf.

#### 2.5.4. _Pandanus lamekotensis_ (Pandanaceae)


[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 41) remarks that _Pandanus lamekotensis_ is readily distinguished from other species. However, I have otherwise found it mentioned only by [Kennedy & Clarke](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)), who provide no additional information, and it is possible that its distribution is limited to New Ireland. Indeed, Peekel did not find it in the south of New Ireland or on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain. It grows only on swampy creek banks, 4--7 m high with from 5 to 8 leaves, and its fruit clusters are oval, not 'fingers'. The ripe fruits, like those of _Pandanus tectorius_ are sometimes sucked by New Ireland villagers.

### 2.6. _Sterculia vitiensis_ (syn. _Sterculia tannaensis_) (Sterculiaceae)


In a sense _Sterculia vitiensis_ does not belong here, as it was not known to POc speakers. There are a number of small species of _Sterculia_ in the Bismarcks and Solomons, but _Sterculia vitiensis_ is a large canopy tree, up to 30m tall. It is found in the central and especially the southern islands of Vanuatu and in Fiji.


<a id="p-335"></a>

It is planted for its edible seeds (its wood is soft and not durable). The fruit is a large (9 x 7 cm) hollow capsule, light yellowish green when it is ripe, with a groove down one side which splits open to reveal a vermilion interior and a row of elongate (1-2 cm) glossy black seeds along the split edges. _Sterculia vitiensis_ is not particularly abundant, and tends to be found in locations associated with human activity. The ripe seeds are grilled either in their shells or separately ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 230, 232, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 247-248).

Although the seeds of other species are sometimes eaten in the Bismarcks ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)), the only reconstructable name for a _Sterculia_ species is, as one might expect, a PROc etymon, _&ast;wasi-wasi_ '_Sterculia vitiensis_'. There is a formally identical POc etymon, POc _&ast;wasi-wasi_ '_Abroma augusta_'. _Abroma augusta_ is a small shrub ([ch.7, §6.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-1-1#cldf:3-7)) and _Sterculia vitiensis_ a large tree, so it is not clear whether the two terms were innovated independently or have a common origin.

<a id="s-2-7"></a>

### 2.7. _Pangium edule_, pangi, ankle-rattle tree, TP _sis_, _solomon_, B _navangge_, _nalake_ (Flacourtiaceae)


_Pangium edule_ is included in this section because it is a cultivated tree ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 384, [Kennedy & Clarke 2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)) and produces a fruit the flesh of which is eaten in some places. It is not a major food source.

The tree grows 25-30 m tall, with 3-5 triangular buttresses up to 1 m in height. Leaves are arranged in spirals at the ends of branches. The fruit of wild trees contains cyanogenetic glucosides and is poisonous, but the fruit of cultivated trees is edible ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 384). The fruit, up to 15 cm long with a rough brown skin, is enclosed in a bright yellow mesocarp and green skin. It contains a number of red-brown seeds, each in its own very hard case, surrounded by a soft yellow strong-smelling pulp ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 193, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19).

<a id="fig-3-11_7"> </a>

[__Figure 11.7:__ _Pangium edule_](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_7)




<a id="p-336"></a>

The seed is buried for 2-3 weeks in beach sand or soaked in fresh or salt water to make it edible, then roasted and fermented ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 384, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 121, [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)). The Sengseng of New Britain trade it as a delicacy (A. Chowning, pers. comm.). The practice of eating the seeds extends eastward as far as Marovo ([Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999):21), but Hviding does not mention their consumption. The seeds are a famine food in Vanuatu ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 47).

A well known use of _Pangium edule_ seed cases in the Bismarcks, the Solomons and Vanuatu is in the manufacture of bangles and rattles for traditional dances. In the Solomons the leaves are heated in the fire and used to kill headlice. The wood is generally not regarded as suitable for construction ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):246, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 121).

The only reconstructable term for _Pangium edule_ is PEOc _&ast;paRage_. Given that the tree is present in the Bismarcks, it seems odd that no POc or PWOc term can be reconstructed, but this may be due to the absence of relevant data from the sources.

### 3.1. _Burckella obovata_ (syn. _Bassia erskineana_, _Payena mentzelii_, _Illipe hollrungii_), red silkwood, TP _bukabuk_, B _naduldule_, _nandunde_ (Sapotaceae)



<a id="p-337"></a>

_Burckella obovata_ tends to grow on smaller islands. It occurs on the small islands west of Manus in the Admiralties, in New Ireland, in the island groups north and east of New Ireland, on the Duke of York Islands between New Britain and New Ireland, and on Buka and nearby small islands in Bougainville Province. It is also found in the Solomons on Malaita and in the Temotu Islands (and [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 111 reports its presence at Marovo) and in Vanuatu ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124, [Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)). It is a tree of medium size, about 20--30 m. tall, with a massive trunk 1-3m in diameter at the base and white flowers that have a strong, somewhat sickening scent. It has large edible fruit that has a rose-petal-like smell and is consumed uncooked. In Vanuatu there are two main types of fruit: a more common elongated type, reputed to be sweeter, and a round, sometimes very large type. The latter has two subtypes, wrinkled and smooth. The smooth subtype is apparently the outcome of selection, and is always cultivated. In the Solomons and Vanuatu the fruit is harvested before it is ripe in order to beat the fruit bats ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 125). Two varieties grow in Marovo, wild and planted. Coconut crabs eat the fruit of the wild variety ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 111).

In the Solomons and Vanuatu the wood is used for crossbeams in houses, for outrigger booms and for canoe paddles ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):55, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 125). In Marovo it was formerly used for the keels of war canoes and is still sometimes used for making dugouts ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 111).

The POc form _&ast;ñatu_ was first reconstructed by [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1978b) ([1978b](Source#cldf:Blust1978b)) as an unnamed but described tree type. Further reflexes indicate that this is _Burckella obovata_, to which [Gowers](Source#cldf:Gowers1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 38) gives the English designation 'red silkwood'. Evidence for POc _&ast;-q_ is provided by Sye _yetu_ and Ura _ni-yere_ (John Lynch, pers. comm.), where preservation of the final vowel reflects the earlier presence of _&ast;-q_.

The gloss of PMP _&ast;ñatuq_ below, 'a hardwood tree taxon, including at least _Palaquium_ spp.', is inferred from the glosses of Blust's supporting data. Species of _Burckella_ and _Palaquium_ and perhaps other genera seem to have been included in a single taxon throughout Oceanic history (see the discussion associated with PCP &ast;bau 'hardwood taxon' in [ch.7, §4.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-10#cldf:3-7)).

### 3.2. _Clymenia polyandra_ and _Citrus_ spp. (Rutaceae)


[Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1955) ([1955](Source#cldf:Barrau1955): 85) considers that all edible species of the genus _Citrus_ were introduced to Melanesia by Europeans, and R. M. Bourke's (pers. comm.) research confirms this. We would not therefore expect to find a reconstructable POc term meaning 'citrus'. But the reconstruction of POc _&ast;molis_ 'citrus fruit' is well-supported ([Lynch 1984](Source#cldf:Lynch1984)), and its reflexes are today used in many languages for several citrus species.

How are we to explain this? There are two possible answers. One is that _&ast;molis_ referred not to _Citrus_ species but to citrus-like fruit indigenous to western Melanesia. [Aburu](Source#cldf:Aburu1982) ([1982](Source#cldf:Aburu1982)) reports on two indigenous citrus-like genera, Clymenia and Microcitrus in Papua New Guinea. [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 232) describes _Clymenia polyandra_ as a '_Citrus_ relative' whose fruit is yellow, the size of a large lime, and in some cases 'sweet and pleasant-tasting'. The tree is 5-8 m tall. It is cultivated in Manus and New Ireland (where it was also recorded by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 272)) and does not occur outside Papua New Guinea.


<a id="p-339"></a>

The alternative answer is that there were inedible or barely edible _Citrus_ species in Melanesia before European contact, which have been largely replaced by imported edible species. A bush lemon, _Citrus_ hystrix, with almost no edible flesh ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 226) may be one of these. We can only infer that POc _&ast;molis_ designated either citrus-like genera or inedible species of _Citrus_, or both.[^24]

### 3.3. _Corynocarpus cribbianus_ (syn. _Corynocarpus australasicus_, _Corynocarpus cribbiana_, _Helicia cribbiana_) (Cocynocarpaceae)


A small fruit tree which was apparently cultivated in the past, _Corynocarpus cribbianus_ is reported from the Admiralties, from offshore islands around Madang (north coast of New Guinea), from Tangga Island (east of New Ireland) and in the Solomons from Guadalcanal and Malaita, but apparently not in New Britain or New Ireland.[^25] It grows to a height of 7-10 m on Tangga Island, but sometimes to 20m elsewhere in Papua New Guinea. The mango-shaped fruit, 10--12cm long and 8-10cm in diameter, grow in clusters at the ends of branches. They are sweet but not juicy, and eaten raw or boiled. Two varieties are reported from Tangga and Kwara'ae: one has red, pear-shaped fruit, the other white and more ovoid. _Corynocarpus cribbianus_ continues to be grown from seed in some places but has become rare in the Solomons, where it was apparently more widely cultivated in the past. Today it is only a snack food for hunters in the forest ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986):234, O' Collins & Lamothe 1989, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 168).

[Yen](Source#cldf:Yen1974a) ([1974a](Source#cldf:Yen1974a)) reports a previously domesticated species of _Corynocarpus_ on Santa Cruz Island (Te Motu group, Solomon Islands). This may well have been _Corynocarpus similis_, which grows wild under the forest canopy in parts of Vanuatu and is cultivated there. Indeed, [Walter and Sam's](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 152-153) description could easily be a description of _Corynocarpus cribbianus_, right down to its two varieties. Today it is regularly eaten only on the Torres Islands, where it was formerly cultivated and the fruits eaten boiled just before they became ripe, and on Tanna. Elsewhere it is a famine food. The wood is used for digging sticks or utensil handles.

POc _&ast;i(u)bu_ '_Corynocarpus cribbianus_' is tentatively reconstructed - 'tentatively' because the forms shown under 'cf. also' appear to be formally connected with the members of this set, suggesting a PEOc _&ast;tabʷV_, but the history of these forms or their relationship to the apparent reflexes of _&ast;i(u)bu_ is unclear.

### 3.4. _Mangifera_ spp., mango (Anacardiaceae)


We cannot be completely sure of the original referents of the five mango terms reconstructed below. When Austronesian speakers arrived in the Bismarcks, they encountered the fibrous and ill-tasting indigenous mangoes _Mangifera minor_ and _Mangifera foetida_. The sweet-tasting _Mangifera indica_, the species widely consumed today, arrived with Europeans after about 1870 ([Bourke forthcoming](Source#cldf:Bourkeforthcoming)).

It is possible that PMP _&ast;pahuq_ referred to _Mangifera indica_ and PMP _&ast;wai_ to other _Mangifera_ species (ACD). I have found only two reflexes of PMP _&ast;pahuq_ in Oceanic languags, namely Vitu _vau_ and Bola _vao_. Vitu (in the French Islands, north of New Britain) is among the most conservative of Oceanic languages, and has remained quite isolated at least since early in the spread of the Western Oceanic dialect network. Bola is close by on New Britain. One may infer that _&ast;pau(q)_ occurred in POc, but not with the gloss '_Mangifera indica_'. It was replaced at a very early stage by _&ast;wai_, as this was the appropriate term for the indigenous (non-indica) species, with _&ast;wai-wai_ perhaps denoting wild varieties ([§7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2#cldf:3-11)). The species _Mangifera minor_ was specifically designated by POc _&ast;koRa_.

_Mangifera minor_, the traditional wild mango indigenous to the Bismarcks, is 10-25 m tall. The introduced _Mangifera indica_ needs a drier period each year to bear, whereas _Mangifera minor_ does not, and so the latter continues to be eaten mainly in locations where _Mangifera indica_ does not bear regularly. It is occasionally cultivated from seed. Its leaves are narrower than those of M . indica ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 326, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986):206--207, [Bourke in preparation](Source#cldf:Bourkeinpreparation), n.d.).

<a id="p-342"></a>

PWOc _&ast;kasuwai_ 'mango' seems to be a compound, with an unidentified element _&ast;kasu-_ and _&ast;wai_ 'mango'. The SE Solomons terms below reflect PSES _&ast;ɣohai_, which in turn reflects a putative POc †_&ast;koyai_. However, PSES _&ast;ɣohai_ probably reflects the borrowing of a reflex of _&ast;kasuwai_, perhaps before the dispersal of PSES, as the terms are regular reflexes of _&ast;ɣohai_.

### 3.5. _Pometia pinnata_, ocean lychee, island lychee, TP _ton_, _taun_, P _obit_, _inkori_, B _nandao_ (Sapindaceae)


_Pometia pinnata_, an ancient New Guinea domesticate ([Yen 1996](Source#cldf:Yen1996)), is a tall canopy hardwood tree of 20--45 m ([Figure 11.9](#fig-3-11_9), left). [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 335) writes that its fruit, green or red and 4--6cm in diameter, the sweet pulp of which similar in taste and texture to a lychee and is eaten raw, is the most valued in the Bismarck Archipelago after the Malay apple. The skin of the ripe fruit is peeled off like that of a mandarin. The pulp surrounds a seed, up to 3 cm in diameter, which is poisonous and requires extensive processing and cooking before it can be eaten. [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 215) reports that there are also varieties of _Pometia pinnata_ with inedible flesh.

_Pometia pinnata_ displays considerable variety in form, especially in the New Guinea region, attesting to long cultivation. Walter & Sam (20102: 229-230) report that its better forms are often transplanted in the Bismarcks and in Vanuatu but apparently less so in the Solomons. There are also widespread reports that it makes good building timber ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 118, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 215). The wood is also used for carving on Waya ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)), and its plank buttresses provide axe handles in Marovo ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 129).


<a id="p-343"></a>

The POc term for _Pometia pinnata_ was _&ast;tawan_, reflected in all major Oceanic subgroups except Micronesian.

### 3.6. _Spondias cytherea_ (syn. _Spondias dulcis_, _Spondias mangifera_), golden apple, Polynesian plum, hog plum, Tahitian apple, Bnaos (Anacardiaceae)


_Spondias cytherea_ is a lowland sub canopy tree of medium height, 10-25 m. tall, distributed from island SE Asia to western Polynesia, and occurring in several varieties, a probable result of domestication ([Figure 11.9](#fig-3-11_9), right). Within the Bismarcks it occurs mainly in the Admiralties, on Mussau Island and in New Ireland ([Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)). The tree is widely cultivated near villages in the Bismarcks, the Solomons (mainly in the Reeflslands) and Vanuatu, but is also spread by fruit bats ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):47, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):243-244, [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 219).


<a id="p-345"></a>

The mature tree has a long trunk of up to 20 m with large buttresses up to 3 m. Its small white flowers grow in clusters, and it has yellow or orange ellipsoid fruit, up to 7cm long. According to [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 47) there are two varieties. The fruit of one are acidic and bitter, of the other slightly tart but pleasant to eat. The former are baked before eating, whilst the latter are eaten raw. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 135) reports of the second variety that in Marovo the fruit are best eaten when unripe and rather sour. In Vanuatu the fruit are of better quality than in the Bismarcks and the Solomons. They are picked while still green, just before they ripen, and eaten a few days later after they have ripened inside the house.

The wood is too soft for use in buildings, but in Vanuatu it is used to make canoe outriggers. It has a variety of medicinal uses: a decoction from the leaves is used for coughs and other ailments ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 49).

There was a single widely reflected POc term, _&ast;quRis_. I have assumed below that the PCP form was _&ast;wi_, with irregular loss of _&ast;q-_ from expected †_&ast;qul_. However, loss of _&ast;q-_ is regular in Fijian, and so Fijian _wī_ is a regular reflex of either proto form. [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 87) suggests that the PCP form was indeed _&ast;qui_ and that the Polynesian forms reflect borrowing from Fijian - but such a borrowing would have had to occur very early, to find its way to the extremes of Polynesia. It seems more likely that the PCP indeed had _&ast;wī_.

[POc &ast;_quRis_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-3-6-345-POc-quris-a)


<a id="p-346"></a>

In the Bismarcks an imported thorny shrub, _Ximenia americana_ (syn. _X. elliptica_, _X. aculeata_),[^27] is evidently perceived as resembling _Spondias cytherea_, to judge from the names below. The resemblance is based on the fact that _Ximenia americana_ also has edible yellow ellipsoid fruit, but no larger than a cherry ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 160). E Kara combines the POc prefix _&ast;mala-_ 'resembling' ([ch.2, §7.1.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-4#cldf:3-2)) and _ukis_ '_Spondias cytherea_'. The base _ukis_ is the reflex of POc _&ast;quRis_ '_Spondias cytherea_' that would be expected in Tigak, immediately to the north of Kara. Further south, in Patpatar, the term for _Ximenia americana_ is _ku-kuris_, the reduplication implying that _Ximenia americana_ is an inferior or wild version of _Spondias cytherea_ ([ch.2, §7 .2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2#cldf:3-2)).

[3-11-3-6-346-mm-karae-malaukis](cf.csv#cldf:3-11-3-6-346-mm-karae-malaukis)

PNCV _&ast;usi_ below appears to be an irregular reflex of POc _&ast;quRis_. Two possible explanations present themselves. First, _&ast;(q)usi_ is a metathesised reflex of _&ast;quRis_ (> †_&ast;uis_ > _&ast;usi_). Second, although POc final consonants were regularly lost in PNCV, [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark2009) ([2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009)) points to a dozen or so words in which the expected CVCV form exists alongside an extended form CVCVCV, representing the full POc form with an added vowel, most often _&ast;-i_. The extended forms, for which Clark offers no explanation, are found throughout North Vanuatu and north Malakula, but without much consistency in any one language. One of these, in the form he reconstructs, is _&ast;quRisi_, which with regular deletion of POc _&ast;q-_ and _&ast;-R-_ gives _&ast;u(i)si_.

Some of these reflexes are (also) used to denote the pawpaw/papaya, _Carica papaya_, a recent introduction; this reflects a perception in Vanuatu that _Spondias cytherea_ and papaya are similar and somehow related.

[PNCV &ast;_usi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-3-6-346-PNCV-usi-a)


<a id="p-347"></a>

There are two possible external cognates of the PNCV etymon below. The first is Mussau (Adm) _malai_ '_Spondias cytherea_' ([Lepofsky 1992](Source#cldf:Lepofsky1992)). However, Mussau _-ai_ does not correspond regularly with Paamese, Nguna _-i_. The second is Wayan (Fij) _māoli_ '_Spondias cytherea_', but Wayan _-āo-_ does not correspond regularly with PNCV _&ast;-a-_. In parts of northern Vanuatu the term has been reapplied to _Dracontomelon vitiense_ ([ch.7, §4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:3-7)).

[PNCV &ast;_mali_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-11-3-6-347-PNCV-mali-a)

Also puzzling is the connection between PNCV _&ast;mali_ and the items for _Garuga floribunda_ listed below. There is reason to think that this is not a chance resemblance, as the PROc term _&ast;mala-usi_ 'Garuga sp.' literally meant 'like _Spondias cytherea_' ([ch.7, §4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8#cldf:3-7)), i.e. there was/is a perceived resemblance between Garuga and Spondias species. We cannot simply include the items below in the cognate set for PNCV _&ast;mali_ above, however, as the Paamese, Lewo and S Efate reflexes of _&ast;mal-mali_ differ from their reflexes of _&ast;mali_.

### 3.7. _Syzygium malaccense_ (syn. _Eugenia malaccensis_, _Eugenia jambos_, jambosa malaccensis), Malay apple, rose apple, TP _laulau_, P _kabarae_, B _nakavika_ (Myrtaceae)


Many _Syzygium_ species which occur in the Pacific have edible fruit. The most important is _Syzygium malaccense_, which is distributed from SE Asia to Polynesia, but [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 408-415) and [Walter & Sam](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 251-252) list numerous species which occur in NW Island Melanesia.

<a id="fig-3-11_10"> </a>

[__Figure 11.10:__ _Syzygium malaccense_: __A__, tree; __B__, shoot; __C__, branch with opened and unopened flowers; __D__, edible fruit.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-11_10)



_Syzygium malaccense_ is an erect tree of medium height, 5-25 m tall, with spectacular white or pink flowers that look like small powder puffs and ellipsoid two-seeded fruit 4--9cm long that are white, pink or red when they are mature. The fruit approach a European apple in texture, but are often more watery in flavour. They are widely and, to quote Sorensen, 'avidly' consumed throughout the Pacific ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 408, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 250, [Bourke in preparation](Source#cldf:Bourkeinpreparation)). They are eaten fresh, soon after picking. _Syzygium malaccense_ is found around villages and in coconut groves, in gardens and old fallows, and in open forests, although it is not clear whether it is indigenous to Melanesia or whether cultivated varieties have simply propagated themselves into the wild. Transplantation of better forms to village and garden areas is widespread ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 123-124, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 250). The wood is used for buildings in Vanuatu and Fiji, and for canoes in Vanuatu. Juice extracted from the leaves is used for abdominal pains, sore throats, toothache and generally for pain and fever ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 43-44, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 250).

The POc term for _Syzygium malaccense_ was _&ast;kapika_, reflected in all major Oceanic subgroups except Micronesian. It may also have served as a generic for _Syzygium_ species in general.

## 4. Other nut and fruit trees


This section is devoted to nut- or fruit-bearing species that are popularly eaten in at least parts of NW Island Melanesia but for which there is no evidence of arboriculture.

In several cases, the literature on plant food production describes species for which we have been unable to reconstruct a term. These are:

- _Flacourtia rukam_ is a small tree with a twisted trunk and red spherical fruits of 2cm diameter, distributed from island SE Asia to the Solomons but found cultivated further east. The fruit is occasionally eaten ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 173-174, [Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)).
- _Pouteria maclayana_ is a common, self-sown, small, buttressed coastal tree with a bushy crown that grows in New Guinea, on offshore islands along its north coast and in the southeastern Solomon Islands. Its yellow-fleshed fruit, shaped like a flattened sphere, is occasionally eaten raw, in some places as a famine food ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 142-143, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002):233, [Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend) ). [Allen et al.](Source#cldf:Allenetal1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Allenetal1994)) list it among previously important foods on Karkar Island.
- _Castanopsis acuminatissima_ is a tall oak-like tree whose seeds are a traditional forest food, eaten after boiling in New Guinea, New Britain and perhaps parts of the Solomons ([Henty 1982](Source#cldf:Henty1982), [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19).
- _Omphalea gageana_ (syn. 0. papuana, 0. queenslandiae) is an uncommon large woody, high-climbing forest creeper, 20--30 m. long. Its fruit has three seeds enclosed in a thin fleshy mesocarp and a ridged undulating woody shell, which are eaten raw or cooked around the Huon Gulf and in SE Papua ([Henty 1982](Source#cldf:Henty1982), Peekell984: 317, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 76, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19).
- _Gnetum latifolium_ is another large woody, high-climbing forest creeper, 5-20 m long, with yellow-red fruits, the seeds of which are eaten after roasting ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 37, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):78, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 20).

The distributions of some of the above are such that they may have been unknown to speakers of POc, but it is also possible that our sources are not detailed enough to provide us with the data needed to support a reconstruction.

The fruits of several species of _Ficus_ are eaten. [Bourke](Source#cldf:Bourkend) ([n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)) names _Ficus copiosa_, _Ficus tinctoria_ and _Ficus wassa_. These are treated in ch.lO, [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-11).

### 4.1. _Finschia chloroxantha_ (syn. _Finschia waterhousiana_, _Finschia densiflora_, _Grevillea densiflora_) (Proteaceae)


_Finschia chloroxantha_ is a medium-sized lowland rain forest tree with a blackish trunk and stilt roots ([Figure 11.11](#fig-3-11_11), right). When it blooms it makes a spectacular display of bright orange or light golden yellow pendulous flowers. Its seeds are edible, eaten raw as snacks in the Solomons and after cooking in New Guinea. Its red-brown wood is strong and is used for timber, furniture and drums in the Solomons. Its leaves were used to treat sores and ulcers on Santa Isabel ([Henty 1982](Source#cldf:Henty1982), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):74--76, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 124).

The cognate set below allows only a PEOc reconstruction. The one Western Oceanic item, Maringe _ɣlama_, is probably a borrowing from a neighbouring SE Solomonic language, especially as Maringe _ɣl-_ typically reflects POc _&ast;l-_, not _&ast;g-_. The species is not mentioned by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)), a major source of botanical terms from New Ireland.

### 4.2. _Parartocarpus venenosa_ (syn. _Parartocarpus involucrata_) (Moraceae)


_Parartocarpus venenosa_ is a large lowland forest tree growing to about 35m, with girths of over 1.5 m, which resembles the breadfruit ([Figure 11.11](#fig-3-11_11), left) ([ch.9, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-9)). Its fruit is brown or yellow and highly aromatic; it forms an irregularly shaped syncarp about 18cm across, a compound fruit with many segments about 3cm long arranged around the core, and is eaten raw. It is especially popular in New Britain, but there is no record of cultivation. Elsewhere in lowland New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Solomons it is generally less significant but is known and consumed ([Barrau 1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 177, [Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124, [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 132, [Bourke in preparation](Source#cldf:Bourkeinpreparation), [French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 259). [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988)) report that it is not very sweet and has a powdery texture: it is filling but not succulent. Its timber is generally not regarded as useful.

Although reflexes of PWOc _&ast;lapuka_ mean 'breadfruit' in some languages, the fact that there were at least two other POc terms for breadfruit ([ch.9, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-9)) suggests that the reflexes glossed '_Parartocarpus venenosa_' retain the POc denotation. Kwara'ae _rakʷa-na_ is irregular, with initial _r-_ for expected †_l-_ and suffixed _-na_ (medial _-kʷ-_ is a regular reflex of _&ast;-pʷ-_). Araki levu is irregular with _-e-_ for †_-a-_.

## Notes

[^1]: Two other nut-bearing species are cultivated in NW Melanesia: _Canarium lamii_ along the north coast of New Guinea and the species with the largest trees and largest nuts, _Canarium decumanum_, in the Admiralties ([Yen 1996](Source#cldf:Yen1996)). Their ranges are too narrow for them to be relevant here.

[^2]: Wild specimens with inedible nuts occur westward from Santa Cruz ([Yen 1985](Source#cldf:Yen1985): 320, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 104).

[^3]: For example among Takia and Kwara'ae speakers and on Small Malaita the pudding is made with taro (_Colocasia esculenta_), on Ulawa with yams (_Dioscorea esculenta_) (personal observation, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 102, [Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927): 367-369).

[^4]: According to [Record](Source#cldf:Record1945) ([1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)) _Canarium salomonense_ is shorter than _Canarium indicum_, around 15 m. tall, but [Evans'](Source#cldf:Evans1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 40) survey of Solomons _Canarium_ species found that the two had similar average heights, around 20m, both 7 m taller than _Canarium harveyi_.

[^5]: PCEMP &ast;ka(n,ŋ)aRi is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic data here and of Bima _kanari_, Far East Manggarai (Toring) _kenari_, Solorese _kenari_ (all CMP) ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 197).

[^6]: The Drehet final consonant points to loss of a following vowel. In Mangap a final vowel is regularly assimilated to the penultimate vowel. In Numbami _-a_ is added after the reflex of a POc final consonant, and so final _-a_ is not diagnostic of a POc final vowel.

[^7]: Reasons for the confusion are (i) that Rotuman _ʔifi_ '_Inocarpus fagifer_' has an unexpected initial _ʔ-_ (this is probably an outcome of borrowing), and (ii) that Samoan - as a result of regular sound changes - reflects both as _ifi_, and disambiguates them by adding an extra morpheme when the term denotes the ironwood: _ifi-lele_ 'a large timber tree, Intsia sp.' and _ifi-fatu_ 'a hard-grained _ifi-lele_' as opposed to _ifi_ 'Inocarpus sp.'. Bwaidoga _ɣ-_ reflects an unpredictable accretion.

[^8]: In view of the discussion in this section, a figure showing _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ would be preferable, but none could be found.

[^9]: Its spread to locations elsewhere in Papua New Guinea is a post-contact phenomenon (R.M. Bourke, pers. comm.).

[^10]: In Kara, Patpatar and Tolai of New Ireland the name of _Barringtonia procera_ is a compound (e.g. _paua-hutun_ in Patpatar) of the names of _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_ (_paua_) and _Barringtonia asiatica_ (_hutun_) ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 397). [Jebb](Source#cldf:Jebb1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Jebb1992)) suggests that this is evidence for a recent introduction of _Barringtonia procera_ into the Bismarck Archipelago (he cites Bourke's research). This is only weak circumstantial evidence, however, as a glance through Peekel shows that such compound plant names are common, and [Evans](Source#cldf:Evans1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999)) reports that such a compound is used in S Malaitan to denote _Barringtonia edulis_ because the nut is eaten but fish poison is extracted from the bark.

[^11]: Predictably, _kubar_ means 'red'. However, _pala_ means 'coconut husk', perhaps alluding to the green pericarp of an unhusked young coconut. However, this term does not reflect either of the POc terms reconstructed for 'coconut husk' ([ch.12, §4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:3-12).)

[^12]: In Hiri Motu, the lingua franca of parts of southern Papua New Guinea, the term _okari_ denotes _Terminalia kaernbachii_; in Tok Pisin it denotes _Terminalia impediens_, cultivated on the coasts of the Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun Provinces of mainland Papua New Guinea; ([Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)) .

[^13]: The gloss of the Mwotlap and Mota terms, _Albizia saman_, can be ignored for reconstructive purposes, as the latter is an introduced tree ([ch.7, §3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-7)), and was certainly not a POc denotatum of _&ast;tapoRa_.

[^14]: This term was recorded only in the inland dialect in which coastal Takia _l_ and _r_ are merged as _l_, i.e. _tapal_ is a regular reflex of _&ast;tapoRa_.

[^15]: E Fijian _l_ usually reflects POc/PEOc _&ast;l_, but [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990)) shows that it sometimes reflects _&ast;R_. [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 80), however, thinks it is a borrowing from an unidentified Solomons source.

[^16]: There are a number of other _Pandanus_ species in New Guinea and the Bismarcks ([Kennedy & Clarke 2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)), including _P. julianettii_, _P. antarensis_ and _P. brosimos_, all with fruit known as _karuka_ in Tok Pisin and a major nutritional source in highlands areas, but they do not grow in the lowlands and do not concern us here .

[^17]: Its use elsewhere in the Solomons is unclear because [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) provide no species identifications for the pandanus types they describe .

[^18]: The reconstruction of PMP _&ast;kiRay_ is supported by the Oceanic data and by Manobo, Tboli (both Philippines) _kilay_ '_Pandanus_ sp.' ([Madulid 2001a](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a): 373).

[^19]: [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988)) do not identify the species of the right-hand drawing in [Figure 11.5](#fig-3-11_5), but comparison with [Barrau's](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 160) picture of _Pandanus tectorius_ confirms its identification.

[^20]: It is possible that Far East Manggarai _wako_, Ngadlha _waku_ 'broad-leafed _Pandanus_ sp.' and their cognates listed by [Verheijen](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 232) are cognate with POc _&ast;pakum_. If so, it is a PCEMP etymon.

[^21]: [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1996b) ([1996b](Source#cldf:Blust1996b)) cites the Admiralties forms as representing a PAdm lexical innovation, but the Mapos Buang and Arosi forms in this set show that the form is reconstructable to POc. In [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1996d) ([1996d](Source#cldf:Ross1996d)) I reconstructed this form as _&ast;mʷaŋa_ on the basis of the forms listed under 'cf. also' below: this was perhaps an error, but see the discussion in the text.

[^22]: Kosirava (coastal) dialect.

[^23]: The spelling _nə-vha-vha_ represents an attempt to interpret [Wheatley's](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992)) _nawhawha_ and is not necessarily accurate.

[^24]: [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1962) ([1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 179) suggests that one edible citrus species, _Citrus_ macroptera, is indigenous to Melanesia, but there is no clear evidence of this. [May](Source#cldf:May1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:May1984): 79) applies the term _Citrus_ papuana to the green-skinned bush orange, but this name properly applies as a synonym to the almost inedible _Citrus_ hystrix, whilst the green-skinned bush orange is _Citrus_ sinensis, which, as its name implies, is an import to Melanesia ([French 1986](Source#cldf:French1986):226,231).

[^25]: It is not mentioned by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)).

[^26]: Note that Garuga ([ch.7, §4.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-8#cldf:3-7)) is said to resemble _Spondias cytherea_. See PNCV _&ast;mal-mali_ below.

[^27]: Despite its name, _Ximenia americana_ has an African origin.

[^28]: _S. gomata_ is not listed in IPNI or APNI. The species label gomata appears to reflect Tolai _gamata_ '_Syzygium_ malaccense', and _S. gomata_ is perhaps a variety thereof.

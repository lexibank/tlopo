## 1. Introduction


Tropical coastal habitats are of two kinds, depending on whether or not fresh as well as salt water is available along the coastal strip. If fresh water is available, then a mangrove swamp may occur (chapter 6). If there is no fresh water or if mangroves are removed by human agency, a beach is formed.[^1] In NW Island Melanesia beaches are usually sandy (rather than pebbly) and range from almost white, from the erosion of coral reefs and shells, to almost black, from the erosion of volcanic rocks. A beach creates an environment for coastal strand vegetation, which typically consists of three zones, the first two usually forming quite narrow bands:[^2]

- herbaceous zone ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-5));
- beach scrub ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-5));
- littoral forest ([§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:3-5)).

There is sometimes also an underwater zone in the coastal shallows which is home to seagrasses and seaweeds.

Where the coast is gradually being built out by the accretion of sand, a succession of ridges develops, parallel to the beach. Ridges closer to the beach are typically about two metres high ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 27-28). The __herbaceous zone__ begins at the high-tide mark and occupies the beach up to the first ridge. It has a cover of creeping plants which include _Ipomoea pes-caprae_ ([§3 .1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-5)), _Canavalia rosea_ (syn. _Canavalia maritima_) (no reconstruction) and _Wedelia biflora_ ([§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-5)), as well as grasses and sedges which include _Thuarea involuta_ ([ch.8, §3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-8)).

On their landward side the beach ridges merge into gently undulating flats which provide the environment for __beach scrub__. The border between the herbaceous zone and beach scrub is often vague and the two zones overlap. Beach scrub consists of shrubs like _Pemphis acidula_ ([§4.1.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-4#cldf:3-5)) and _Scaevola taccada_ ([§4.1.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-5#cldf:3-5)) and low-growing bushy-crowned trees like _Cordia subcordata_ ([§4.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-1#cldf:3-5)), _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_ ([§4.1.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-2#cldf:3-5)), _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ ([§4.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-3#cldf:3-5)), _Thespesia populnea_ ([§4.1.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-6#cldf:3-5)), _Tournefortia argentea_ ([§4.1.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-7#cldf:3-5)) and _Vitex trifolia_ ([§4.1.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-8#cldf:3-5)), often densely tangled with climbers like _Flagellaria indica_ ([§4.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-1#cldf:3-5)). Beneath the shrubs is a ground layer of ferns, grasses, gingers and herbs which includes _Crinum asiaticum_ ([ch. 13, §6.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6#cldf:3-13)) ([Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 50).


<a id="p-130"></a>

Landwards, there is a transition, abrupt or gradual, from beach scrub to __littoral forest__ (although it is common in NW Island Melanesia for littoral forest to have been displaced by coconut groves). This forest is often dominated by evergreen broadleaf trees like _Barringtonia asiatica_ ([§5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-5)), _Calophyllum inophyllum_ ([§5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3#cldf:3-5)), _Heritiera littoralis_ ([ch.6, §4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:3-6)) and _Terminalia catappa_ ([ch.11, §2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:3-11)) (and in the Solomons _Cerbera manghas_, [ch.6, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:3-6)) or the screwpine _Pandanus tectorius_ (or on coral soil _Pandanus dubius_) ([ch.11, §2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:3-11)) or sometimes _Casuarina equisetifolia_ ([§5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-4#cldf:3-5)). Where beach ridges have been eroded, littoral forest borders immediately on the beach, and _Barringtonia asiatica_ ([§5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2#cldf:3-5)) predominates. Trees of lesser stature reported by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)) in the littoral forest in New Ireland include _Adenanthera pavonina_ ([§5.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-1#cldf:3-5)), _Guettarda speciosa_ ([§5.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-8#cldf:3-5)) and _Pongamia pinnata_ ([§5.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-12#cldf:3-5)). In the Solomons the lower storey includes _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ ([§4.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-3#cldf:3-5)), _Diospyros_ species ([ch.7, §5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-5#cldf:3-7)), _Kleinhovia hospita_ ([ch. 7, §5. 7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-7#cldf:3-7)), _Ficus austrina_ (no reconstruction), _Premna corymbosa_ [§5.13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-13#cldf:3-5)) and _Morinda citrifolia_ ([ch.13, §3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:3-13)) ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976):29-20, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):321, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 50, 59, 70).

As the chapter numbers in the crossreferences above indicate, it is difficult to draw a line between littoral forest and lowland rain forest, as the two shade into each other. Trees which grow in lowland rain forest generally are mostly assigned to chapter 7. Certain trees of damper littoral forest also thrive on the landward margins of mangrove forests (_Heritiera littoralis_, _Cerbera manghas_) and are treated in chapter 6. _Terminalia catappa_, _Pandanus tectorius_ and _Morinda citrifolia_ fall under the rubric of tended or cultivated plants and are discussed in chapter 11.

From the perspective of linguistic reconstruction the shrubs and trees of the beach scrub zone and the littoral forest stand out because their names are quite easy to reconstruct, their Proto Oceanic (POc) names are often continuations of earlier forms, and they display continuity within Oceania. There are probably three main reasons for this. The first is simply that these plants have a very wide Pacific distrilbution, an obvious condition of continuity in naming. The second is probably that, being just behind the beach, they were easily accessible from people's homes in beachside villages, and, thirdly, they also happen to be useful plants.

## 2. Coastal shallows


The coastal shallows are home to seagrasses and seaweeds and, if there is a reef, to any number of marine plants. Seagrasses are those families of Angiosperms (flowering plants) that spend their entire life cycle under water. Seaweeds, on the other hand, are algae.

POc had a generic term for mosses, algaes and seaweeds, namely _&ast;lumut_ or _&ast;limut_ ([§4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6#cldf:3-5)). Beyond this, comparative lexical material on these plants is thin, and only two further reconstructions are offered here. Glosses in the sources are vague, often not distinguishing between seagrass and seaweed. There are no species identifications.

The Tawala description below, 'seaweed like kunai grass in appearance', is a reasonable characterisation of seagrasses of the genus _Enhalus_, which is characterised by long narrow leaves ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 42-44, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 13) and this is the (weak) basis for the gloss of PNGOc _&ast;domu_.


<a id="p-131"></a>

[PNGOc &ast;_domu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-2-None-131-PNGOc-domu-a)

The glosses of the items supporting the reconstruction of POc _&ast;karagʷam_ are both too vague and too varied to allow the denotation to be further pinned down. The Drehet gloss suggests a seaweed, Andra a seagrass. The Motu gloss is somewhat confusing, as _Fucus_ is a genus of algae, not seagrass.

## 3. The herbaceous zone



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. _Ipomoea_ spp., morning glory (Convolvulaceae)


Within the Evans' _&ast;waRoc_ 'vines and creepers' taxon ([ch.3, §4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:3-3)) there was apparently a subtaxon _&ast;puRe_, which consisted of beach creepers. [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) takes the PEOc reflex to have denoted shore creepers of the genus _Convolvulus_. The evidence for this in the cognate set below is at first sight thin. However, there is a strong tendency in the botanical literature for _Ipomoea_ species ('morning glory') to have synonyms in the genus _Convolvulus_, and it is likely that some, if not all, of the _Convolvulus_ glosses below denote _Ipomoea_ species. It is thus possible that POc _&ast;puRe_ prototypically denoted _Ipomoea grandiflora_ (syn. _Ipomoea tuba_, _Convolvulus tuba_, _Calonyction grandiflorum_) and _Ipomoea pes-caprae_ ([Figure 5.1](#fig-3-5_1), left), beach creepers with trumpet-like flowers, white and purple respectively, commonly found on beaches in the Bismarck Archipelago ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 461). Eastern Polynesian reflexes reflect a shift in denotatum to the gourd _Lagenaria siceraria_ ([ch.13, §7.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1#cldf:3-13)).


<a id="p-132"></a>

No reconstruction can be made for another beach creeper, _Canavalia rosea_ (syn. _Canavalia maritima_), which typically co-occurs with _Ipomoea pes-caprae_. It is possible that it was included, at least at some locations, in the _&ast;puRe_ subtaxon.

<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. _Wedelia biflora_ (syn. _Wollastonia biflora_) (Asteraceae)


_Wedelia biflora_ ([Figure 5.1](#fig-3-5_1), right) is a herbaceous or half-shrubby coastal plant, usually 1.5-2.5 m tall, with yellow flowers. On the beach it sometimes forms impenetrable thickets, but it also occurs in the littoral forest, where it climbs as high as 6m ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 561).

The leaves are filled with a tasty milk-like sap, and Tangga speakers (offshore east of southern New Ireland) boil and eat them ([Bell 1947](Source#cldf:Bell1947): 244)). At Marovo the leaves are an ingredient in cures for stomach ache ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 108).

The following comparison is due to Blust (ACD), who associates it with PMP _&ast;qatay_ 'liver', since sources from the Philippines and northern Sulawesi suggest that the plant owes its name to the fact that its leaves are shaped like a pig's liver.

[Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003)) reconstruct PChk _&ast;adɨ-adɨ_ '_Wedelia biflora_'. It is hard to believe that this is not associated with the reconstruction above, but this association must be by borrowing (perhaps from Yapese), as the PChk form would reflect POc †_&ast;(q)a(s,j)u-(q)a(s,j)u_, not _&ast;qate-qate_.

## 4. Beach scrub



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Woody shrubs and small trees



<a id="s-4-1-1"></a>

#### 4.1.1. _Cordia subcordata_, kerosene wood, island walnut, sea trumpet, Pacific rosewood, P _kerasin wud_, B _burao blong solwata_ (Boraginaceae)


A twisted shore tree 8-15 m tall, _Cordia subcordata_ ([Figure 5.2](#fig-3-5_2), left) is well known for its very strong black-veined heartwood, which may remain as a skeleton after the rest of a dead tree has rotted away (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.). It occurs in varieties with orange and yellow flowers ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 471, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131).

Its wood is lightweight but durable. In the western Solomons, in Vanuatu and on Waya Island it is used for carving ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 56, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006), [Friday & Okano 2006](Source#cldf:FridayandOkano2006)). In earlier times the Marovo also used it for house posts, but its use in construction seems never to have been widespread. On New Ireland, however, the ceremonial V-shaped entrance to a men's house was always made of _Cordia subcordata_ ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)). In Tonga it was used for carving and for construction ([Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 108). [Gowers](Source#cldf:Gowers1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 56) and [Capell](Source#cldf:Capell1941) ([1941](Source#cldf:Capell1941)) report that its sap served as an adhesive in Vanuatu and Fiji.

POc _&ast;kanawa(n)_, _&ast;toRu_ and _&ast;jasi_ and PWOc _&ast;nagi_ are all reconstructable, but contrasts in meaning are unclear.

The term _&ast;jasi_ is reconstructed for PCEMP and POc (rather than PEOc, as the data here imply) because there appears to be an external cognate in Timorese _(nonwai) tasi_ '_Cordia_s ubcordata' ([Heyne 1950](Source#cldf:Heyne1950): 1306).

#### 4.1.2. _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_ (syn. _Hernandia peltata_), sea hearse tree, lantern tree, B _nambirimbiri_, _napiripiri_, _bluwud_ (Hernandiaceae)


<a id="fig-3-5_3"> </a>

[__Figure 5.3:__ _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_, sea hearse tree](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_3)



[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 192) describes _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_ as 'one of the most frequent beach trees' in New Ireland. It is a small tree with hard white wood, white flowers and spherical white fruit about 3cm in diameter which ripen to pink ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 85).

The Nakanai of New Britain and people in parts of Vanuatu use the trunk for making canoe hulls. The Nakanai also use the wood for hourglass drums ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 85).

[Bennett](Source#cldf:Bennettnd) ([n.d.](Source#cldf:Bennettnd)) comments that at Biliau (north coast of New Guinea) the flowers are used on a hook to attract fish when one is fishing from a moving boat.

On Waya Island (Fiji) the flowers are said to have provided medicine for asthma ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)), and Gowers also reports that it was held to have medicinal properties in Vanuatu.


<a id="p-137"></a>

There is some evidence that for early Oceanic speakers _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_ and _Thespesia populnea_ ([§4.1.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-6#cldf:3-5)) formed a taxon.[^7] Both are small shore trees and both have hard wood that is used for hourglass drums. In Lau the regular reflex of POc _&ast;biRi-biRi_ '_Hernandia nymphaeifolia_' denotes '_Thespesia populnea_'. In Wayan Fijian the same is true of a borrowed reflex of _&ast;biRi-biRi_. The Kiribati reflex of _&ast;biRi-biRi_ appears to denote both tree species.

The Nduke and Roviana reflexes appear to denote _Excoecaria agallocha_ ([ch.6, §4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3#cldf:3-6)), the leaves of which resemble those of _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_ (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.).

[Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)) takes the _&ast;-r-_ of PNCV _&ast;biri-biri_ below to reflect POc _&ast;-r-_, but loss of the rhotic in PPn _&ast;pipi_ points to POc _&ast;-R-_. Recent work by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2007) ([2007](Source#cldf:Lynch2007)) shows that PNCV _&ast;-r-_ may reflect either POc _&ast;-r-_ or POc _&ast;-R-_, confirming that the POc form was almost certainly _&ast;biRi-biRi_. There is a margin of uncertainty because the Polynesian forms have short _i_ where long vowels are expected, and the authors of POLLEX suggest that this may reflect borrowing.

The Seimat and Micronesian forms reflect POc †_&ast;biŋi-biŋi_ rather than _&ast;biRi-biRi_. It is possible that the Seimat form represents a borrowing from a Micronesian language, but PMic _&ast;-ŋ-_ remains unexplained.

#### 4.1.3. _Hibiscus tiliaceus_, beach hibiscus, TP _mangas_, P, B _burao_ (Malvaceae)


_Hibiscus tiliaceus_ is a small sprawling, tangled shore tree with small girth, a branching trunk and pale yellow flowers ([Figure 5.2](#fig-3-5_2), right). It grows 5-15 m tall ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 364, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 161). [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrauetal1965) ([1965](Source#cldf:Barrauetal1965)) reports that the bark was eaten in New Caledonia, and almost every source agrees that it provides fibre to make cordage, mats and nets (e.g. [Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989), [Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 29).

The POc term for _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ was _&ast;paRu_. Blust (ACD) suggests that it is reflected in terms for 'tie' like Bauan _vau_ 'tie, bind' and Samoan _fau_ 'bind, lash together', but it is now clear that these terms reflect POc _&ast;paqu(s)_, _&ast;paqus-i-_ 'bind, lash; construct canoe by tying together' ([vol.1, ch.9, §10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-10#cldf:1-9)).

<a id="p-139"></a>


<a id="p-140"></a>

The cognate set below contains a number of puzzles. It has just one Western Oceanic member, Kokota _faɣalo_, but this is likely to be a borrowing from a SE Solomonic language, and so the protoform is reconstructed for PEOc, not for POc. As [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)) points out, a number of the forms from Malakula display metathesis, reflecting _&ast;bʷalaka_ rather than _&ast;bʷakala_, whilst Anejom displays loss of medial _&ast;-k-_. These appear to be local innovations. More problematic are the discrepancies between the SE Solomonic forms and all other reflexes, as they make a reliable PEOc reconstruction impossible. PSES _&ast;vaɣalo_ '_Hibiscus tiliaceus_' looks very like an irregular (borrowed?) reflex of POc _&ast;paRu_ above, which was also regularly reflected as PSES _&ast;vatu_, as the SES forms above show. The PNCV form _&ast;bʷakala_ displays the rounding feature not on its final syllable (cf PSES _&ast;-o_) but on its first syllable. This is decidedly unusual, but, as the alternative Kwara'ae dialectal form _faʔola_ shows, rounding shift does occur.

#### 4.1.4. _Pemphis acidula_ (Lythraceae)



<a id="p-141"></a>

_Pemphis acidula_ is a small twisted beach tree ([Figure 5.4](#fig-3-5_4), left) with very hard, tough wood used at Marovo to make tools such as pestles, husking sticks and weapons ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131), in Tonga for tool handles and house parts ([Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 39) and in Tahiti to make combs (POLLEX). Its distribution seems to be patchy: it is not mentioned by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984)) for the Bismarcks nor by [Borrell](Source#cldf:Borrell1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Borrell1989)) for Kairim (Schoutens). Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) suggests that its distribution across Oceania was once quite uniform but that it was so useful that it was pushed to extinction in some places. The reconstruction of POc _&ast;ŋiRac_ is unproblematic as its reflexes are regular.

#### 4.1.5. _Scaevola taccada_ (syn. _Scaevola koenigii_, _Scaevola sericea_, _Scaevola frutescens_), B _haf flaoa_ (Goodeniaceae)


[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 553) describes _Scaevola taccada_ as a 'stiffly erect shrub with finger-thick fleshy green twigs, 2-4m tall' and 'common, on sandy beaches' ([Figure 5.4](#fig-3-5_4), middle). The shrubs grow in dense clusters near the beach ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 122). It is probably the best distributed plant on the Pacific islands, found on the smallest islets and the largest islands (W. Mc-Clatchey, pers. comm.). The light green leaves are somewhat succulent with a waxy covering and are alternately arranged along the stem. The white or cream flowers, often with purple streaks, are 8-12 mm long and have a pleasant smell. All five petals are on one side of the flower, so that they look as if they have been torn in half (hence the Bislama term _haf flaoa_). The fruit of _Scaevola taccada_ are fleshy white oblong berries of varying size, the smallest about 1 cm long.

On Lihir the leaves are squeezed in salt water and the resultant sap is used for various medicinal purposes. The leaves are heated over the fire and rubbed on the skin to relieve pain in joints, bones, and muscles (S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001)). The stem bark was used for medicinal purposes in Tonga ([Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 38). At Marovo the leaves are used during fishing trips to shield the catch from the sun and to parcel up food. Newly broken leaves and branches provide evidence that a turtle has made a nest nearby ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 122).

PEMP _&ast;nasu-nasu_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic data here, plus Weda (S Halmahera) _nesnas_ and Biak _anas_, both '_Scaevola taccada_' ([Heyne 1950](Source#cldf:Heyne1950): 1428). It happens that _&ast;-u_ is lost from POc &ast;CVC_u_ forms in Pak and in the Western Oceanic and Southern Vanuatu languages in which reflexes occur. Thus although only reflected in Micronesian and Polynesian languages, medial and final _&ast;u_ are reconstructed both for PEMP and POc because the canonic form (CVCV[C]) of morphemes in these protolanguages requires the reconstruction of a final vowel in the morpheme that then undergoes reduplication.

#### 4.1.6. _Thespesia populnea_ (syn. _Thespesia macrophylla_), B _burao blong solwota_ (Malvaceae)


_Thespesia populnea_ is a tree typically 5-10 m and sometimes as much as 15m in height with large yellow flowers which have a brown centre ([Figure 5.4](#fig-3-5_4), right). Its strong dark-brown heartwood is used to make hourglass drums in New Ireland. The bark is used as binding material ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 369). In Tonga it is used in handicrafts, house parts and canoes, and extract from the scraped bark is given to babies to treat mouth infections ([Whistler 1991b](Source#cldf:Whistler1991b): 86).

#### 4.1.7. Tournifortia argentea (syn. _Messerschmidia argentea_), tree heliotrope, beach heliotrope (Boraginaceae)


_Tournefortia argentea_ is a small heliotropic beach tree 5-8 m tall with silvery hairy leaves and white flowers. It has a short bole covered in deeply corrugated bark. Limited to beachside environments, it is tolerant of salt water ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):471-472, [Manner & Elevitch2006b](Source#cldf:MannerandElevitch2006b)). At Marovo, where it is reported often to grow in association with _Cordia subcordata_ ([§4.1.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-1#cldf:3-5) ), children use the sticky sap to catch butterflies ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 111).

No term for '_Tournefortia argentea_' is reconstructed at a higher-order level than PPn _&ast;tau-sinu_ or PMic _&ast;cen_. There is no obvious reason for this, as it is a common tree in the Bismarcks. However, the data offer tiny hints that in POc _Tournefortia argentea_ formed a taxon with _Scaevola taccada_ ([§4.1.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-5#cldf:3-5)), i.e. POc _&ast;na[su]-nasu_ '_Scaevola taccada_' also denoted _Tournefortia argentea_, perhaps with a modifier added to distinguish between the two species. Thus the Patpatar (New Ireland) term for _Tournefortia argentea_ is _i-nas-nas_, reflecting POc _&ast;nasu-nasu_, whilst the term for _Scaevola taccada_ is _i-nas-nas-madil-madil_. Conversely E Uvean _tauhunu_ '_Scaevola taccada_' reflects PPn _&ast;tau-suni_ '_Tournefortia argentea_'. Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) tells me that a taxon consisting of _Tournefortia argentea_ and _Scaevola taccada_ makes sense for two reasons: 'First, the plants live in the same environment and have the same suite of adaptations for survival. Second, in my experience working with healers and fisherpersons, they use the two for very similar purposes.'

<a id="p-145"></a>

Reconstructing the PPn form from the cognate set below is tricky. There are two competing PNPn reconstructions, _&ast;tausinu_ and _&ast;tausunu_: the latter almost certainly reflects the former with vowel assimilation. The Tongan, Niuean and Samoan forms reflect _&ast;tausuni_, but for two reasons I prefer to reconstruct PPn _&ast;tausinu_. First, it is favoured by the distribution of the data, as it is reflected in Nuclear Polynesian Pukapukan and in several Eastern Polynesian languages, whereas _&ast;tausuni_ reflects metathesis, then probable diffusion in the Tonga-Samoa area (A. Pawley, pers. comm.). Second, it is likely that the term was originally bimorphemic, and the second morpheme perhaps reflects PCP _&ast;sinu_ 'a shrub or tree, possibly _Phaleria_ sp.' ([§6.1.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-1-5#cldf:3-5)). Both _Tournefortia argentea_ and _Phaleria coccinea_ have white flowers.

[PPn &ast;_tausinu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-4-1-145-PPn-tausinu-a)

The PMic form _&ast;cen_ '_Tournefortia argentea_' looks at first sight as if it also reflects PROc _&ast;sinu_. If it does, however, this is a result of borrowing, as PMic _&ast;c-_ reflects POc _&ast;d_ or _&ast;dr-_, not POc _&ast;s-_.

#### 4.1.8. _Vitex trifolia_ (syn. _Vitex negundo_) (Verbenaceae)



<a id="p-146"></a>

_Vitex trifolia_ is an erect shrub or small tree: 1-5 m tall which grows on the beach and on muddy stream banks. In the older botanical literature it is sometimes confused with _Vitex rotundifolia_, a low-lying shrub less that a metre in height, growing inland on poor sandy soils (W. McClatchey, pers. comm.), and the two evidently form a taxon in Wayan Fijian: _drala ni mataðawa_ 'beach drala' but _drala kaka_ 'wild drala'.

<a id="fig-3-5_6"> </a>

[__Figure 5.6:__ _Vitex trifolia_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_6)



_Vitex trifolia_ has sprays of blue-purple flowers and fruit. All parts of the plant are aromatic. On New Ireland the crushed leaves are used against headache. On Waya juice from the leaves is used as a healing agent for wounds ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):481, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

The POc term for _Vitex trifolia_ was _&ast;drala_. Both POc _&ast;drala_ '_Vitex trifolia_' and POc _&ast;rarap_ 'Indian coral tree, _Erythrina variegata_' ([§5.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-5#cldf:3-5)) are regularly reflected as Bauan Fijian _drala_.[^12] The two terms are disambiguated by the addition of _sala_ 'path, road, track' to form the binomial _drala sala_ '_Vitex trifolia_'.

In PPn the two forms would similarly have fallen together as _&ast;lala_, but here the form survived with the meaning '_Vitex trifolia_', whilst PPn †_&ast;lala_ '_Erythrina variegata_' was lost.[^13]

### 4.2. Climbers



<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. _Flagellaria indica_, supplejack, B _navula_ (Flagellariaceae)


_Flagellaria indica_ is a climbing cane-like vine whose stem, 1-1.5cm thick, grows to a length of 3-6 m. The leaves are 20-40cm long and have a curling tendril at the apex with which the plant secures itself to its host.

The long strong woody stem remains pliable and serves the functions of a rope. The stems are prepared for use as cordage by splitting them and drying them in the sun. They serve as a binding and plaiting material, especially to sew sago matting ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 76). They are also used as anchor cables and as rope: for bindings in canoe- and house construction and in roofing ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001), [Thieberger 2006b](Source#cldf:Thieberger2006b)). In various parts of the Solomons lengths of whole _Flagellaria indica_ complete with their long leaves are joined together to make scarelines (Marovo _arara_, a reduplicated form of _ara_ '_Flagellaria indica_' ). These are laid out to encircle fish on reef flats or in the lagoon and scare them into traps or into an area of shallow water with a limited exit ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):216, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 101). On Lihir a potion made from _Flagellaria indica_ is said to impart the ability to fight well (S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001)).

[__Figure 5.7:__ _Flagellaria indica_: __A__, climbing plant; __B__, leaf with tendrils; __C__; shoot with fruit; __D__, flowers.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_7)



POc _&ast;waR[e]_ '_Flagellaria indica_' reflects PMP _&ast;huaR_ '_Flagellaria indica_' (ACD). The expected POc descendant of this form is _&ast;waR_, and this is reflected by Nduke _[a]r-ara_ (reduplicated) and Kokota _n-ara_.[^14] POc was seemingly resistant to monosyllabic content words, and Mussau, Seimat and Kwara'ae reflect a form with a final vowel, which shows up as _&ast;-e_ in Mussau and Kwara'ae.

The Muyuw, Sursurunga, Tangga and Mwotlap forms all reflect POc &ast;-l-. Muyuw _weled_ also has a final _-d_, and may be a chance resemblance rather than a cognate. The other forms shown under 'cf. also', however, are either outcomes of borrowing or reflect a POc alternant _&ast;wale_.

#### 4.2.2. _Hoya_ spp. (Asclepiadaceae)


Leafy climbers of _Hoya_ species are often found on the beach and around mangroves and beach trees ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 455-457).

The reconstructions of PCEMP _&ast;(d,r)a(d,r)ap_ and POc _&ast;dradrap_ below are based on just two etyma, Muyuw _dadav_ and Ngadha (CMP) _rara_ '_Hoya_ spp.' ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 220).

### 5.1. _Adenanthera pavonina_ (syn. _Adenanthera gersenii_, _Adenanthera polita_, _Corallaria parvifolia_), bead tree, red sandalwood, B _bisa_, _nabisa_ (Mimosaceae)


A tree which grows to 8-15 m on sandy foreshores and coral soil, _Adenanthera pavonina_ is well known for its shiny scarlet, disk-shaped seeds about 6 mm in diameter which serve widely as necklace beads. It has a small, yellowish flower which grows in dense drooping rat's-tail flower heads resembling catkins. Its flowers are white to yellowish, and the seeds grow in curved hanging pods, with a bulge opposite each seed, which curl up and turn brown ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 210).


<a id="p-149"></a>

The wood is medium hard and in Vanuatu is used for houseposts ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 19). [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 75) reports that the leaves are eaten in some Papua New Guinea locations, but Peekel makes no mention of this.

The distribution of _Adenanthera pavonina_ is odd: it is reported from Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, but not mentioned by Solomons sources. It is also missing from [Borrell's](Source#cldf:Borrell1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Borrell1989)) flora checklist for Kairiru. It is native to SE Asia, but Rhys Gardner and Will McClatchey (both pers. comm.) suggest that it is a (recently?) introduced plant, at least from Fiji eastwards and perhaps also in Vanuatu. If this is so, then the two data sets require an explanation other than cognacy. The first set appears to support PROc _&ast;(m,mʷ)ata_, but the items glossed '_Adenanthera pavonina_' are all from languages located in Vanuatu (Emae and Ifira-Mele are Polynesian outliers in Vanuatu) and probably reflect a series of borrowings. Items denoting other species are presumably chance resemblances.

### 5.2. _Barringtonia asiatica_ (syn. _Barringtonia speciosa_, _Barringtonia littorea_), sea poison tree, fish poison tree, P _poesentri_, B _fisposentri_ (Lecythidaceae)



<a id="p-150"></a>

For naming purposes, _Barringtonia_ species in NW Island Melanesia fall into two groups:

- those with edible nuts: _Barringtonia novae-hiberniae_, _Barringtonia procera_ and _Barringtonia edulis_ ([ch.11, §2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3#cldf:3-11)); and
- those with inedible nuts, of which just one species, _Barringtonia asiatica_, has a reconstructable name and is the subject of this section.

Two other species with inedible nuts, _Barringtonia racemosa_ and _Barringtonia niedenzuana_, resemble _Barringtonia edulis_ in appearance.[^16] The Patpatar and Tolai names for _Barringtonia racemosa_ are respectively _paua-paua_ and _pao-pao_, reduplicated forms of Patpatar _paua_ and Tolai _pao_ '_Barringtonia edulis_' ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 397-399), the reduplication expressing the inferiority of _Barringtonia racemosa_ ([ch.2, §7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2#cldf:3-2)).

_Barringtonia asiatica_ is a large beach tree, 10--20 m high, which is able to grow with its roots in salt water at times. It has large white and pink flowers which open at night and close in the morning, and ten-centimetre square fruits that float in the sea and sprout when they reach the shore. Fishermen use them as buoys or fishing floats. The seeds contain a poison. In New Ireland they are grated and thrown into the water to stun fish in pools on the reef. At Marovo they are sometimes used to kill dogs, but they also serve as medication for ringworm, scabies and other skin diseases ([French-Wright 1983](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983): 157, [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 397, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 139)

Two terms are reconstructable, POc _&ast;putun_, which is reflected all over Oceania except in parts of Vanuatu, where it is replaced by PNCV _&ast;vuabu_,[^17] and in the Chuukic languages of Micronesia, where it is replaced by a reflex of POc _&ast;kuluR_ 'breadfruit, _Artocarpus altilis_' ([Ch.9, §4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-9)).

### 5.3. _Calophyllum inophyllum_, portia, Indian laurel, Alexandrian laurel, beach mahogany, TP _kalopilum_, B _tamanu_, _nabakura_ (Clusiaceae)


Often with a short gnarled trunk or branches leaning out over the sea, _Calophyllum inophyllum_ is a salient shore tree about 10--20 metres tall with fragrant flowers and small round fruit ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 106).

Its red wood is very hard and difficult to work when it is seasoned. The grain is interlocked, and so the wood does not split easily ([Margetts 2005b](Source#cldf:Margetts2005b)). Its straight smaller branches are used for pig spears, for outrigger booms and for building ([Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950), [Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 377, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). In Vanuatu the sap serves for patching holes in wood. In other parts of the Pacific the gum, bark, leaves, roots, flowers and oil from the seeds are used in traditional medicine ([Gowers 1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976):40, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)). Its macerated leaves are used to stupefy octopus in holes in the reef and its burnt fruit provide black hair dye. In the Ninigos, where Seimat is spoken, a brown dye is made from the yellowish milky sap ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945), [Sorensen 1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950)).

Other species of _Calophyllum_ grow inland, hence straight, and provide even better timber than _Calophyllum inophyllum_, including canoe hulls. _Calophyllum kajewskii_ (syn. _Calophyllum peekelii_) is a rain forest tree than grows up to 50 m.

There are a number of reconstructions with _Calophyllum_ species as denotata. The most widely reflected is POc _&ast;pitaquR_, inherited from PMP, and it is reasonably clear that it denoted '_Calophyllum inophyllum_'. The only evidence we have for the POc retention of PMP _&ast;-R_ is found in the reflexes in New Georgia languages: Nduke _vizolo_, Roviana _vi-vizolo_ and Marovo _vi-vijolo_. However, the expected form in these languages is †_vita(ɣ)uru_, and the actual forms must be outcomes of borrowing. The languages of the western Solomons have complex and ill understood borrowing histories ([Ross 2010b](Source#cldf:Ross2010b)).

<a id="fig-3-5_9"> </a>

[__Figure 5.9:__ _Calophyllum inophyllum_: __A__, mature tree; __B__, flowering shoot; __C__, fruit cluster.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_9)




<a id="p-153"></a>

Other reconstructions glossed '_Calophyllum inophyllum_' are PMM _&ast;bu(y)ap_ (possibly of POc antiquity) and POc _&ast;dalo_ (probably inherited from PCEMP). It seems unlikely that POc had more than one term for _Calophyllum inophyllum_ and thus it is possible that _&ast;dalo_ denoted some other species. POc _&ast;tamanu_ and PNGOc _&ast;sabʷa(r,R)i_ denote unidentified _Calophyllum_ species, whilst PEOc _&ast;bakuRa_ probably denoted _Calophyllum kajewskii_.

[PMP &ast;_bitaquR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-3-153-POc-pitaqur-a)


<a id="p-154"></a>

The cognate set below supports the reconstruction of PMM _&ast;bu(y)ap_ '_Calophyllum inophyllum_'. If the Tokelauan form is also cognate, then the form can be reconstructed to POc. [Biggs & Clark](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)) attribute Tokelauan _pua_ to the cognate set reflecting PPn _&ast;pua_ '_Fagraea berteroana_ or other tree with showy flowers' (which I take to reflect POc _&ast;buRat_ '_Fagraea berteroana_'; [§5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-6#cldf:3-5)), but it may well be cognate with the Meso-Melanesian terms below.

[PMM &ast;_bu(y)ap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-3-154-PMM-buyap-a)

POc _&ast;tamanu_ evidently contrasted with _&ast;pitaquR_ '_Calophyllum inophyllum_', and probably denoted one of the tall inland species listed above, as suggested by the Mussau gloss. The Fijian and Niuean reflexes denote _Calophyllum vitiense_, one of these inland species.

[POc &ast;_tamanu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-3-154-POc-tamanu-a)

Although a number of the reflexes below are glossed _Calophyllum inophyllum_, the Gela and Sa'a reflexes point to an inland species, probably _Calophyllum kajewskii_, as the gloss of PEOc _&ast;bakuRa_.

[PEOc &ast;_bakuRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-3-154-PEOc-bakura-a)


<a id="p-155"></a>

The forms reconstructed below also denoted a _Calophyllum_ species.

PCEMP _&ast;talo_ is reconstructed on the basis of the data here and Ngadha (CMP) _talo_ '_Calophyllum inophyllum_' ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990)). PCP _&ast;dilo_ below may well be a case of chance resemblance, as the _-i-_ of the Central Pacific cognate set cannot be reconciled with the _-a-_ of the cognate set supporting POc _&ast;dalo_.

[PCEMP &ast;_talo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-3-155-POc-dalo-a)


<a id="p-156"></a>

The reconstruction below depends on the inference that Muyuw _apul_ is cognate with the two NNG items. From its sound correspondences _apul_ seems to be a borrowing from a Bwaidoga or Are-Taupota language; it is not directly inherited.

### 5.4. _Casuarina equisetifolia_, casuarina, beach she-oak, TP _yar_, B _aeantri_, _oktri_ (Casuarinaceae)


_Casuarina equisetifolia_ is a large coastal tree with an oddly feathery appearance caused by its needle-like leaves. Typically it grows to 20m, but Frederick Damon (pers.comm.) reports specimens on Woodlark Island of 40-45 m, towering above the rest of the forest. It yields heavy hard dark red-brown wood. The casuarina is used for building throughout most of NW Island Melanesia. In Kwara'ae country, clubs and axe handles are also made from it ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 123, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 143, [Whistler & Elevitch 2006b](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006b)).

<a id="fig-3-5_10"> </a>

[__Figure 5.10:__ _Casuarina equisetifolia_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_10)



The POc term for the casuarina was _&ast;aRu_, but a compound form can also be reconstructed, namely POc _&ast;aRu-taŋis_, consisting of _&ast;aRu_ plus _&ast;taŋis_ 'weep' - perhaps a metaphorical reference to the feathery and sometimes hanging foliage of the casuarina. However, I have no independent evidence of Oceanic speakers who make this connection.

The term for casuarina in Polynesian languages reflects PPn _&ast;toa_, itself a reflex of POc _&ast;toRas_ '_Intsia bijuga_' ([ch.7, §4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-9#cldf:3-7)). This shift in denotatum presumably reflects the fact that both the casuarina and _Intsia bijuga_ yield excellent hardwood.

So many reflexes of _&ast;aRu_ have an initial _y-_ (or other accretion) that it is tempting to reconstruct †_&ast;yaRu_. This would be an error, however. Frantisek [Lichtenberk](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Lichtenberk1988)) has shown the accretions in the SE Solomonic languages below are part of the regular reflexes of POc initial _&ast;a-_. The same is evidently true in many other Oceanic languages, as accretions occur regularly in this context, as illustrated by a number of items reconstructed in volumes 1 and 2 for which non-Oceanic evidence requires the reconstruction of POc initial _&ast;a-_.[^19]

To these may be added Ngaju Dayak _(kayu) walau_ ([Heyne 1950](Source#cldf:Heyne1950): 514). Although thin, the set allows the reconstruction of PMP/POc _&ast;pila(q)u_.

### 5.5. _Erythrina variegata_ (syn. _Erythrina indica_), coral tree, Indian coral tree, TP _palpal_, B _narara_ (Fabaceae)


Typically growing to 10-15 m, but sometimes to 20m, _Erythrina variegata_ ([Figure 5.11](#fig-3-5_11), left) occurs in two common forms. One has the variegated or yellowed leaves that have given rise to its name, as well as thorn-covered branches. The other form has green leaves and sometimes no thorns or just a few at the base of the trunk (Will McClatchey, pers. comm.). There are distinctive orange-red flowers in a spiral at the end of each branch. The bole is usually short and the trunk branches low with numerous ascending branches.

_Erythrina variegata_ is typically found in sandy soil in littoral forest, but it is also often planted as an ornamental tree and as a support for the betel vine ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 249, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 139-141, [Whistler & Elevitch 2006c](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006c)). [Gowers](Source#cldf:Gowers1976) ([1976](Source#cldf:Gowers1976): 75) - but not Wheatley - says that in Vanuatu it is an introduced tree, but the NCV and SV reflexes of POc _&ast;rarap_ '_Erythrina_ spp.' speak against this. Indeed, Vanuatu is one of the locations where the flowering of _Erythrina variegata_ is the marker of the yam-planting season ([ch.9, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-9)).

[__Figure 5.11:__ __Left__ _Erythrina variegata_, Indian coral tree. __Right__ _Fagraea berteroana_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_11)



Among the Nakanai _Erythrina variegata_ saplings are used to make pig spears and the leaves to dress wounds. It is widely used to make living fences ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989)). Boiled in coconut milk the leaves make an excellent vegetable. [Sorensen](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950) ([1950](Source#cldf:Sorensen1950)) writes that they are eaten by immigrants to Ninigo but not by its natives.

POc appears to have had two terms denoting _Erythrina variegata_, _&ast;[baR]baR_ and _&ast;rarap_, both inherited from PMP. Philippine cognates, however, suggest that PMP _&ast;baRbaR_[^21] denoted _Erythrina variegata_ and _&ast;dapdap_ one or more other species, as [Madulid](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b) ([2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 121) lists Ilokano _bakbak_ and Tagalog _bagbag_ as '_Erythrina variegata_' but Bagobo _dadap_ and Hiligaynon Bisayan _dapdap_ as '_Erythrina subumbrans_' and Tagalog _dapdap_ as '_Erythrina fusca_, _Erythrina subumbrans_'. _Erythrina fusca_ is a swamp species and _Erythrina subumbrans_ differs from other species in having flowers that are greenish to pale red ([Whistler & Elevitch 2006c](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006c)). It is thus likely that POc _&ast;rarap_ denoted a taxon of _Erythrina_ spp. rather than just _Erythrina variegata_.

[PMP &ast;_baRbaR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-5-159-POc-barbar-a)


<a id="p-160"></a>

As noted in [§4.1.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1-8#cldf:3-5), the expected reflex of POc _&ast;rarap_ 'Indian coral tree, _Erythrina variegata_' is PPn †_&ast;lala_, but this was replaced by PPn _&ast;ŋatae_, apparently because the PPn reflex of POc _&ast;drala_ 'a shrub, _Vitex trifolia_' was also _&ast;lala_.

[PMP &ast;_dapdap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-5-160-POc-rarap-a)


<a id="p-161"></a>

The forms Tawala _lawa-lawa_ and Roviana _rapo-rapo_ above suggest at first sight that the full reduplication of PMP _&ast;dapdap_ was exceptionally preserved in POc as †_&ast;raprap_. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1977a) ([1977a](Source#cldf:Blust1977a)) has shown that in reduplicated forms, as elsewhere, POc normally lost the first member of a medial consonant sequence. Hence POc _&ast;rarap_. Tawala and Roviana are both languages in which a vowel is added after a POc final consonant, and this vowel forms part of the reduplicand. The simplest interpretation is that _&ast;rarap_ was reduced to PWOc _&ast;rap_, then reduplicated again to avoid the monosyllabicity which POc abhorred. The Roviana form in any case looks like a borrowing from an unknown source (the expected form is †_&ast;ra[va]rava_).

### 5.6. _Fagraea berteroana_ (syn. _Fagraea peekelii_) (Loganiaceae)


Of the three species of _Fagraea_ that concern us here, one, _Fagraea berteroana_,[^23] grows in the Bismarcks ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 437) and is the principal denotatum of the reconstructions below ([Figure 5.11](#fig-3-5_11), right). A second, _Fagraea racemosa_ (syn. _Fagraea ligustrina_, _Fagraea maingayi_, _Fagraea pauciflora_) is not reported from the Bismarcks, although it is found on the New Guinea mainland and Bougainville and in the Solomons ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 171, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)). The third, _Fagraea gracilipes_, is reported only from the western Solomons and from Fiji ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 104, Capell1941).

_Fagraea berteroana_ takes several forms. Peekel describes two. In the Bismarcks it is either a foreshore shrub, 2-6 m tall, with no bole - it branches at ground level - or an epiphyte, growing on another tree, commonly _Inocarpus_, _Intsia_ or _Calophyllum_, without a stem of its own and without taking nutrients from its host. The epiphyte form is also described by [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 228) and mentioned by [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 146) and [Whistler & Elevitch](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006d) ([2006d](Source#cldf:WhistlerandElevitch2006d)). The latter two sources also describe a third form, a small tree growing to 15-20 m, with a bole that is rarely straight and often branches low. Frederick Damon (pers. comm.) reports that the bole is very durable and on Woodlark Island is sometimes used for houseposts instead of _Intsia bijuga_. In whatever form, _Fagraea berteroana_ has wonderfully scented tubular white flowers which are white for the first two days, turning yolk-yellow on days 3 and 4. Its wood is light brown and durable.

_Fagraea racemosa_ resembles the small-tree form of _Fagraea berteroana_, ranging from 2 to 10m in height, and occasionally reaching 16m. ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 171, [Conn & Damas 2006](Source#cldf:ConnandDamas2006)). _Fagraea gracilipes_ is a lowland forest tree that grows in swamps or mud ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 104). It is effectively in complementary distribution with _Fagraea racemosa_, which abhors such habitats.

The three species are apparently used in much the same ways. The flowers serve as personal decoration. Posts cut from _Fagraea_ shrubs are used to establish living fences. _Fagraea_ poles are used in canoe and house construction at a number of locations, e.g. SE Papua New Guinea ([Kinch 1999](Source#cldf:Kinch1999)) and parts of the Solomons ([Waterhouse 1949](Source#cldf:Waterhouse1949), [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 171), because the branches grow straight and erect and, according to [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 102, 104, 110), the wood never rots and is resistant to white ants. Hviding and Capell report that _Fagraea gracilipes_ is used for house posts at Marovo and in Fiji respectively, [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 146, 148) that _Fagraea berteroana_ is similarly used in Vanuatu, and especially on Aneityum.


<a id="p-162"></a>

In the light of these observations the etymon below may be identical with POc _&ast;bou_, denoting the main bearers or central post of a house ([vol.1, ch.3, §3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:1-3)). The Sye cognate apparently denotes two tree species, neither of them a _Fagraea_ species, but both are used for house construction. It is also possible that _&ast;bou_ may be identical with _&ast;bau_ 'hardwood taxon' ([ch. 7, §4.10](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-10#cldf:3-7)), given that almost all the examples supporting the latter are from Central Pacific languages and may reflect a change of denotation in PCP.

[POc &ast;_bou_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-6-162-POc-bou-a)

PPn _&ast;pou-muli_ '_Flueggea flexuosa_' was apparently a compound reflecting POc _&ast;bou_ '_Fagraea_ spp.' as its first element and POc _&ast;muri[-]_ 'back part, rear' ([vol.2, ch.8, §2.3.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-3-7#cldf:2-8)) as its second. We assume the association in meaning was that the tree(s) denoted by reflexes of POc _&ast;bou_ and by PPn _&ast;pou-muli_ were all used in house-building. [Milner](Source#cldf:Milner1966) ([1966](Source#cldf:Milner1966)) notes that in Samoa the Flueggea species denoted by _pou-muli_ provided timber 'used for outrigger booms, house posts etc.'.

[PPn &ast;_pou-muli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-5-5-6-162-PPn-poumuli-a)

POc _&ast;buRat_ was apparently the specific term for _Fagraea berteroana_. Central Pacific reflexes quite often instead denote _Guettarda speciosa_, another plant with sweet-smelling flowers but a quite different appearance. [Pawley & Sayaba](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)) gloss the Wayan reflex as denoting a taxon including various species that have pretty and sweet-scented flowers. If PCP _&ast;bua_ had such a range of meaning, then the application of its reflexes to _Guettarda_ speciosa is readily explained. However, things were apparently more complicated than this, as a reduplicated PCP form _&ast;bua-bua_ is also reconstructable and it is not clear how this differed in meaning from _&ast;bua_. PCEMP _&ast;buRat_ is perhaps also reconstructable in the light of a single putative cognate, Ende _bore_ (Flores, CMP; [Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 213).

### 5.7. _Flueggea flexuosa_ (syn. _Securinega flexuosa_), B _namemiwa_, _namamao_ (Euphorbiaceae)


_Flueggea flexuosa_ is a medium-sized tree of 10-15 m which grows on coral in coastal locations and also, in the Solomons, in lowland forests. Its natural range extends from the Philippines to northern Vanuatu, but it is absent from New Guinea and the Bismarcks ([Thomson 2006b](Source#cldf:Thomson2006b)).

It provides moderately heavy hard straight wood which is slow to rot in contact with dry soil. It is considered to be among the best building timbers in the Solomons and so is used for posts and for house construction by the Nduke, as well as for pig fences. It is best for largescale construction, since it cracks as it dries, and for this reason is not used for carving ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 107, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 129, [Scales n.d.](Source#cldf:Scalesnd)). At Marovo scrapings of the bark are an ingredient in many medicines.

<a id="fig-3-5_12"> </a>

[__Figure 5.12:__ _Flueggea flexuosa_: tree and fruit-bearing shoot.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_12)



Although the Madak reflex refers to _Falcataria moluccana_, a tree vastly different in size (at 60 m the tallest in the forest), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 107) perceive its leaves to be similar to the leaves of _Flueggea flexuosa_.

The gloss of POc _&ast;mapuqan_ is marked as doubtful below because _Flueggea flexuosa_ was apparently not present in the Bismarcks and thus perhaps unknown to POc speakers. However, this is problematic, as regular reflexes denote _Flueggea flexuosa_ in NW Solomonic, SE Solomonic and North-Central Vanuatu languages, and the most recent interstage that these groups are commonly descended from is POc. (For Polynesian terms for _Flueggea flexuosa_, see [§5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-6#cldf:3-5).)

### 5.8. _Guettarda speciosa_ (Rubiaceae)


_Guettarda speciosa_ is a hardwood tree with a short bole that grows to a height of 3-12 m in a variety of coastal habitats. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 151) reports that at Marovo it grows on the landward margin of the mangrove swamp and is tolerant of salt water. It is included here among littoral forest trees because [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 533) writes that in New Ireland it is '[c]ommon on the foreshore; as abundant on the cliffs as on the sand'. [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 198) reports that it is infrequent in Vanuatu.

This tree has a number of uses: in the small islands of the Calvados chain (off the southeastern tip of the New Guinea mainland) it is used in house construction ([Kinch 1999](Source#cldf:Kinch1999)). At Marovo it is used for firewood and for making barkcloth mallets ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 151).

<a id="fig-3-5_13"> </a>

[__Figure 5.13:__ _Guettarda speciosa_ .](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_13)



_Guettarda speciosa_ is sometimes labelled with the same term as the epiphyte _Fagraea berteroana_, apparently because both are sweet-smelling ([§5.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-6#cldf:3-5)), but the POc term for _Guettarda speciosa_ was _&ast;pʷano_ or _&ast;pʷano-pʷano_.

<a id="s-5-9"></a>

### 5.9. _Gyrocarpus americanus_, canoe tree, B _naove_, _kenutri_ (Hernandiaceae)


[Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 114) comments that the canoe tree, _Gyrocarpus americanus_, is a key indicator of a region with a distinct dry season. It is confined to coastal strips and low coral plateaus which lie in a rain shadow during the drier season when the SE trades are prevalent. Because of its location and because its soft wood is easily worked, it is the tree from which dugout canoes are made in north and central Vanuatu - and this is its only use. It is used for the same purpose in New Ireland ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 192). On Waya Island the soft wood was used to construct simple in-shore fishing rafts, and the bark was made into a tonic and medicine for high blood pressure ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

The canoe tree grows to a height of 30-40 m. It has a smooth grey-brown trunk, which can be huge (Peekel reports a specimen 8.25 m in diameter), and a sparse crown which loses its leaves in the dry season.

According to Peekel, the leaves and the flowers both smell unpleasant, the leaves like garlic, the flowers acrid, hence its name in Patpatar, _i-bore_, and Tolai, _i-boroi_, literally 'pig tree'.

POc _&ast;qope_ appears to have been the term for _Gyrocarpus americanus_. Only one reliable reflex is outside NCV, namely Titan _ñow_. Titan _ñ-_ reflects Proto Admiralty _&ast;n-q-_, where _&ast;n-_ in turn reflects the POc article _&ast;na_ which in Admiralties languages often combines with the initial consonant of a noun ([Ross 1988](Source#cldf:Ross1988): 340--341). The phonological history of Drehet is not sufficiently well known to be sure whether Drehet _nip_ also reflects _&ast;qope_.

<a id="s-5-10"></a>

### 5.10. _Neisosperma oppositifolium_ (syn. _Ochrosia oppositifolia_, _Ochrosia parviflora_), twin apple, B _tufrut_ (Apocynaceae)


Perhaps because of a lack of relevant data, no POc term is reconstructable for _Neisosperma oppositifolium_ although it occurs in the Bismarcks. A small tree restricted to the coastal edge of the littoral forest and growing to 5-8m, it has dense clusters of white flowers a centimetre in diameter at the ends of its branches and pairs of fruit which in shape and size resemble a betelnut with a pointed and slightly turned tip. Hence its Kwara'ae name _ai-kikiru_ 'betel tree' (_kikiru_ 'betelnut palm, _Areca catechu_). Internally the fruit is betelnut-like, too: it has a thick dry husk enclosing the nut which contains two seeds.


<a id="p-167"></a>

The tree provides good straight poles for the lighter parts of house construction, as well as being good firewood. The thick latex beneath the outer bark has medicinal uses ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):443-445, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):48-50, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 124, [Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

At present no term is reconstructable at an interstage earlier than PROc _&ast;vaRo_. Gedaged (NNG) _faɬoŋ_ 'tree sp., the trunk of which is used to make canoes' looks cognate but reflects POc †_&ast;pa(r,R)oŋV_, which has an extra syllable not reflected in the Remote Oceanic cognate set.

The PSOc form _&ast;vato_, reconstructed by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)), seems to be an irregular reflex of PROc _&ast;vaRo_.

<a id="s-5-11"></a>

### 5.11. _Pisonia_ spp. (syn. _Ceodes_ spp.), B _nambuka_, _sofsofwud_ (Nyctaginaceae)


Two species of _Pisonia_ occur in the Bismarcks: _Pisonia umbellifera_ (syn. _Pisonia excelsa_, _Pisonia brunoniana_) and _Pisonia grandis_ ([Figure 5.14](#fig-3-5_14), left). The main difference between them is their habitat. _Pisonia umbellifera_ is common in secondary forest, whilst _Pisonia grandis_ is confined to the littoral strip, just above the high-water mark. In Vanuatu it is occasionally cultivated in coastal villages.

Both are trees growing to 10-20m in height, with a bole which divides low into several erect branches. Both species have sweet-smelling white flowers. Their fruit are narrow (2-5 mm across) and cylindical (3cm long) and have a sticky exudate which attaches them to anything, including bird feathers. Their soft wood is useless, even as fuel, but the fruit were traditionally used in bird traps. The leaves of _Pisonia grandis_ were consumed as a vegetable in Vanuatu ([Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 186--189).


<a id="p-168"></a>

Two forms denoting _Pisonia_ species are reconstructable. POc _&ast;[a]nuliŋ_ may well have denoted both _Pisonia_ species. PEOc _&ast;buka_ evidently denoted a taxon of littoral trees, including _Pisonia_ species and _Gyrocarpus americanus_, expanded in PCP to include _Hernandia nymphaeifolia_.[^26]

<a id="s-5-12"></a>

### 5.12. _Pongamia pinnata_ (syn. _Pongamia glabra_) (Fabaceae)


_Pongamia pinnata_ is a beach tree, 5-10 m tall, with white flowers ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 241). Its crushed roots are sometimes used as fish poison, which explains why the Marovo call it _tuva_ (reflecting POc _&ast;tupa_ '_Derris_ sp.'), as _Derris_ is the commonest fish poison in NW Island Melanesia. The Nakanai also used the crushed leaves for medicinal purposes ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 188-149).

<a id="fig-3-5_15"> </a>

[__Figure 5.15:__ _Pongamia pinnata_.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-5_15)



The only POc candidate for a name for _Pongamia pinnata_ is _&ast;pesi_. It is clear from the glosses below that it denoted a coastal forest tree (or a taxon of such trees). On the evidence of Wayan Fijian, its PCP reflex denoted a taxon of coastal forest trees, including _Pongamia pinnata_ and _Intsia bijuga_ (and in Polynesian languages its denotation is limited to the latter). With only one cognate (Teop) outside Central Pacific, it is difficult to know whether the denotatum of _&ast;pesi_ was _Pongamia pinnata_ alone, or a taxon as in Wayan.

POLLEX2 and [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 90) compare PCP _&ast;vesi_ with Malay _besi_ 'iron' and related forms, but it is unlikely that POc _&ast;pesi_ / PCP _&ast;vesi_ reflects PMP _besi_ 'iron', as this would give POc †_&ast;posi_ / PCP †_&ast;vosi_. Geraghty suggests that it reflects a borrowing from a Western Malaya-Polynesian language, but this seems implausible in the light of the evidence below.

### 5.13. _Premna_ spp. (Verbenaceae)


Two _Premna_ species concern us here. _Premna integrifolia_ (syn. _Premna divaricata_) is reported in the Bismarcks, _Premna corymbosa_ (syn. _Premna serratifolia_) in the Solomons and Vanuatu ([Figure 5.14](#fig-3-5_14), right).[^27] Both are small trees, 4--8 m tall, usually growing immediately behind the beach, although _Premna integrifolia_ is reportedly also found in primary forest. At Marovo _Premna corymbosa_ grows mainly on coral islets on ocean-facing reefs, typically together with _Pemphis acidula_.

Both _Premna_ species tend to branch at the base, with several erect branches, but sometimes they sprawl horizontally. They have hard yellowish wood, white flowers and blue-black to black berries 6--9 mm across, reminiscent of European elderflower and elderberries ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):479, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988):169-171, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):244, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 164, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 107-108).

Sometimes planted as live fences, _Premna_ species provide rafters and fast-burning wood for the cooking fire. They are particularly known, however, for two uses: they provide good wood for traditional fireploughs, and they are commonly used for various medicinal purposes. A common cure for headache is to insert heated leaves and shoots in the nose or to inhale the vapour from a hot infusion. The leaves and shoots are also used to treat pain by rubbing them on the afflicted body part. [Arentz et al.](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989) ([1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 91) also report that the leaves are boiled and the infusion is drunk against diarrhoea.

The POc term was _&ast;arop_, with a reduplicated reflex in PCP (and Bugotu). In Proto Polynesian an alternant _&ast;walo-walo_ appears alongside _&ast;alo-alo_. This may have been the result of glide epenthesis, i.e. _&ast;alo-w-alo_, followed by reanalysis of _&ast;-w-_ as part of the root and its inclusion in reduplication, giving _&ast;walo-walo_.

## Notes

[^1]: I am grateful to Will McClatchey for elucidating this contrast.

[^2]: Except where otherwise indicated, this introduction is based on material in [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 50--70).

[^3]: The form of the reconstruction is puzzling, as it appears to contain the labialised velar _&ast;gʷ_, but this POc phoneme has not previously been reconstructed. How this should be interpreted is not yet clear.

[^4]: Presumably an _Ipomoea_ sp.

[^5]: Possibly _Ipomoea pes-caprae_.

[^6]: [Wolff](Source#cldf:Wolff1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Wolff1994)) argues that this term should not be reconstructed for PMP but started its life somewhere in eastern Indonesia and spread in non-Oceanic languages by borrowing. However, the [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995) includes Palauan _kelau_ '_Cordia_ sebestena', which supports the PMP reconstruction.

[^7]: According to [Madulid](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a) ([2001a](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a): 104) Tagalog _banago_, reflecting PMP _&ast;banaRo_ '_Thespesia populnea_', is used for both species.

[^8]: [Gardner & Pawley](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)) record Wayan _vau_ for both _Hibiscus tiliaceus_ and _Kleinhovia hospita_. This homonymy has arisen through consonant losses in two POc etyma, _&ast;paRu_ '_Hibiscus tiliaceus_' and _&ast;paqu_ '_Kleinhovia hospita_'.

[^9]: PMP _&ast;ŋiRaj_ is reconstructed above on the basis of the data here, Palauan _ŋis_ '_Pemphis acidula_' (noted by [Geraghty 1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990)) and Ilokano _ŋirad_ 'Pemphis sp.' ([Madulid 2001a](Source#cldf:Madulid2001a)).

[^10]: PMP _&ast;banaRo_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic data here, plus Pangasinan _banaro_, Panay Bisayan _banago_, Hanunuo _banagu_, Kuyonon _banag_, Tagbanwa _banaw_, all '_Thespesia populnea_' ([Madulid 2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 204).

[^11]: [Kwa'ioloa and Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001):123, 132) gloss _milo_ as '_Elaeocarpus angustifolius_' and '_Trema aspera_' .

[^12]: Bauan _drala_ '_Erythrina variegata_' results from the application to PCP _&ast;rara_, from POc _&ast;rarap_, of eastern Fijian apical prenasalisation, a process entailing prenasalisation of the initial apical consonant of a noun following the common noun article _na_ ([Geraghty 1983](Source#cldf:Geraghty1983): 74--96).

[^13]: The authors of POLLEX assume that PPn _&ast;lala_ '_Vitex trifolia_' reflects the transfer of the term for _Erythrina_ variegata to _Vitex trifolia_. As the data here show, this assumption is incorrect.

[^14]: POc _&ast;w_ is lost in NW Solomonic languages; final _-a_ is a predictable echo vowel. Kokota _n-_ reflects the accreted article POc _&ast;na_.

[^15]: I am grateful to Will McClatchey for drawing my attention to this possibility.

[^16]: These similarities lead to disagreements among listings of names: an APNI entry identifies _Barringtonia racemosa_ with _Barringtonia edulis_, whereas an IPNI entry identifies it with _Barringtonia speciosa_ (= asiatica).

[^17]: Initial _&ast;vu-_ here is not related to the prefix _vu-_ 'tree counter' which occurs in various North Vanuatu languages ([ch.2, §7.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1-3#cldf:3-2)).

[^18]: Probably borrowed from Fijian ([Geraghty 2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 84).

[^19]: In vol. 1, _&ast;asa(q)_ 'grate, sharpen' ([ch. 9, §2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-9)), _&ast;asu_ 'ladle, bailer' ([ch. 7, §7.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-4#cldf:3-7)); in vol. 2, _&ast;alito(n)_ 'firebrand' ([ch. 3, §8.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-2#cldf:3-3)), _&ast;anin_ 'wind' ([ch. 5, §4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:3-5)), _&ast;aparat_ 'NW wind' ([ch. 5, §4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-5)), _&ast;api_ 'fire' ([ch. 3, §8 .1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8-1#cldf:3-3)), _&ast;atas_ 'top, space above' ([ch. 8, §2.2.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-6#cldf:3-8)).

[^20]: Nduke and Roviana naru seems to be a borrowing from a (now lost?) language retaining the POc article _&ast;na_ on nouns.

[^21]: PMP _&ast;baRbaR_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Ilokano, Tagalog and Oceanic forms listed here.

[^22]: The final _-am_ of Gitua _baram_ is unexplained, but the non-Oceanic evidence indicates that it does not reflect part of the POc form.

[^23]: Also sometimes spelled _berteriana_ or _berterana_ in the literature, but IPNI and APNI give _berteroana_. The species name is derived from the French surname Berteron.

[^24]: Tagbanwa _banayon_ ([Madulid 2001b](Source#cldf:Madulid2001b): 150) appears to reflect a possible PMP _&ast;banayen_. If this is ancestral to the forms listed here, then the POc form was _&ast;(p,b)an(e)on_, with possible deletion of _&ast;-e-_ because the sequence _&ast;-eo-_ was not a part of POc phonotactics.

[^25]: Recorded by [Wheatley](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 198), but not by [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)). Spelling may be incorrect.

[^26]: This assumes that the terms in the cognate set are all correctly glossed.

[^27]: A third species, _Premna taitensis_, is apparently native to eastern Polynesia.

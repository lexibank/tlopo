## 1. Introduction


Mangrove forests are located on the strip of waterlogged land between mean sea level and the highest tide levels. Mangrove plants thrive in this intertidal zone because they are salt-tolerant, but they also require a supply of fresh water. One salt-resisting mechanism is ultrafiltration, which costs the plant no energy but removes sodium and chloride ions from seawater as it is absorbed for normal physiological processes. Mangrove plants are popularly recognised by the stilt roots characteristic of trees toward the seaward margin of the swamp. The exposed roots have special lenticels (pore-like structures) which enable them to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen, allowing them to survive in anaerobic soils, while flooding tides bring water-borne nutrients and disperse their buoyant seeds ([Duke 2006](Source#cldf:Duke2006)). Not all mangroves have stilt roots, however.

Serious deforestation of the intertidal zone occurred on many Pacific islands after the arrival of European colonisers, thanks to a perception that mangrove areas were unproductive marginal lands ([Thaman 1994](Source#cldf:Thaman1994): 157), but [Hviding's](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005)) study of plant use on Marovo Lagoon shows vividly that this perception was false: the trees and shrubs of the mangrove swamp have numerous and often important uses for Oceanic speakers. The larger trees provide strong building materials and good and abundant fuel for cooking fires, and their fruits provide food.

Mangrove forests occur on stretches of coastline sheltered from wave action, along estuaries, and occasionally on coral reefs that are protected from the surf. A mangrove swamp needs regular rainfall to wash salt out of the soil, which is inundated with sea water at high tide twice a day. Inundation on the seaward edge lasts longer and is normally deeper than on the landward side. This means that growing conditions change progressively as one moves landward. The soil is saltiest on the seaward edge and least salty on the landward side, where there is usually an abrupt transition to freshwater swamp forest.

This means that species that thrive on the seaward edge need to be the most adapted to waterlogged conditions and do not necessarily occur on the landward margin. Species on the landward margin often also grow in freshwater swamp or lowland rainforest. Biogeographic literature divides the gradient from the seaward to the landward margin into three or four bands, although these obviously shade into each other. A convenient division is (a) the seaward edge; (b) the _Rhizophora_ zone; (c) the _Bruguiera_ zone; and (d) the landward margin ([Lear & Turner 1977](Source#cldf:LearandTurner1977)). Sources describing mangrove forests in the Bismarcks and the Solomons generally agree as to which species are common in which band.


<a id="p-174"></a>

Common species of the seaward edge are _Avicennia marina_ (the white/grey mangrove), _Sonneratia caseolaris_, _Sonneratia alba_ and sometimes _Ceriops tagal_ (the yellow mangrove). I am unable to reconstruct labels for any of these species. The major proximate reason for this is that even sources that provide plant names aplenty often give only a generic term for mangroves. Sometimes this is because they are simply unknown to speakers because there are no mangrove swamps nearby or because these species do not grow in local swamps. But it is also likely that names for these species have often not been collected because of their relative inaccessibility to landbased fieldworkers who have no particular interest in the swamp environment.

Behind the seaward edge the outer zone of the mangrove forest consists generally of _Rhizophora_ species ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-6)).

Behind the _Rhizophora_ zone the mangrove forest canopy begins to assume the stature of a land-based forest as _Bruguiera_ species ([§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-6)) take over from _Rhizophora_. Depending on local conditions, _Ceriops tagal_ sometimes occurs between _Bruguiera_ and the landward margin.

<a id="fig-3-6_1"> </a>

On the landward margin the mangrove forest becomes more diverse, forming a canopy up to 25 m tall, which in the Bismarcks includes _Camptostemon schultzii_ (no reconstruction), _Cerbera manghas_ ([§4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:3-6)), _Excoecaria agallocha_ ([§4.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3#cldf:3-6)), _Heritiera littoralis_ ([§4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:3-6)), _Inocarpus fagifer_ ([ch. 11, §2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:3-11)), _Intsia bijuga_ ([ch.7, §4.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-9#cldf:3-7)), _Lumnitzera littorea_ (no reconstruction) and _Xylocarpus granatum_ ([§4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6#cldf:3-6)). _Intsia bijuga_ and _Inocarpus fagifer_ are also common lowland swamp forest and rain forest trees and the latter is also a nut tree. They are not treated here but in chapters 7 and 11 respectively. Because the landward margin of the mangrove forest is more open, it has an undergrowth of shrubs and low-stature trees including _Dolichandrone spathacea_ ([§4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-6)) and _Myristica hollrungii_ (no reconstruction). The _Nypa fruticans_ palm also grows on the landward side of estuarine swamps ([§4.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-5#cldf:3-6)) ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976):31-34, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](Source#cldf:MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998):50--5 1).

The following sections present reconstructions for plants which grow in the _Rhizophora_ ([§2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2#cldf:3-6)) and _Bruguiera_ ([§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:3-6)) zones of the mangrove forest and on the landward margin ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-6)).

## 2. The _Rhizophora_ zone of the mangrove forest



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. _Rhizophora_ spp., P _manguru_, B _natongtong_ (Rhizophoraceae)



<a id="p-175"></a>

The outer zone of the mangrove forest in the Bismarcks and the Solomons is dominated by trees of the genus _Rhizophora_, in the Bismarcks usually by _Rhizophora apiculata_, known as the tall-stilted mangrove or prop-root mangrove, which usually grows to between 5 and 8 min height, but can grow as tall as 40 m. The trunk is usually not erect and branches irregularly.

_Rhizophora apiculata_ is also found in the Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. There are two other, rather similar, Indo-Pacific _Rhizophora_ species, _Rhizophora mucronata_, which does not grow east of the Bismarcks, and _Rhizophora stylosa_, the red mangrove, whose range stretches to western Polynesia.

The pale yellow flowers of _Rhizophora apiculata_ grow in pairs just below the base of the leaf stalk. The mature fruit are irregular ovoids (shaped like an upsidedown pear) and grow to around 4--5 em. All _Rhizophora_ species are viviparous, i.e. the seed, hidden in the mature fruit, germinates on the tree and produces a hypocotyl, a viviparous seedling, which eventually falls into the mud below. Hypocotyls are long narrow green cylindrical structures with irregular small brown lenticels (pores). They vary in length from 15 to 80 cm but are only about 2cm in diameter at their widest point ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 400--401, [Duke 2006](Source#cldf:Duke2006)).

The Bola of New Britain use _Rhizophora_ species as building timber ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976)). On Waya Island, Fiji, the roots were used to make baskets and fish-traps, and the bark was boiled to give a red dye which was also used as a preservative for ropes. The crushed tips of the roots provided medicine for thrush and coughs ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

The Proto Oceanic (POc) term for _Rhizophora_ species was perhaps POc _&ast;wako(t)_, repeated here from [ch.4, §2.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-4#cldf:3-4). Since it is _Rhizophora_ species that have stilt roots, it is likely that the intended meaning of 'mangrove' in these glosses is _Rhizophora_, and the glosses of the Tawala, Mokilese and Ponapean reflexes suggest that POc _&ast;wako(t)_ may have been used metonymically for the whole tree and not just the roots.

[PMP &ast;_waket_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-6-2-1-175-POc-wakot-a)

PWOc _&ast;baul_ perhaps denoted _Rhizophora_: its Tolai reflex, _baul_ 'mangrove, _Rhizophora_ apiculata', contrasts with _toŋor_, the generic term for mangroves including both _Rhizophora_ and _Bruguiera_ species.

[PWOc &ast;_baul_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-6-2-1-175-PWOc-baul-a)

As a generic, Saliba _pauli_ includes _Ceriops tagal_, _Rhizophora_ spp. and _Bruguiera_ spp. (Margetts 2005h).


<a id="p-176"></a>


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. The _Bruguiera_ zone of the mangrove forest



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. _Bruguiera_ spp., P _ko'a_ (Rhizophoraceae)


In the Bismarcks _Bruguiera gymnorrhiza_, the orange or large-leafed mangrove, dominates the inner zone of the mangrove forest. It often grows in stiff mud, as well as in tidal areas, and tolerates a wide range of salinity levels. It contrasts sharply in appearance with _Rhizophora apiculata_, as it is taller, 15-30 m tall, and has an erect trunk and regularly arranged lateral branches. Its rounded or plank-like buttresses branch over and over again as they near the ground. Sometimes there are also stilt roots. Traditionally, the fruit was rarely eaten. When it was, it was processed to remove the tannin, then cooked in coconut cream as a vegetable ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 105, 107, [Allen & Duke 2006](Source#cldf:AllenandDuke2006)).

<a id="fig-3-6_2"> </a>

[__Figure 6.2:__ _Bruguiera gymnorrhiza_, orange mangrove: __A__, tree; __B__, shoot bearing edible fruit.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-6_2)



The wood of _Bruguiera gymnorrhiza_ is hard, but it is not durable in water and is therefore used only for internal construction, e.g. rafters. It is also used to make charcoal ([Streicher 1982](Source#cldf:Streicher1982), [Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 400). The Nakanai also use it for axe handles and digging sticks ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)). In areas where people depend on sago because they have little dryland agriculture, sprouted _Bruguiera_ fruits are sometimes collected and subjected to lengthy processing so that they can be eaten ([Barrau 1955](Source#cldf:Barrau1955): 25-26). The bark was used as an abortifacient in Malaita and for the treatment of bums in the western Solomons.

POc _&ast;toŋoR_ was fairly clearly the generic term for mangroves. It also seems to have been the term for _Bruguiera_ species. This is the denotatum of its reflexes in non-Oceanic languages and in some of the Oceanic languages listed below (and I suspect that where the gloss is simply 'mangrove', this is sometimes simply the result of poor glossing).

## 4. The landward margin of the mangrove forest


The landward margin of the mangrove forest looks more like a dryland rain forest than a mangrove swamp. Indeed, apart from _Excoecaria agallocha_, the plants below are described as growing 'behind' mangroves, i.e. behind the various stilt-rooted species. They are trees of the foreshore or the freshwater swamp rather than specialised plants of the mangrove swamp. The landward margin is more diverse, and accommodates an understorey which includes _Dolichandrone spathacea_ ([§4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-6)). Not all prominent plants of the landward margin have reconstructable POc labels. Terms for _Lumnitzera littorea_, _Camptostemon schultzii_ and _Myristica hollrungii_ cannot at present be reconstructed.


<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. _Cerbera_ spp. (Apocynaceae)


Three _Cerbera_ species are associated with mangrove swamps. All three grow in coastal locations and are often associated with muddy habitats. Two, _Cerbera manghas_ and _Cerbera floribunda_, are similar to each other, and some languages treat them as a single taxon. They are trees 10-20 m tall and about a metre in girth. The third, _Cerbera odollam_, is a large shrub or small tree about 10m in height. All three have shiny green leaves and sweet-scented white flowers with a red (_Cerbera manghas_) or yellow (_Cerbera odollam_) centre. The seed is surrounded by a thick fibrous husk which gives the fruit buoyancy and makes for easy dispersal on ocean currents.

The genus is named after Cerberus, the Greek mythological dog of Hades, because all its parts are highly toxic: they contain cerberin, a substance that blocks electric impulses in mammals, including the heart beat. Even smoke from burning _Cerbera_ wood is toxic. In parts of the Pacific _Cerbera_ sap was used to poison animals and people ([Powell 1976](Source#cldf:Powell1976), [Tomlinson 1986](Source#cldf:Tomlinson1986)). [Whistler](Source#cldf:Whistler1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Whistler1992)) reports that the fruit was eaten by suicides in the Marquesas. On Waya Island an extract of the bark in oil was used to exorcise demons ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

<a id="fig-3-6_3"> </a>

[__Figure 6.3:__ _Cerbera_ odollam: bottom left, longitudinal section of fruit.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-6_3)



Two reconstructions are presented below: PWOc _&ast;(p,pʷ)awa(t)_ '_Cerbera_ spp., probably _Cerbera floribunda_ and _Cerbera manghas_' and PCP _&ast;rewa_ 'tree, _Cerbera_ sp., probably _Cerbera_ odollam'. [Milke](Source#cldf:Milke1968) ([1968](Source#cldf:Milke1968)) also offers POc _&ast;pasa_ '_Cerbera_ sp.', based on Gedaged _safa_ (metathesis), Bauan _vasa_ '_Cerbera odollam_', Samoan _fasa_, 'Uvea'[^1] _faha_, both 'variety of pandanus'. The alleged metathesis and the semantic discrepancies make cognacy too uncertain for one to accept this reconstruction without further comparisons.


<a id="p-179"></a>

The initial rounded bilabial of POc _&ast;(p,pʷ)awa(t)_ is reconstructed on the basis of Teop _p-_ (the usual Teop reflex of _&ast;p_ is _v-_. The final _&ast;-t_ is uncertain because it is reflected in Misima, but not where it is also expected, in Teop, Nduke, Roviana and Marovo.

[PCP &ast;_rewa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-6-4-1-179-PCP-rewa-a)


<a id="s-4-2"></a>

### 4.2. _Dolichandrone spathacea_ (syn. _Bignonia spathacea_) (Bignoniaceae)


A tree of the understorey, 5-12 m tall, _Dolichandrone spathacea_ grows behind mangroves and around the swampy mouths of streams from India to New Caledonia. Its fruit are up to 45cm long, flattened and curved like a bean pod with dark grey squarish seeds with thick corky wings. The large white flowers open after sunset and fall in the morning.

It is used in New Ireland to make propeller-like shark fishing floats ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 508). In Marovo the wood is used for various canoe parts and sometimes for carving ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 148) and in parts of Melanesia is used for hourglass drums ([Record 1945](Source#cldf:Record1945)). The Nakanai rub the bark on dermatitis and grille (_Tinea imbricata_, a disfiguring fungal skin infection) ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)).

<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. _Excoecaria agallocha_, milky mangrove (Euphorbiaceae)


_Excoecaria agallocha_ is a shrub or small tree with a thick trunk that mostly grows in saltwater inland of A vicennia, _Rhizophora_ and _Bruguiera_ species ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984):316, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 135). According to Hviding the sap is harmful to people's eyes. He also notes that its dead, dry wood is very good for slow-burning firesticks and for fuel for cooking fires. On New Britain an infusion made from the leaves is mixed with the sap of a Liliaceae species and used against fever ([Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 91).

<a id="fig-3-6_4"> </a>

[__Figure 6.4:__ _Excoecaria agallocha_, milky mangrove.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-6_4)



[Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)) reconstructs PSOc _&ast;(t,d)oto(q)_, noting, 'Final _&ast;-o_ is overtly reflected in at least Lenakel and the New Caledonian languages, suggesting final _&ast;-q_.' I reconstruct POc _&ast;dotoq_ 'sticky liquids including the sap of (some?) trees'; 'a mangrove tree, probably _Excoecaria agallocha_' with initial _&ast;d-_ and final _&ast;-q_ because it appears to be an irregular reflex (for expected POc †_&ast;ditoq_) of PAn _&ast;diteq_ 'sticky substance' (ACD). There are two sets of reasons for thinking that items meaning 'sticky sap' and items denoting _Excoecaria agallocha_ (or in some cases _Cerbera manghas_, also a mangrove) reflect the same POc etymon.

- In the cognate set below, Marovo _ototo_ '_Excoecaria agallocha_' and Kwara'ae _toto(ŋʷala)_ '_Cerbera manghas_' are descriptive terms which allude to sticky sap. According to Hviding the Marovo name _ototo_ means 'with much sap', an assertion supported by the fact that in closely related Nduke _oto-_ means the 'sap or gum of trees and some fruits'.[^2] [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 162) gloss _toto(ŋʷala)_ as 'sticky sap; _Cerbera manghas_'.

- Reflexes in the cognate set below share in irregular developments which affect reflexes of POc _&ast;dotoq_ 'sticky liquids …'. Kwara'ae _toto(ŋʷala)_ reflects PSES _&ast;soso_ 'sap'[^3] instead of expected PSES †_&ast;doto_. Most other reflexes share in a voicing assimilation which reflects a variant _&ast;totoq_. This idiosyncratic change affects both reflexes glossed 'sticky sap'[^4] and reflexes glossed '_Excoecaria agallocha_' (below), suggesting that they are indeed the same term.

### 4.4. _Heritiera littoralis_ (Sterculiaceae)


_Heritiera littoralis_ typically grows in sand at the high-tide limit of estuaries and mangrove swamps in the Bismarcks, the Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Up to 25m tall, it has a short bole, straight trunk, planklike buttresses, and large conspicuous hard brown nuts about 7cm long and 4cm in diameter. Its wood is very strong when it has dried out, and is used among other things for rafters, planks and spear shafts ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 374, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992):223-225, [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 136, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 101).

<a id="fig-3-6_5"> </a>

[__Figure 6.5:__ _Heritiera littoralis_](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-6_5)



The cognate set below has few members, but they are widespread enough to support a POc reconstruction which entails the POc term _&ast;qone_ 'sand, sandy beach' or _&ast;qone-qone_ 'sandy' (vo1.2, [ch.3, §7.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-5#cldf:3-3)). If the interpretation of the Patpatar prefix _i-_ offered in [chapter 2, §7.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-1#cldf:3-2) is correct, then Patpatar _i-kon_ points to POc _&ast;kayu qone_, 'tree of beach, beach tree'. Although Tolai _ka-_ is not a regular prefix in tree names, it quite possibly reflects _&ast;kayu_ in this instance, as the latter must have been an intrinsic part of the name. Nyelayu _kʰon_ reflects _&ast;kV-kon_ at a recent interstage and has a history like that of the Tolai reflex. PSES _&ast;(q)one-(q)one_ reflects POc _&ast;qone-qone_ 'sandy'.

<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. _Nypa fruticans_, nipa(h) palm (Arecaceae)


The nipa palm, _Nypa fruticans_, grows from the Bismarcks to Fiji in soft mud and slow moving tidal and river waters that bring in nutrients. It is the only palm (member of the Palmae family) that is also a mangrove, i.e. grows in soft mud. It has a horizontal trunk that grows beneath the ground; only the leaves and flower stalk grow vertically above the surface. From a distance, it looks like a clump of coconut fronds growing straight out of the water or the mud.

Its fronds are used for matting ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 66) and for roofing, but it is not nearly as durable as sago thatch ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)).

Final POc _&ast;-q_ of _&ast;nipaq_ is attested by the presence of paragogic _-i_ in Saliba, which occurs only after a present or earlier word-final consonant.

<a id="p-183"></a>


<a id="s-4-6"></a>

### 4.6. _Xylocarpus_ spp. (syn. _Xylocarpus obovatus_, _Carapa obovata_), puzzlenut tree (Meliaceae)


<a id="fig-3-6_6"> </a>

[__Figure 6.6:__ _Xylocarpus granatum_, puzzlenut tree: leaves flowers and fruit.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-6_6)



_Xylocarpus granatum_ and _Xylocarpus moluccensis_ are foreshore trees or shrubs, with a trunk 3-15 metres tall and up to 70cm in diameter. The wood is reddish and the old bark peels off to reveal new, papery bark inside. Both are widespread between mangrove stands and near the beach. _Xylocarpus granatum_ has smaller fruit than _Xylocarpus moluccensis_, which has a large red fruit with flesh surrounding a seed which is triangular-pyramidal in shape and 5-8cm across. The fruit of _Xylocarpus moluccensis_ hangs heavily and is larger than the fruits of other trees, earning the tree the name 'testicles tree' in Kwara'ae (_faʔi lalato_; [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 122) and in Uripiv (_n-ai laslas_; J. Lynch, pers. comm.).[^5] The fruit is divided into four quadrants, each containing 3-5 irregular woody seeds ([Johns 1976](Source#cldf:Johns1976): 206). The: seeds are used by children as a puzzle, the goal of which is to put the fallen seeds together as a ball ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 285). Hence the English label 'puzzlenut'.

POc _&ast;tapi(l)_ is problematic because only the Muyuw reflex has a secure gloss, and because Gela _tavili_ - if it is cognate - reflects a POc final consonant and a paragogic _-i_, suggesting that it is a loan from a nearby NW Solomonic language. The only secure reconstruction is PCP _&ast;legi-legi_ 'puzzlenut tree, _Xylocarpus granatum_'.

## Notes

[^1]: It is not clear whether Milke intends East Uvean or West Uvean.

[^2]: Marovo normally reflects POc _&ast;-q_ as _-k-_, followed by an echo vowel, but if this is the directly possessed (suffixed) noun 'sap', then loss of root-final _&ast;-q_ is regular.

[^3]: Cf Gela _sososo_ 'sap, juice', Arosi _toto_ 'sap'.

[^4]: Cf Vitu (MM) _toto_ 'milk', Mota (NCV) _totoa-_ 'juice of tree, thick fluid in bark', Raga (NCV) _toto_ 'sap' , Nguna (NCV) _totoa_ 'sap, exude sap' (NCV items from [Clark 1996](Source#cldf:Clark1996)), PPn _&ast;toto_ 'blood, sap' (POLLEX).

[^5]: These items may reflect a PEOc etymon with a form something like _&ast;kayu ni laso-laso_, but it is also possible that the Kwara'ae and Uripiv terms are independent coinages.

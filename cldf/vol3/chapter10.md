## 1. Introduction


Green vegetables form an important part of _&ast;tamaji_ ([ch.2, §6.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-2#cldf:3-2)), the ingredients of a meal which accompany _&ast;kanaŋ_, starchy food ([ch.2, §6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-1#cldf:3-2)). [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 83) point out that there is often no meat or fish component in the accompanying ingredients in the Solomons, and that these often consist only of green vegetables, which are a major source of protein. This explains the popularity of the high-protein _Abelmoschus manihot_. Solomon Islanders consume a diverse range of green vegetables, some cultivated, some collected from the wild, and the same is true in the Bismarcks.

Probably the most widely cultivated leafy vegetables in the Bismarck Archipelago are _Abelmoschus manihot_ ([§2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1#cldf:3-10)) and various species of _Amaranthus_ ([§2.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2#cldf:3-10)). However, all the latter except _Amaranthus tricolor_ are introduced plants (R.M. Bourke, pers. comm.) and were most probably not present in the gardens of Proto Oceanic speakers. Young leaves and petioles of _Colocasia esculenta_ taro ([ch.9, §2.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-2-1#cldf:3-9)) are also commonly eaten as vegetables, and many languages have a separate word for them ([ch.4, §2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-5#cldf:3-4)).

Ferns recorded as being eaten include species of _Asplenium_, _Athyrium_, _Ctenitis_, _Cyathea_ ([§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-10)), _Dennstaedtia_, Diplazium and _Dryopteris_, as well as _Cyclosorus truncatus_ ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 125). _Diplazium esculentum_ is noted by [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 84) as the most widely eaten fern in the Solomons. However, the only fern for which a POc term is reconstructed here is _Cyathea_ ([§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:3-10)).

An important seasonal food in some areas is the inflorescence (the unopened flower) of _Saccharum edule_ ([§3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-2#cldf:3-10)). Another edible grass, Setaria palmifolia (no reconstruction), is an important vegetable in inland areas of the Bismarcks and New Guinea (M. Bourke, pers. comm.). The stinging herb _Laportea_ interrupta (syn. Fleurya interrupta, Urtica interrupta) is cultivated and eaten by the Tolai of the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain ([ch.7, §6.3 .2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3-2#cldf:3-7)). The leaves of _Morinda citrifolia_ are also eaten as a green vegetable in parts of Papua New Guinea ([ch.13, §3.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-4#cldf:3-13)). Despite the large number of species that serve as green vegetables, however, only a few terms for them have been reconstructed.

Trees of the genus _Ficus_ ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:3-10)) are included here because leaves of some freestanding species serve as green vegetables in NW Island Melanesia. This is not true of all _Ficus_ species in the region, but it is convenient to keep all species of the genus together, as there are difficulties in tying the glosses of some reconstructions down to particular species.

## 2. Leafy vegetables



<a id="s-2-1"></a>

### 2.1. _Abelmoschus manihot_ (syn. _Hibiscus manihot_), slippety cabbage, bush cabbage, island cabbage, TP _aibika_, P _slipari kabis_, B _kabis aelan_ (Malvaceae)


<a id="fig-3-10_1"> </a>

[__Figure 10.1:__ _Abelmoschus manihot_: __A__, plant (height 1.5 m); __B__, stem with leaf (edible) and flower bud; __C__, flower; __D__, varieties displayed to show the diversity in leaf shape.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-10_1)



_Abelmoschus manihot_ is a low, many-branched tree-like shrub, seemingly present in every garden throughout the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons ([Figure 10.1](#fig-3-10_1)). [Barrau](Source#cldf:Barrau1955) ([1955](Source#cldf:Barrau1955): 77) calls it 'truly the traditional vegetable of the whole of Melanesia'. Cuttings are planted in mixed crop gardens and are also harvested from young regrowth in abandoned gardens. There are many varieties, the young shoots and leaves of which have a high protein-to-calorie ratio and are cooked in stone ovens, boiled or steamed in bamboo containers or roasted in bark ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 131).

POc _&ast;wasa_ primarily denoted _Abelmoschus manihot_, evidently the most salient and commonly consumed green vegetable in Lapita communities, but it also appears to have been used hypernymously for 'green vegetables' in general, to judge from the glosses below.

[POc &ast;_wasa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-2-1-294-POc-wasa-a)


<a id="p-295"></a>

[French-Wright](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:FrenchWright1983): 162) also reconstructs a term POc _&ast;bele_ which apparently denoted _Abelmoschus manihot_ alone. [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Geraghty2004): 85) suspects that the Polynesian terms are borrowed from Fijian, since Fijian _bele_ can be glossed as 'soft leaf'. If, however, the Gedaged, Sye and Ura terms are cognate, this observation is not relevant.

[POc &ast;_bele_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-2-1-295-POc-bele-a)

Two terms for _Abelmoschus manihot_ can be reconstructed in lower interstage languages.

[PNCV &ast;_vera_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-2-1-295-PNCV-vera-a)


<a id="p-296"></a>

The meaning of the etymon reconstructed below is not clear. It may have been another generic for green vegetables in general or denoted a kind of green vegetable. On the evidence of Lau alone, may have been _Abelmoschus manihot_. It was probably not _Amaranthus viridis_, as this appears to have been unknown to POc speakers.

<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. _Amaranthus tricolor_ (syn. _Amaranthus gangeticus_, _Amaranthus oleraceus_), Chinese spinach, Joseph's coat amaranth, TP _aupa_ (Amaranthaceae)


_Amaranthus tricolor_ is described by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 166--168) as an erect plant 0.6--1.2 m tall, with many long leaves growing directly from the stem and no or almost no terminal flower cluster. Varieties with the multicoloured leaves to which tricolor refers are decorative plants in gardens in western countries, but the varieties grown as a green vegetable in gardens in India, China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomons usually have green leaves.

A number of _Amaranthus_ species are grown in New Guinea and the Bismarcks today, but probably only _Amaranthus tricolor_, an ancient introduction from SE Asia, was present traditionally.[^1] Others, mostly Central and South American domesticates, have been introduced by Europeans since 1870 ([Bourke forthcoming](Source#cldf:Bourkeforthcoming), [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)).

<a id="fig-3-10_2"> </a>

[__Figure 10.2:__ Aramanthus tricolor, Chinese spinach](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-10_2)



_Amaranthus tricolor_ is grown from seed in mixed gardens and gathered whole after 1-2 months growth. Some plants are left to go to seed, and the seeds stored for planting. The spinach-like leaves are, like _Abelmoschus manihot_, cooked in stone ovens, boiled or steamed in bamboo containers or roasted in bark ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124-125).


<a id="p-297"></a>

The only reconstruction is at the level of PNCV:

<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. _Gnetum gnemon_, TP _tulip_ (Gnetaceae)


_Gnetum gnemon_ is a small tree found in lowland forests in the Bismarcks, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Fiji, growing to between 8 and 15 m in height. Leaf stalks grow directly from the branch in pairs: hence its Tok Pisin name, _tulip_ 'two-leaf' ([Figure 10.3](#fig-3-10_3)). The young leaves and shoots are widely cooked and eaten as a vegetable. It has red or orange fruit, the seeds and mesocarp of which are roasted and eaten in some areas ([Paijmans 1976](Source#cldf:Paijmansetal1976): 124, [Evans 1999](Source#cldf:Evans1999): 19-21, [Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 139): Evans singles out the islands of the Temotu Province of the Solomons for special mention. In the wild it grows along rivers and streams, but not near the beach, as it appears to dislike salt spray ([Manner & Elevitch 2006a](Source#cldf:MannerandElevitch2006a)). [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 37) describes it as a 'cultivated tree' and [Kennedy & Clarke](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:KennedyandClarke2004)) mention it in their list of species that are subject to arboriculture.

<a id="fig-3-10_3"> </a>

[__Figure 10.3:__ _Gnetum gnemon_: __A__, tree; __B__, fruiting branch with edible young leaves and fruit; __C__, mature edible fruit; __D__, flowering branch with edible flower.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-10_3)



On New Britain and Manus and in the Siassi Islands the bark fibre of _Gnetum gnemon_ is reported as being used to make ropes and string ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954), [O'Collins & Lamothe 1989](Source#cldf:OCollinsandLamothe1989), [Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen 2007](Source#cldf:BugenhagenandBugenhagen2007)). On Manus the bark is also used as a wrapping material.

POc _&ast;kusaq_ 'k.o. edible greens' may have denoted _Gnetum gnemon_, but more widespread reflexes are needed before we can be sure of this. Like the other terms for green vegetables reconstructed in this chapter, reflexes refer to more than one kind of green vegetable.

Misima _kusai_ provides evidence for the final _&ast;-q_ of POc _&ast;kusaq_. Misima has borrowed much of its vocabulary from Suauic dialects: these add paragogic _-i_ after a final consonant, and _-i_ here points to the earlier presence of _&ast;-q_.

### 2.4. _Polyscias_ spp., panax, B _nalaslas_ (Araliaceae)


_Polyscias_ species are erect thin shrubs between one and 5 m in height found at least as far east as Fiji. They grow wild in shady environments and have green foliage which is eaten as a green vegetable in New Guinea, the Bismarcks, the Solomons and Vanuatu. In NW Island Melanesia they are often planted (from cuttings) as hedges, but when they are cultivated in sunlight, their appearance changes, as the foliage turns pale green or yellow and cultivated shrubs are often pruned to obtain a thick bushy form. [French](Source#cldf:French1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:French1986): 74) names five species growing in Papua New Guinea, namely _Polyscias cumingiana_, _Polyscias scutellaria_, _Polyscias fruticosa_, _Polyscias macgillivrayi_ and _Polyscias verticillata_, and [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 111-112) list all except the first for the Solomons ([Figure 10.4](#fig-3-10_4)). They comment that the greens have 'a pleasant mild "curry" taste'.

<a id="fig-3-10_4"> </a>

[__Figure 10.4:__ _Polyscias_ species: __A__, _Polyscias scutellaria_, young shoot with small portion of inflorescence; __B__, terminal portion of inflorescence; __C__, _Polyscias verticillata_: flowering shoot and leaf; __D__, _Polyscias fruticosa_: leaflet; __E__ and __F__, leaflets of two other _Polyscias_ species.](MediaTable#cldf:fig-3-10_4)




<a id="p-299"></a>

[Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 421-422) describes the first three. _Polyscias cumingiana_ (syn. _Polyscias pinnata_, _Polyscias rumphiana_) and _Polyscias scutellaria_ (syn. _Nothopanax scutellarium_, _Crassula scutellaria_) are tree-like shrubs respectively 2-5m and 3-6m in height, the leaves of which are used for packing fish for cooking and as a green vegetable. [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding2005) ([2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 122) notes that in Marovo the large green and yellow leaves of _Polyscias cumingiana_ are used as ingredient in stews. _Polyscias fruticosa_ (syn. _Panax fruticosum_, _Nothopanax fruticosum_ ), is a smaller shrub, 0.8-3 m high, with smaller leaves. According to [Gardner & Pawley](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006) ([2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)), on Waya juice extracted from the leaves of _Polyscias_ was dropped into the nostrils as a cure for earache or headache.

No POc term is unambiguously reconstructable, but it is possible that the reflexes below of PSOc _&ast;(la)lawis_ '_Polyscias_ sp.' may be cognate with Muyuw (PT) _(a)lawiluw_ ([Damon 2004](Source#cldf:Damon2004)) and Lau (SES) _lausi_, both denoting '_Celtis nymanii_', a small tree used in housebuilding and firewood, the leaves of which provide a cure for rheumatism ([Fox 1974](Source#cldf:Fox1974), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 157-158). If so, then POc _&ast;lawis_, gloss unknown (a tree-like shub or small tree species), would be reconstructable. Lau _lausi_ presents a problem, however, as it reflects a form _&ast;lawisi_ with final _&ast;-s_ and echo vowel _&ast;-i_: this is a canonic NW Solomonic form, and we are forced to postulate borrowing into Lau, where such borrowings do not usually occur.

[PSOc &ast;_(la)lawis_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-2-4-299-PSOc-lalawis-a)

[PNCV &ast;_bei_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-2-4-299-PNCV-bei-a)

The items reflecting PNCV _&ast;lalaso_ '_Polyscias scutellaria_' (?) below appear to be cognate with Lau, Kwara'ae (SES) _lalato_ '_Xylocarpus granatum_' ([ch.6, §4.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-6#cldf:3-6)). However, they are not cognate in the strict sense. Each set of items reflects an independent innovation entailing reduplication of a reflex of POc _&ast;lasoR_ 'testicles'. In the case of _Xylocarpus granatum_ the comparison is with rounded fruit that hang heavily ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](Source#cldf:KwaioloaandBurt2001): 122). Explaining PNCV _&ast;lalaso_ is more problematic. [Lynch](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Lynch2004a)) glosses the reconstruction '_Polyscias_ scutellaria' on the basis of the gloss of its reflexes in Paamese, Lewo, Apma, Nguna and S Efate. However, its denotation in Mota seems to be the aerial yam, _Dioscorea bulbifera_ ([ch.9, §2.1.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-1-3#cldf:3-9)), and it is easy to infer a perceived resemblance between testicles and tubers on the vine. If this inference is correct, then _Dioscorea bulbifera_ may have been the PNCV sense of _&ast;lalaso_, rather than _Polyscias scutellaria_.

## 3. Other green vegetables



<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. _Cyathea_ spp., B blakpam (Cyatheaceae)


Among the many ferns eaten in Melanesia, there is just one tree-fern genus for which a putative POc term has been reconstructed. This is PROc _&ast;(b,bʷ)ala_ '_Cyathea_'. POc _&ast;(b,bʷ)ala_ is also reconstructed below, but only one cognate has been found outside Remote Oceania: Kove _va-vala_ 'cycad'. This means that we can be reasonably certain that POc _&ast;(b,bʷ)ala_ denoted a tree fern, but we as yet have no way of knowing for certain whether this was a _Cycas_ or a _Cyathea_. The most widespread tree-fern in the Bismarcks _Cyathea_ contaminans (syn. Alsophila latebrosa), with a stem 5-8 m tall ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 9), is a good candidate for the denotation of _&ast;(b,bʷ)ala_, but a better distributed cognate set is needed in order to confirm this. The Nakanai of New Britain ate the fronds of _Cyathea_ spp. and used the trunks to make fishing spears ([Floyd 1954](Source#cldf:Floyd1954)). On Waya Island (western Fiji) the sap of the young parts of this tree-fern was applied externally to cure headaches, and the scales were used to stuff pillows. The pith of the trunk was eaten as famine food ([Gardner & Pawley 2006](Source#cldf:GardnerandPawley2006)).

<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. _Saccharum edule_, 'coastalpitpit' (in Papua New Guinea), TP, P _pitpit_, B _naviso_ (Poaceae)


_Saccharum edule_ is a tall grass related to sugarcane (_Saccharum officinarum_). [Henderson & Hancock](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 101) write, 'It grows in a variety of locations, but seems best adapted to low altitude, where it can form quite dense stands sometimes attaining heights of four metres or more.' It is cultivated for the unopened inflorescence (flower) at the tip of the cane, harvested as an important seasonal vegetable which is either roasted in its leafy sheath or cooked in coconut cream with other vegetables ([Figure 10.5](#fig-3-10_5)).

_Saccharum edule_ was apparently domesticated long ago, and its several varieties are propagated only by cultivation ([Barrau 1962](Source#cldf:Barrau1962): 157-158). It is grown from cuttings consisting of three or four nodes of the cane, i.e. 30--40 em long, and usually grows in clumps up to two or three metres in height. In Papua New Guinea it is cultivated in gardens up to an altitude of 1800 m. It is also grown in the Solomons, Vanuatu and Fiji.

It is possible that Far East Manggarai, Kepo, Waerana, Razong, Rembong (all CMP) _tebor_ 'Saccharum sp.' ([Verheijen 1990](Source#cldf:Verheijen1990): 240) are cognate with the items below. If it is, then PCEMP _&ast;tabuqaR_ is reconstructable and the reconstruction below is elevated to POc.

<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. _Ficus_ spp., banyans, figs (Moraceae)



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Terms for classes of _Ficus_


Worldwide there are about a thousand species of _Ficus_, including the common fig, _F. carica_. Over 500 species occur in the Asia-Pacific region. Many of them have a limited distribution. _Ficus granatum_, for example, is limited to Vanuatu, _Ficus scabra_ to Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 164, 166). As a consequence, it is difficult to gloss reconstructed terms with their species, as the same term was apparently applied to similar species at different locations. The one distinction that is more easily made is between independently growing species and stranglers.

Independently growing _Ficus_ species are usually of medium size, up to about 15 m tall, and often have edible leaves. Strangler figs, however, sometimes grow to 40 m and form part of the forest canopy. A strangler starts its life as an epiphyte high in a tree where a tiny sticky seed has been deposited in animal droppings. The new seedling grows slowly at first, getting nutrients from leaf litter. It sends out thin roots that snake down the trunk of the host tree or dangle as aerial roots from its branches. When the roots reach the ground they dig in and grow aggressively, competing with the host tree for water and nutrients. The roots form a network that encircles the host and fuses together. As the roots grow thicker they squeeze the host's trunk, cutting off its nutrient supply. In the canopy the strangler's leaves grow more densely than the host's, depriving it of sunlight. Eventually the host dies from strangulation, insufficient sunlight and root competition, and the strangler fig stands on its own. If the host rots away, a hollow centre remains.

A salient feature of the genus _Ficus_ is its figs, which technically are not fruits. A fig is a 'false fruit' or multiple fruit, in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. What is commonly called the 'fruit' of a fig is a syconium, an almost closed receptacle with many small male and female flowers arranged on the inner surface. Technically, the fruit of a fig is one of the many seed-bearing flowers inside the syconium. The syconium typically has a bulbous shape with a small opening at the distal end that gives access to tiny wasps (Agaoninae spp.) that pollinate the flowers in the process of laying their eggs within the syconium, thus enjoying a symbiotic relationship with the fig tree.

The literature reports numerous instances of the bark, the latex or the leaves of one or other _Ficus_ species being used for medicinal purposes. On Vanua Lava (Banks Islands, Vanuatu) latex from _Artocarpus altilis_ and _Ficus adenosperma_ is mixed as a potion against excessive menstrual discharge ([Bourdy & Walter 1994](Source#cldf:BourdyandWalter1994)). On Chuuk the bark of _Ficus_ prolixa is used as medicine against evil spirits, its fruits and leaves used as medicine, and its roots are used to flavor a special breadfruit pudding ([Goodenough & Sugita 1980](Source#cldf:GoodenoughandSugita1980)). On Lihir the leaves are heated and rubbed on painful joints, bones, muscles. They can also be used to heal sickness after eating the wrong kind of fish. They also have ritual power, and are used to make parcels containing several other types of medicinal leaves (S. [Foale 2001](Source#cldf:Foale2001)).

The inner bark of _Ficus_ species is used in New Britain for male garments, and old pieces of these are used to bind the heads of children in order to elongate the skull, and for wrapping food for cooking in a stone oven ([Arentz et al. 1989](Source#cldf:Arentzetal1989): 94, A. Chowning, pers. comm.). However, [Mahdi](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999)) shows that strangler figs have sacred and ceremonial significance across much of the Austronesian speaking region, including in Oceania at least southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia.


<a id="p-303"></a>

Three POc terms for apparently superordinate _Ficus_ taxa are reconstructable: _&ast;nunuk_, _&ast;qayawan_ and _&ast;ba[k,g]a_.

POc _&ast;nunuk_ denoted either a taxon including all _Ficus_ species known to POc speakers or a taxon including just small freestanding species; it is unclear which. The fact that Peekel does not give Tolai _nunu_ as the name for any of the 16 species for which he provides vernacular names implies that it is a generic term for all _Ficus_. On the other hand, the fact that the more carefully specified glosses other than Lou denote small freestanding species (_Ficus aspera_, F. subulata and _Ficus vitiensis_) suggests the latter.

[Mahdi](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999)) suggests either that _&ast;nunuk_ reflects the same root as that in POc _&ast;[qa]nunu_ 'shadow' or that some Oceanic terms for _Ficus_ species reflect _&ast;[qa]nunu_ rather than _&ast;nunuk_, but I see no evidence for either proposal.

[PMP &ast;_nunuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-1-303-POc-nunuk-a)

It is probable that _&ast;qayawan_ denoted a strangler fig taxon. The Gedaged, Kara, Tolai and Patpatar reflexes each denote a taxon of strangler figs: _Ficus benjamina_ ('weeping fig, Java fig, Java willow'), _F. katabibi_ and _F. rebareba_ are described by [Peekel](Source#cldf:Peekel1984) ([1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 139) as stranglers.[^4] The Micronesian and Niuean reflexes denote _Ficus prolixa_, also a strangler. Kara, Tolai and Patpatar are located in New Ireland, i.e. in the Oceanic heartland of the Bismarcks, and I assume that they are likely to retain the original sense of _&ast;qayawan_, whereas _Ficus tinctoria_ (Muyuw, Wayan) and _Ficus pritchardii_ (Wayan), neither of them stranglers, are more likely to reflect shifts in denotation. Whether POc _&ast;qayawan_ denoted a taxon which included all strangler fig species or just a subset, we cannot tell.

[PEMP &ast;_qayawan_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-1-303-POc-qayawan-a)


<a id="p-304"></a>

POc _&ast;qayawan_ also seems to have a second set of reflexes in Micronesia. A putative PMic _&ast;kawani_ '_Ficus_ sp.' can be reconstructed. However, the correspondences here - especially the word-final reflexes of _&ast;n_ - indicate that this is an early borrowing via the Caroline Islands from a western Austronesian language.

POc _&ast;ba[k,g]a_ denoted a taxon of freestanding, medium-sized _Ficus_ species. Denotata of reflexes include _Ficus nodosa_, _Ficus wassa_, _Ficus prolixa_, _Ficus obliqua_, _Ficus mutabilis_ and _Ficus tinctoria_, none of them stranglers. [^6]

The items under 'cf. also' are probably not cognate. Three of them point to a term for a nut tree, a species of either _Canarium_ or _Terminalia_, but data are insufficient to reconstruct this term. [Mahdi](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Mahdi1999)) suggests that this term is cognate with Western Malaya-Polynesian terms reflecting a putative _&ast;pakat_ 'root'.

### 4.2. _Ficus copiosa_ and _Ficus wassa_, sandpaper cabbage, sandpaper fig, TP _kumu musong_ (Moraceae)


[Bourke](Source#cldf:Bourkend) ([n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)) names three lowland indigenous _Ficus_ species in Papua New Guinea that have edible figs: _Ficus copiosa_ (TP _kumu musong_), _Ficus wassa_ and _Ficus tinctoria_. They are small freestanding trees or shrubs and grow both in the highlands and in the lowlands. The three species are self-sown and there is no evidence of cultivation in Papua New Guinea. The figs of the three species are eaten, particularly those of _Ficus copiosa_, which are eaten raw. However, the main food product of these species in Papua New Guinea, and again especially of _Ficus copiosa_, is their young leaves, which are used as a green vegetable (in Papua New Guinea by about one-third of the rural population; [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming)). The Tok Pisin term _kumu musong_ means 'hairy greens'.


<a id="p-307"></a>

_Ficus copiosa_ and _Ficus wassa_ are similar ([Figure 10.6](#fig-3-10_6)). Both rejoice in the name 'sandpaper cabbage' in the Solomons because of their coarse texture (even when cooked). The leaves of _Ficus wassa_ are more abrasive than those of _Ficus copiosa_, and therefore somewhat less popular as food ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 123, 125)

_Ficus copiosa_ (syn. _F. longipedunculata_, _F. acanthrophylla_) has twigs covered in bristles ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 141). It grows widely in New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Solomons. In Marovo _Ficus copiosa_ is traditionally an important leaf vegetable, and young leaves and shoots are either cooked in coconut cream or mixed with crushed smoked _Canarium_ nuts ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005): 138).

_Ficus wassa_ (syn. _F. portus-finschii_, _F. papus_ (Peekel), _F. uauasie_ (Peekel) is a tree 5-20 m tall with twigs that are hairy and pungent and figs that turn red when ripe ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 141). It is found from eastern Indonesia through New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Solomons to Vanuatu ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 168). The leaves of the wild trees are cooked as a vegetable in Papua New Guinea, the Solomons and Vanuatu ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](Source#cldf:HendersonandHancock1988): 125, [Wheatley 1992](Source#cldf:Wheatley1992): 170--172). In Vanuatu green figs are eaten cooked. Figs ripen quickly, and must be eaten immediately. Lactating women regularly eat the leaves, which are said to stimulate milk production ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 168-169).

There is enough agreement among the meanings of reflexes of POc _&ast;iguRa_ to suggest that it had sandpapery leaves and denoted either _Ficus copiosa_ or _Ficus wassa_ or both.

[POc &ast;_iguRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-2-307-POc-igura-a)

POc _&ast;pʷabosi_ is the most likely candidate for a term denoting _Ficus wassa_. All named reflexes denote a small or medium-sized freestanding _Ficus_ sp. The set below, from which I tentatively reconstruct POc _&ast;pʷabosi_, contains some doublets and a number of phonological irregularities, especially in regard to the bilabials. I infer that the two POc bilabials were not identical, but that assimilation has operated to make them so in several reflexes. Doublets are probably the outcomes of local borrowings. An interstage ancestral to Solos, Petats and probably Teop replaced the initial bilabial obstruent with _&ast;u-_.

POc _&ast;qa(l,R)a_ may have been another term for _Ficus copiosa_ ([§4.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2#cldf:3-10)).

### 4.3. _Ficus tinctoria_, dye fig (Moraceae)


_Ficus tinctoria_ is an erect shrub 2-4 m tall with yellow-orange or red edible figs, found on coral rocks and cliffs on the foreshore or inland in coral soil. It is distributed from India and China through SE Asia, New Guinea and right through the islands as far as western Polynesia, but is absent from New Caledonia ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 147, [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 169). Its leaves are a green vegetable in Papua New Guinea ([Bourke n.d.](Source#cldf:Bourkend)).

POc _&ast;taŋa_ appears to have denoted _Ficus tinctoria_. This is its meaning in New Ireland. In southern Vanuatu it denotes _Ficus granatum_, another medium-sized freestanding species with edible figs, limited in its distribution to Vanuatu ([Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 163-164).

POc _&ast;(c,j)api_ appears to have denoted a species with edible leaves, possibly _Ficus tinctoria_.

### 4.4. Other names for _Ficus_ species


The reconstructions below denote _Ficus_ species, but it is not usually certain which one(s).

It is possible that POc _&ast;seRa_ denoted _Ficus adenosperma_, a freestanding tree 5-15 m tall with green or yellow figs that are eaten in times of food shortage in some communities ([Peekel 1984](Source#cldf:Peekel1984): 147; [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 169).

[POc &ast;_seRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-4-309-POc-sera-a)

POc _&ast;bauRa_ may have denoted a species of strangler fig.

[POc &ast;_bauRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-4-309-POc-baura-a)

The glosses give no real clue to the denotatum of POc _&ast;ka(mʷa)-kamʷa_, other than that it was perhaps a freestanding species.

[POc &ast;_ka(mʷa)-kamʷa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:3-10-4-4-309-POc-kamakama-a)

The gloss of PNCV _&ast;buliva_ is clearly _Ficus_ scabra (a species found only in central and souther Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and western Polynesia; [Walter & Sam 2002](Source#cldf:WalterandSam2002): 166), but the denotation of PEOc _&ast;bulipa_ remains unclear.

## Notes

[^1]: The antiquity in New Guinea of A. dubius, also of SE Asian origin, is unknown; [Bourke & Allen forthcoming](Source#cldf:BourkeandAllenforthcoming).

[^2]: In her publications Chowning cites the alternant _tavuahi_.

[^3]: Walter and Sam gloss this as '_Ficus adenosperma_' in their appendix of vernacular names. This seems to be an editorial error, as _Ficus aspera_ is the species described in the body of the book (161- 162).

[^4]: _F. katabibi_ and _F. rebareba_ are Peekel's temporary names: I have found them nowhere else in the literature.

[^5]: [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Benderetal1983)) use the gloss _F. carolinensis_, but [Defilipps et al.](Source#cldf:Defilippsetal1988) ([1988](Source#cldf:Defilippsetal1988)) list this as a variety of _Ficus prolixa_.

[^6]: _Ficus obliqua_ may be freestanding or a strangler. _Ficus bengalensis_ (if it is correctly identified), is a recent introduction.

[^7]: One of these forms, probably papus, is presumably a borrowing.

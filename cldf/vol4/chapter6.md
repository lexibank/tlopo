## 1. Introduction


There may not have been a domain of the Proto Oceanic lexicon corresponding precisely to the Class Aves. The creatures referred to by reflexes of POc _&ast;manuk_ (below) almost always include bats and sometimes other flying animals. For example, Kwaio _laŋasi_ (a taboo replacement for _manu_) ‘in the broadest categorical sense, includes birds, butterflies, moths, bats, dragonflies and one species of frogs (_Pseudophryne_ sp.)’ ([Keesing 1975](Source#cldf:Keesing1975):119). At its widest _&ast;manuk_ may have encompassed the entire non-aquatic animal kingdom (for discussion see chapter 8, §[§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:4-6) and 6). More restrictive expressions are often coined by adding a modifier to _&ast;manuk_, typically the verb ‘to fly’, for example Chuukese _māɾ_ ‘living creature of land or air (other than human)’, _mac̣c̣aŋ_ ‘bird’ (cf. _c̣aŋ_ ‘fly’). The organisation of this book, however, follows the Linnaean classification, and bats will be found in chapter 5, with only a couple of cross-references below to connect the two.

Birds played varied roles in the life of Oceanic speakers. Besides the domesticated fowl (_Gallus gallus_), some types of birds (including frigate birds and parrots) were caught and kept as pets. Others were prized as food (pigeons and doves, some seabirds). The large eggs of the megapode were gathered for food. The feathers of many species had decorative uses, and their bones were used for a range of artefacts from needles to flutes. Birds could be caught with snares, nets or traps of various kinds, or shot with bow and arrow. (Special blunt-tipped arrows avoided damage to valued feathers.) Apart from direct exploitation, some birds could be sources of useful information, such as flocks of terns indicating the location of schools of fish, or landbirds far out at sea, indicating the presence of land nearby. Some, on the other hand, were harmful, such as the raptors that preyed on domestic fowl, or the swamp-hen with its destructive effects on taro gardens.

A widespread belief was that the voices of certain species could foretell such events as a death or the arrival of visitors. In eastern Polynesia, the visitors themselves were referred to as ‘birds’ (PCEPn _&ast;manu-firi_ ‘chosen (?) birds’). And in myth, folk tale and religious belief, birds play almost as varied a range of roles as do humans. Among the Dobuans, ‘the native term for totem is the term for bird … [and] one stranger may ask another, “what is your bird?”’ ([Fortune 1963](Source#cldf:Fortune1963):32).

## 2. The life and parts of birds


A few aspects of avian anatomy and behaviour are different enough from their human (or mammalian) analogues that they might be expected to be separately lexicalised. In most cases, however, POc appears to have found commonalities with more general anatomical features of the animal kingdom.

Perhaps the most emblematic features of birds are feathers and wings. But the most general term for feathers is the same as that for human body hair and animal fur:

[PMP &ast;_bulu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-273-POc-pulu-a)


<a id="p-274"></a>

A second set with this meaning is connected with PMP _&ast;ibut_ ‘pull, uproot’ (Blust 1995):

[POc &ast;_ipu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-274-POc-ipu-a)

Both of the above refer to the overall covering of birds that is analogous to the hair covering of mammals. Feathers particularly conspicuous by length or colour have probably always been of special interest and valued as decoration. A term for such feathers is reconstructed for PMP, but its unambiguous Oceanic reflexes are restricted in scope:

[PMP &ast;_lawi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-274-POc-lawe-a)

A number of forms suggested a variant reconstruction _&ast;la-lau_[^1]

[4-6-2-None-274-nng-manam-lalau](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-274-nng-manam-lalau)


<a id="p-275"></a>

A distinct lexical item POc _&ast;banic_ ‘wing, arm, hand, fin (probably pectoral)’ is widely attested. Its PMP ancestor _&ast;panij_ denoted only wings, but its meaning had clearly been extended in POc (see chapter 2 for a fuller cognate set and discussion).

[PMP &ast;_panij_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-275-POc-banic-a)

[Dempwolff](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938) ([1938](Source#cldf:Dempwolff1938)) reconstructs PMP _&ast;kapak_ ‘wings; flutter’ on the basis of Oceanic data and Malay _kepak_, Ngaju Dayak _kapak_. This etymon appears to be reflected by the widespread etymon POc _&ast;kaba_ (N) ‘wing’, (v) ‘flap wings’.

[PMP &ast;_kapak_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-275-POc-kaba-a)


<a id="p-276"></a>

Derived from PPn _&ast;kapa_ is PPn _&ast;kapa-kau_ ‘wing, fin’:

[PPn &ast;_kapa-kau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-276-PPn-kapakau-a)

Blust (ACD) also reconstructs PWMP _&ast;kepek_ ‘flap wings’ (expected POc form †_&ast;kopo(k)_) and PWMP _&ast;kepay-kepay_ ‘flap (wings, fins of fish, etc.)’ (expected POc form †_&ast;kope_) with supporting data, and crossreferences the doublets _&ast;kapay_ and _&ast;kipay_ (without supporting data) (expected POc forms †_&ast;kape_ and †_&ast;kipe_). PMP _&ast;kapay_ is perhaps reflected by Tawala _apape_ ‘wing’. I find no straightforward reflexes of Blust’s other reconstructions, but Iduna (PT) _ofa-na_ ‘(its) wing’ and Gela (SES) _gapo-gapo_ ‘spread wings, flap, flutter’ suggest that there were perhaps several phonologically similar forms in POc cognate with the forms found in Western Malayo-Polynesian languages.


<a id="p-277"></a>

A bird’s beak was most probably referred to as POc _&ast;ŋuju_, denoting the external or protruding aspect of the mouth. There is also some evidence for POc _&ast;muju_, in the form of non-Oceanic terms from which Blust (ACD) reconstructs PWMP _&ast;mu(n)cuŋ_ ‘mouth (of an animal), snout’,[^2] together with the Iduna, Gapapaiwa and Balawaia terms listed below, reflecting PPT _&ast;mu(d,j)u_. However, it may be that this is a chance similarity and that PPT _&ast;muju_ was an irregular reflex of POc _&ast;ŋuju_.[^3]

[POc &ast;_ŋuju_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-277-POc-uju-a)

Many, perhaps most Oceanic languages make some lexical distinctions among the tails of birds, fish, reptiles and mammals. The following very common term for tail appears applicable to birds in many languages:

[PAn &ast;_ikuR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-277-POc-ikur-a)


<a id="p-278"></a>

Finally, the feet of most bird species are likened to animal claws and fingernails:

[PMP &ast;_kuSkuS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-278-POc-kuku-a)

Other anatomical features such as the cock’s comb and spurs are lexicalised diversely and there is no clear POc reconstruction.

The laying of relatively large (and often edible) eggs is distinctive of birds (along with turtles and other reptiles). A well established reconstruction is:

[PMP &ast;_qateluR_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-278-POc-qatolur-a)


<a id="p-279"></a>

A word of more general reference, POc _&ast;puaq_, originally ‘fruit’, but generalised as a classifier for a wide range of more or less spherical objects, is sometimes used for eggs, but this may well be the result of repeated local extensions.

[4-6-2-None-279-nng-gitua-pua](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-279-nng-gitua-pua)

Despite the great variety in the form and construction of birds’ nests (note PMic _&ast;fata_ ‘platform, nest’ from POc _&ast;patar_ ‘platform’, [vol.1,57](ContributionTable?anchor=p-57#cldf:1-3) and p. 190), a common term can be reconstructed (sometimes stated as also applying to nests or dens of animals).

[PEMP &ast;_niku(i)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-279-POc-nnikunuki-a)


<a id="p-280"></a>

A PCP form is also reconstructable:

[PCP &ast;_ova_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-280-PCP-ova-a)

The actions surrounding eggs and nests are less distinctively lexicalised. The verb corresponding to ‘lay’ is etymologically various (e.g. Lau _kʷala_ ‘give birth, beget, lay an egg’, Bauan _vaka-lutu_ ‘drop, lay (egg)’, Paamese _mūmoni_ ‘make’ _mūmon orelīte_ ‘lay an egg’), but note the following:

[POc &ast;_tau(p)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-280-POc-taup-a)

The action of incubating eggs by sitting on them is compared with that of covering and protecting the young in the following verb attributable to PEOc:

[PEOc &ast;_ovi(s)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-280-PEOc-ovis-a)

When the egg hatches, the words used are generally those for the breaking open of rigid containers (the coconut probably being the most familiar comparison), but no consistent etymon emerges.

The action of flying is as emblematic of birds as their possession of feathers and wings, and several verbs are associated with it (see also POc _&ast;kaba_ ‘(n) wing, (v) flap wings’ above):


<a id="p-281"></a>

[PMP &ast;_Rebek_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-281-POc-ropok-a)

POc _&ast;tap(p,pʷ)a_ may perhaps have referred to gliding or soaring; the apparently contradictory meaning of ‘flap wings’ in some languages may represent contamination from POc _&ast;kaba_ ‘flap wings’ (above).

[POc &ast;_ta(p,pʷ)a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-2-None-281-POc-tappa-a)

## 3. Bird names


There is a strong consensus among recent researchers locating the Proto Oceanic homeland in Northwest Melanesia, with the island of New Britain a focus of probabilities. I will follow this view insofar as it helps give a perspective on the dimensions of the problem of reconstructing this particular lexical field. In what follows I will use the term ‘homeland’ to refer to New Britain and its neighbouring islands. The birds among which referents for POc reconstructions will be sought in this study are those which are residents of or regular visitors to the Bismarck Archipelago, as described in recent handbooks ([Coates 1985](Source#cldf:Coates1985), [1990](Source#cldf:Coates1990); [Coates & Peckover 2001](Source#cldf:CoatesandPeckover2001)). This gives a total of slightly more than 200 species belonging to 126 genera, 77 of them monotypic.

The reconstructions presented below do not comprise all or even most of a plausible avian terminology of Proto Oceanic. Entire families of birds which were almost certainly known to the POc speakers are unrepresented here, because the small number of terms so far recorded for living Oceanic languages do not yield up any useful cognate sets. Examples are the grebes (Podicipedidae), pelicans (Pelecanidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), ibises (Threskiornithidae), nightjars (Caprimulgidae), flowerpeckers (Dicaeidae), waxbills (Estrildidae) and drongos (Dicruridae). This lack, in turn, is primarily a result of the insufficiency of the data, particularly for languages of Northwest Melanesia, where the avifauna is the richest. The situation has improved, but only slightly, since my previous study ([Clark 1994b](Source#cldf:Clark1994b)). There is still an almost complete lack of really comprehensive studies.

It may be useful, nevertheless, to have some idea of what such a taxonomy would have looked like. In my earlier paper I reasoned by analogy from two detailed studies from societies close to the Oceanic region, though both non-Austronesian in language: [Majnep & Bulmer](Source#cldf:MajnepandBulmer1977) ([1977](Source#cldf:MajnepandBulmer1977)) on Kalam of the New Guinea highlands, and [Taylor](Source#cldf:Taylor1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Taylor1990)) on Tobelo of north Halmahera. Both studies found a total of about 200 lexemes for avian taxa. The typical taxon corresponds to a Linnaean genus, though as a substantial proportion of genera were monotypic (represented by a single species) within the area studied, there is a certain ambiguity between genus and species. Genus-level taxon labels in Kalam, for instance, would include _ccp_ covering the Australian Goshawk (_Accipiter fasciatus_) and Black-mantled Goshawk (_Accipiter melanochlamys_), _kwwt_ for both the Amboina Cuckoo dove (_Macropygia_ amboinensis) and the Black-billed Cuckoo dove (_Macropygia nigrirostris_), _mmañp_ labelling both the Glossy Swiftlet (_Collocalia esculenta_) and the Mountain Swiftlet (_Collocalia hirundinacea_), _plolom_ both the Mountain Yellow-billed Kingfisher (_Halcyon megarhyncha_) and the Sacred Kingfisher (H. sanclay and _walkobneŋ_ both the Black-fronted White-eye (_Zosterops minor_) and the Mountain Whiteeye (_Zosterops novaeguineae_). In some cases, conventional distinguishing expressions exist to discriminate between the two species, for example, _ccp mseŋ-ket_ ‘Australian Goshawk’ (_mseŋ-ket_ ‘open country’) versus _ccp kamay-ket_ ‘Black-mantled Goshawk’ (_kamay-ket_ ‘beech tree sp.’).


<a id="p-283"></a>

On the other hand, some Kalam taxa correspond to Linnaean groups larger than the genus, and some cut across the terminology altogether, recognizing convergent similarities: _spsep_ refers both to the Mountain Pygmy Parrot (Micropsitta bruijni) and the Pink-faced Nuthatch (_Daphoenositta miranda_). _sskl_ refers to both Whitehead’s Swiftlet (_Collocalia whiteheadi_) and the Pacific Swallow (_Hirundo tahitica_). (Cf. POc _&ast;kabakabal_ in [§5.12](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-12#cldf:4-6).)

Most birds produce some sound audible to humans, whether territorial song, flocking calls or alarm cries, and often this is distinctive enough to be recognised as emblematic of the bird itself. The transcoding of bird vocalizations into human speech sounds is a universal phenomenon, and birds are probably onomatopoetically named more than any other class of living things. In theory this can pose an obstacle to the comparative method, if the independent application of an onomatopoetic name to the same bird in different languages produces pseudo-cognates. However, the more remotely related the two languages, the less likely such pairs of names are to follow regular sound correspondences. The approach taken here will be to accept exact cognate sets as genuine, but cases where there are repeated irregularities despite similarity of phonetic form will be taken as, at least, suspect for reconstruction purposes.

In theory we would like to be able to say how POc speakers would have named each species of bird they were familiar with. Some reasons why this is not possible at the present state of knowledge have already been reviewed. There is also the fact that, even if we take the location and date of the POc-speaking community as fairly precisely known, the composition of the avifauna at that place and time is by no means so certain. The distribution of bird species is a changing set of circumstances, affected both by expansion of successful species and by extinction of others. In practice all we have to go on (except for some scattered archaeological evidence) is the present situation. But even in a situation where several reasonably good cognate sets are available, which could in theory be assigned to several species present in the Oceanic homeland, the assignment may be difficult since our data is weakest precisely in the area where the fauna is richest.

Below I present nearly 200 cognate sets, of which about 80 are attributed to Proto Oceanic and the remainder to various interstages. Following a discussion of the domestic fowl, the families are arranged into three large groups: the non-passerine land and fresh-water birds; the passerines; and the sea and shore birds. A typical local inventory contains roughly equal numbers of species in these three groups. ([Bregulla 1992](Source#cldf:Bregulla1992) on Vanuatu, for example, has 36 passerine species, 45 sea birds and 40 others.) All scientific and ‘common’ English names have been normalised to follow the checklist of [Howard & Moore](Source#cldf:HowardandMoore1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:HowardandMoore1991)).


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. The domestic bird: _Gallus gallus_


The Red Jungle Fowl, (_Gallus gallus_), spread as a domesticate along with Oceanic speakers throughout almost all the Pacific islands. There does not seem to be any clear lexical distinction between domestic and feral birds, though descriptors may be added, as in Samoan _moa ʔāivao_ ‘wild fowl’ (cf _vao_ ‘bush, jungle’). The glosses ‘chicken’ and ‘fowl’ have been taken as equivalent.

A number of Oceanic languages use a word for fowl which is most commonly the generic term for ‘bird’.


<a id="p-284"></a>

<a id="fig-4-6_1"> </a>

[__Figure 6.1:__ _Gallus gallus_, Red Jungle Fowl](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_1)



[PMP &ast;_manuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-4-None-284-POc-manuk-a)

Note that [Bender et al.](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003) ([2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003):327) consider the Micronesian forms to be loans from Chamorro _mannok_ ‘chicken’.

A more widely distributed set of terms for the fowl is clearly an imitative term for the distinctive call of the male bird. A pattern of consonants occurs which could represent POc _&ast;k-k-r-k_, though the vowels are not consistent and one or other of the consonants may not appear. Such distant semblances as Japanese _kokekokko_ and French _cocorico_ ‘cock-a-doodle- doo’ suggest that this sequence may have, contrary to appearances, something natural about it. And yet, the shift of these words from sound-imitative to referential (including the female) cannot have taken place many times independently. I therefore hesitantly offer a reconstruction. However, it is noteworthy that _&ast;k_ in this term is never lenited (to _ɣ_, _ʔ_ etc) in the many languages where this is a regular change. This presumably reflects its onomatopaeic origin.

[POc &ast;_kokorako_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-4-None-284-POc-kokorako-a)


<a id="p-285"></a>

The possible Polynesian reflex of the third term has undergone a significant semantic shift.

[POc &ast;_toqa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-4-None-285-POc-toqa-a)


<a id="p-286"></a>

The common Polynesian word for the fowl has no certain external cognates, though it has apparently been borrowed rather far afield. However, it is possible that Wayan and Bauan _mō_ are cognate with PPn _&ast;moa_, as PCP _&ast;oa_ often becomes _ō_, at least in Western Fijian. If they are, then PCP _&ast;moa_ is reconstructable, but with uncertain denotation.

[PPn &ast;_moa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-4-None-286-PPn-moa-a)


<a id="p-287"></a>

A common observation about animal taxonomy is that terminology for domesticated species will be more detailed than for most wild species—specific names for sexes, ages and varieties are to be expected. This does not seem to be the case for the fowl in Proto Oceanic.

One term, reconstructed as PMP _&ast;qup_a ‘hen, egg-laying chicken’, appears to have Oceanic reflexes only in Polynesian and Rotuman (the latter a borrowing):

[PMP &ast;_qupa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-4-None-287-POc-qupa-a)

The male of the species is most commonly simply denoted by ‘male fowl’ (Manam _maŋ moane_, Motu _kokoruku maruanena_,’Are’are _kua mane_), and chicks as ‘child of fowl’ (Motu _kokoroku natuna_, Cemuhi _nahi-ja_, Bauan _luve ni toa_).


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Non-passerine land and fresh water birds


Though in species numbers they are roughly a third of the total, this group of families accounts for well over half the cognate sets and reconstructions presented here. Land birds are likely to be seen by everyone in the community, and not just those who go to sea. The non-passerines are on the whole larger and more conspicuous than the passerines. They are therefore likely to have names known by everyone. They are also objectively more diverse as a group, and hence more likely to be recognised and lexicalised (Boster, Berlin & O’Neill 1986: 577-578).


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Cassowaries (Casuariidae)


A single species of this family of huge flightless birds, the Dwarf Cassowary (_Casuarius bennetti_), lives in the Oceanic homeland. Although cassowaries do not extend even into the Solomons, enough reflexes exist in languages of the NNG, PT and MM groups to support the reconstruction below. Attribution of such a form to POc is further supported by numerous cognates in languages to the west, e.g. Biak (SHWNG) _(man)swar_, Kaiwai (CMP) _asawar_ ([Anceaux 1961](Source#cldf:Anceaux1961)).

<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Herons (Ardeidae)


The herons of the homeland include three species of large herons or egrets of the genus Egretta as well as the Green-backed Heron (_Butorides striatus_), the Nankeen Night Heron (_Nycticorax caledonicus_) and two bitterns (_Ixobrychus_ spp.). Most cognate sets refer to the large and conspicuous _Egretta_ herons, which may have been the basis for a generic term.


<a id="p-289"></a>

<a id="fig-4-6_3"> </a>

[__Figure 6.3:__ _Egretta sacra_. Reef Heron](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_3)



[POc &ast;_kao(i)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-289-POc-kaoi-a)

It appears that _&ast;kao_ may have been a generic term for herons in PCP. Both Fijian and Polynesian introduce new terms (see below) for _Egretta_, and _&ast;kao_ mainly survives in reference to less conspicuous species. Among Central Pacific reflexes only the Takuu and Maori reflexes may be considered unproblematic. The Nukuoro word is probably borrowed from a Micronesian language.

[POc &ast;_kaopa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-289-POc-kaopa-a)


<a id="p-290"></a>

Both Polynesian Outlier names are presumably borrowed from SE Solomonic languages.

[4-6-5-2-290-tm-buma-ovene](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-290-tm-buma-ovene)

[PNCV &ast;_qova_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-290-PNCV-qova-a)

The relation among the three cognate sets above is not entirely clear. The ordering is based on their successively narrower distribution, from which one might conjecture that _&ast;kao_ was the original POc term, _&ast;kaopa_ an extension of this, and _&ast;qopa_ a truncation of _&ast;kaopa_ restricted to North-Central Vanuatu and its immediate neighbour Temotu area. The above cognate complex is almost unrepresented in the Papuan Tip group, which seems to replace it with the following:

[PPT &ast;_boqe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-290-PPT-boqe-a)

Two of the identifications below are problematic: the Pied Heron, _Egretta picata_, is a mainland species not known to occur in the Bismarcks, and the Grey Heron, _Ardea cinerea_, does not occur in the New Guinea area at all.


<a id="p-291"></a>

[POc &ast;_bʷaro_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-291-POc-baro-a)

A more localised group of cognates in Vanuatu show some resemblance to the above:

[PSV &ast;_bʷan(ie)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-291-PSV-banie-a)

Additional clear but highly localised names in the Solomons, Micronesia and Polynesia also centre around _Egretta_. POc _&ast;sou_ below is suspect as a POc reconstruction as it only occurs in the Solomons. However, Numbami (NNG) _saole_ ‘egret’ may be cognate. If it is, then the POc form was perhaps _&ast;saol_ or _&ast;saul_, but this in turn leaves Numbami final _-e_ for expected †_-a_ unaccounted for, as well as the lack of the final consonant and echo vowel from expected Marovo †_coulu_ Nduke †_houlu_.

[POc &ast;_sou_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-291-POc-sou-a)


<a id="p-292"></a>

[Proto Central Micronesian &ast;_karau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-292-ProtoCentralMicronesian-karau-a)

The Rennellese term seems to agree with the Central Micronesian reconstruction, but borrowing from this direction would be unexpected. No heron terms like this appear to exist in the Southeast Solomons.

[PPn &ast;_matuku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-292-PPn-matuku-a)

[PCEPn &ast;_kautuku~kootuku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-2-292-PCEPn-kautukukootuku-a)


<a id="p-293"></a>

The East Polynesian forms prefixed with _&ast;kō-_ fall into a large class of nouns so reshaped in this subgroup. However, the Hawaiian and Maori terms with _&ast;kau-_ suggest the possibility of influence of the _&ast;kao_ term reconstructed above.

Compared with extensive cognate sets for the Egretta herons, only two small sets appear to denote the Night Herons:

### 5.3. Ducks (Anatidae)


The Pacific Black Duck (_Anas superciliosa_) is the most common duck of the Oceanic region, but the Grey Teal (_Anas gibberifrons_) is also present in the homeland, as are two species of Whistling Ducks (_Dendrocygna_ spp.), and various other species of this family are known as migrants. There is no evidence of domestication of any duck species in pre-European Oceania. Many languages use a separate lexical item for the introduced domesticates, as Samoan _pato_ ‘domestic duck’ (from Spanish), _toloa_ ‘wild duck’. Very few descriptions offer glosses more precise than ‘duck’ or ‘wild duck’. However, Iduna _geluluva_ is explicitly stated to cover both species of Anas mentioned above, and Nelemwa _kerorōp_ includes both these as well as the Mallard, _Anas platyrhynchos_). There may be a terminological agreement between Caaac and Fijian (Lomaivitilevu) in which the Whistling Duck is described as ‘red duck’ (Caaac _nīaŋ mīa_, Fijian _gā-damu_).

The following possible Maori reflex refers to a different waterfowl, but the formal development would be regular. (The grebe is presently found only in the South Island, where Maori _&ast;ŋ_ > _k_.

[Proto South Melanesian &ast;_l(i)aŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-3-295-ProtoSouthMelanesian-lia-a)

PPn _&ast;toloa_ replaces _&ast;ŋaRa_ as the generic term for ‘duck’.

[PPn &ast;_toloa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-3-295-PPn-toloa-a)

A number of other Polynesian and Fijian languages have bird names formally cognate with the above, but referring to shore and sea birds. (A number of these innovations are in the languages of atolls, where ducks are rare or non-occurrent owing to the absence of surface fresh water.):

A strikingly resemblant form occurs in Motu. The only known source of Polynesian loanwords here would be 19th century missionaries from the Cook Islands, but it seems odd to have a wild species named in this way.

### 5.4. Diurnal raptors (Pandionidae, Accipitridae, Falconidae)


These three families are treated together because of obvious similarities in appearance and habits, as well as overlap in naming practices. They are well represented in the homeland, with at least ten species. Roughly from largest to smallest, they include the White-bellied Sea Eagle (_Haliaeetus leucogaster_), the Osprey (_Pandion haliaetus_), several goshawks of genus Accipiter, the Brahminy Kite (_Haliastur indus_), the Black Honey Buzzard (_Henicopernis infuscata_), the Crested Baza (_Aviceda subcristata_), and probably both the Peregrine Falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) and the Oriental Hobby (_Falco severus_).

A very large number of terms for birds of prey are recorded, from which a number of cognate sets emerge; however, associating particular names with particular species is much more difficult, owing in large part to vague descriptions which use ‘hawk’ or ‘eagle’ to refer to any bird of prey.


<a id="s-5-4-1"></a>

#### 5.4.1. Fish-eating raptors (_Pandion_, _Haliaeetus_, _Haliastur_)


Perhaps because of their size alone, these species provide some of the best POc reconstructions. The following set may represent a generic term:

[POc &ast;_taragau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-4-296-POc-taragau-a)


<a id="p-297"></a>

<a id="fig-4-6_5"> </a>

[__Figure 6.5:__ _Haliaeetus leucogaster_, White-bellied Sea Eagle](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_5)



The fish-eagle (Haliaeetus) was probably the largest flying creature known to the Proto Oceanic speakers. (_Haliaeetus leucogaster_ of the homeland is replaced in the Solomons by the very similar _Haliaeetus sanfordi_.) So it is not surprising to find terms for this species literally meaning ‘big bird’ in a number of languages. In all but one of the following, the first element reflects POc _&ast;manuk_ ‘bird’, and the second is the local word for ‘big’. These second elements are etymologically diverse, but Patpatar, Nehan and Puluwatese probably retain the POc form _&ast;lapuat_ ‘large’ ([vol.2:190](ContributionTable?anchor=p-190#cldf:2-6)-191).

[POc &ast;_manuk-lapuat_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-4-297-POc-manuklapuat-a)

The following is formally connected, but from an area with no eagles—perhaps still referring to the largest bird in the area:

[4-6-5-4-297-mic-puluwatese-mallap](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-5-4-297-mic-puluwatese-mallap)

Two other sets are derived from the bird generic _&ast;manuk_, though the second element is less easy to identify.

### 5.5. Megapodes (Megapodiidae)


Megapodes or scrub fowl (_Megapodius_ spp.) are found from the homeland south to Vanuatu and as far east as the island of Niuafo’ou in Tonga. The representative in the homeland is the Bismarck Scrub Fowl (_Megapodius eremita_). All three of the name-sets below may be of imitative origin, given the bird’s two-syllable calls ending in [au]-like sounds. ([Hadden](Source#cldf:Hadden2004a) ([2004a](Source#cldf:Hadden2004a):78) gives ‘_paa-au_’, ‘_keeawau keeawuh_’, ‘_keereow keerow_’ and ‘_kiau kiau_’ as representations of its calls.)

<a id="fig-4-6_8"> </a>

[__Figure 6.8:__ _Megapodius eremita_, Bismarck Scrub Fowl](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_8)



POc _&ast;mʷalau_ is reflected from Sulawesi (Sangirese _maleo_) to the easternmost bird of this family in Tonga ([Wallace 1869](Source#cldf:Wallace1869): 202-4, [Christian 1926](Source#cldf:Christian1926), but see also comments in [Blust 2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002)).

[POc &ast;_mʷalau_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-5-305-POc-malau-a)

An apparent doublet with _&ast;kʷ-_ appears in a number of New Guinea and Solomons languages:

[POc &ast;_kʷal(i)au_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-5-306-POc-kaliau-a)

<a id="s-5-6"></a>

### 5.6. Pheasants and quails (Phasianidae)


Apart from the domestic fowl, the only representative of this family in the homeland is the Indian Blue Quail (_Coturnix chinensis_). In the following comparison, a POc reconstruction is justified if the Mangap and Tolai forms are regarded as continuing the PAn etymon.

<a id="s-5-7"></a>

### 5.7. Rails (Rallidae)


The numerous rails of Oceania include the very widespread Purple Swamphen (_Porphyrio porphyrio_), easily recognised by its large size and red forehead. Among the smaller species are the Buff-banded Rail (_Rallus philippensis_) and White-browed Rail (_Porzana cinerea_), which occur throughout much of the Oceanic region, and in the homeland three others of the genus _Rallus_, as well as the Bare-eyed Rail (_Eulabeornis plumbeiventris_), Red-necked Crake (_Rallina tricolor_), and Rufous-tailed Moorhen (_Amaurornis olivaceus_).

[__Figure 6.10:__ _Rallus philippensis_, Buff-banded Rail](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_10)



Another possible POc reconstruction for the same bird is the following:

[POc &ast;_bʷiru_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-308-POc-biru-a)

The only other rail forwhich widespread cognate sets exist is the Buff-banded Rail (_Rallus philippensis_). The following possible POc reconstruction has only slender support:

[POc &ast;_b(a,e,i)risu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-308-POc-baeirisu-a)

In Vanuatu, a solid set of cognates referring to this bird shows a distinct resemblance to the term for the Swamphen, POc _&ast;bʷalaRe_.

[PNCV &ast;_(b,bʷ)ilake_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-308-PNCV-bbilake-a)

The similarity is enhanced by two SE Solomonic languages in which the word, while still denoting the Purple Swamphen, show unexpected _k_ for _&ast;R_ in the final syllable:


<a id="p-309"></a>

[4-6-5-7-309-ses-gela-bilakebulake](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-309-ses-gela-bilakebulake)

[PNCal &ast;_pit(a,i)ri_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-309-PNCal-pitairi-a)

[PNCal &ast;_biŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-309-PNCal-bi-a)

Proto Central Pacific had a distinct name for the Buff-banded Rail.

[PCP &ast;_weka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-309-PCP-weka-a)

The hypothetical Tahiti Rail (_Rallus pacificus_) is known only from a painting made on Cook’s second voyage (duPont 1976:41), but the name recorded agrees with the evidence of its appearance that it was a species of Rallus.

The only reconstruction for the Sooty Crake (_Porzana tabuensis_) is restricted to Polynesian.

[PPn &ast;_mo(s)o_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-7-309-PPn-moso-a)


<a id="p-310"></a>

The Nukuoro name looks like a regular development of PPn _&ast;moso_, but the Kapingamarangi suggests possible borrowing from Micronesian (cf. Mokilese _mʷiɔk_).


<a id="s-5-8"></a>

### 5.8. Pigeons and doves (Columbidae)


This family is among the most richly elaborated in the Oceanic realm. Almost every island has at least one or two representatives, and the Proto Oceanic speakers may have been acquainted with twenty or more species. The most widely distributed Columbidae belong to two genera: the Imperial Pigeons (_Ducula_ spp.), and the much smaller Fruit Doves (_Ptilinopus_ spp.). Other genera represented include _Gymnophaps_, _Columba_, _Macropygia_, _Reinwardtoena_, _Chalcophaps_, _Gallicolumba_, _Henicophaps_, and the shaggy-plumaged Nicobar Pigeon, _Caloenas nicobarica_.

The most likely candidate for a generic is the following, which is identified as generic in some languages (Gedaged, Tawala, Muyuw), and elsewhere refers to a wide range of columbid genera. In some local areas, however, it appears to have become specialised.

[PAn &ast;_punay_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-310-POc-bune-a)


<a id="p-311"></a>

Another very widespread set is also wide-ranging in its reference, though with a clear focus on genus _Ducula_, at least in Remote Oceanic languages.

#### 5.8.1. Imperial Pigeons (_Ducula_)


The best supported cognate set for this type of pigeon has a PAn antecedent, though the development of PAn _&ast;R_ to POc _&ast;l_ is not regular.

[POc &ast;_bona_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-313-POc-bona-a)

Probably a local development of the above are the following Solomons forms reflecting _&ast;boRa_.

[PNCV &ast;_tutu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-314-PNCV-tutu-a)

Although the following is in near-complementary distribution with POc _&ast;bune_, and could almost be a metathetic development of it, Bauan at least contrasts the two terms.

#### 5.8.3. Ground-feeding pigeons


The following appears to be a local survival of a term reconstructible for PMP, but the glosses, even within the SE Solomonic subgroup, are confusingly diverse.

[PMP &ast;_-muken_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-316-POc-lraumukko-a)

[POc &ast;_butir_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-316-POc-butir-a)

An isolated Micronesian form appears as a possible cognate of this set, Kiribati _pitin_ ‘ground dove, _Gallicolumba_ sp.’. The exact species reference of the Kiribati term is unclear. However, [Pratt et al.](Source#cldf:Prattetal1987) ([1987](Source#cldf:Prattetal1987):194-5) indicate that this bird was introduced to Kiribati (Abemama) about 1940 from some other Pacific island. Since none of the possible source islands have words resembling _bitin_, it would seem much more likely that this name (phonetically [pisin]) is a borrowing from English pigeon.

[PSOc &ast;_mʷaRaki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-316-PSOc-maraki-a)


<a id="p-317"></a>

[PPn &ast;_tū_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-317-PPn-tu-a)

The absence of glottal stop in the Tongan and E Futunan forms shows that this name is likely imitative of the species’ voice, rather than derived from _tuʔu_ ‘stand’ (referring to the species’ ground-feeding habits). However, in languages where the glottal stop has been lost the two would be homophonous, and _tū-kere_ may be understood by present day speakers as ‘stands on the ground’.


<a id="s-5-8-4"></a>

[POc &ast;_woku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-317-POc-woku-a)


<a id="p-318"></a>

Imitative naming is a high probability here; cf. PAn _&ast;qekuŋ_ ‘owl’, PWMP _&ast;bekur_ ‘coo, turtle dove’, PMP _&ast;bukaw_ ‘owl sp.’ ([Blust 2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002)). The voice of _Macropygia mackinlayi_ is represented as ‘kor-wu’ or ‘vo-ku’ ([Hadden 2004a](Source#cldf:Hadden2004a): 114). A metathetic variant is represented by Teop (MM) _uvo_ ‘_Macropygia mackinlayi_’, cf. Koiari (Papuan) _kuvo_ ‘Lesser Bar-tailed Cuckoo Dove, _Macropygia_ nigrirostris’.

[PNCV &ast;_toava_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-8-318-PNCV-toava-a)

The following set undoubtedly owes something to imitation of typical pigeon ‘coo’ vocalizations—low pitched but with strong formant structure. Compare the Wayan Fijian name for a species introduced from Asia in modern times: _kukurū_ ‘Spotted-necked Dove, Streptopelia chinensis‘.

<a id="s-5-9"></a>

### 5.9. Parrots (Loriidae, Cacatuidae, Psittacidae)


The three families united here are represented by nine diverse genera in the homeland. By far the largest bird, not confusible with any other, is the Blue-eyed Cockatoo (_Cacatua ophthalmica_). The large Eclectus Parrot (_Eclectus roratus_) shows striking sexual dimorphism, with males (green) and females (red) often lexically distinguished. The Rainbow Lory (_Trichoglossus haematodus_) is probably the most conspicuous and widespread parrot in western Oceania. Among other middle-sized parrots are the Cardinal Lory (_Chalcopsitta cardinalis_), the Purple-bellied Lory (_Lorius hypoinochrous_) and the Singing Parrot (_Geoffroyus heteroclitus_). Smaller parrots include two Lorikeets of the genus Charmosyna, which, along with the closely related genus Vini, are found as far as eastern Polynesia. Smallest of all are the Pygmy Parrots of genus _Micropsitta_ and the Orange-fronted Hanging Parrot (_Loriculus aurantiifrons_). For the last (which is found no further east than New Guinea) not a single name was found in any of the sources.


<a id="p-321"></a>


<a id="s-5-9-1"></a>

#### 5.9.1. Cockatoos


Only Papuan Tip languages supply sufficient cognates to support reconstructions for these birds. That the first term may be traceable to POc, however, is suggested by possible cognates in SHWNG languages such as Ansus _kara_, Serui-Laut _karai_, Ambai _kara_ ‘cockatoo’ ([Anceaux 1961](Source#cldf:Anceaux1961)).

#### 5.9.2. The Eclectus Parrot


This large parrot (_Eclectus roratus_) is most notable for its sexual dimorphism, with the predominantly red-plumaged female and green-plumaged male sometimes being separately lexicalised. The first two reconstructions are similar in form, and appear to refer to the male. Unfortunately, sources for the few languages that reflect both the shorter and longer term are unhelpful as to the distinction of meaning. Apparent reflexes of the first reconstruction extend well beyond the range of the Eclectus, and are applied to various other species, eventually reaching as far as New Zealand.

#### 5.9.3. Middle-sized parrots


The following four reconstructions appear to be cut from the same basic form: the first with a three-consonant sequence, and each of the others missing one of the three. It would be natural to treat the others as simply variously reduced forms of the longest form, but there are apparent contrasts in several languages. The references are to medium-sized parrots (_Chalcopsitta_, _Lorius_, _Trichoglossus_), but it is difficult to see any consistent association between a particular species and any of these forms. Beyond the Solomons, the first two species disappear, and these terms are applied to Trichoglossus, or in New Caledonia to the parakeets of genus Cyanoramphus.

### 5.10. Cuckoos (Cuculidae)


Eight species of this family are recorded from the homeland, two as seasonal visitors. They include parasitic cuckoos of the genera _Cuculus_, _Cacomantis_, _Chalcites_, _Urodynamis_ and _Scythrops_, and two Coucals of the genus _Centropus_. Names recorded, however, are far fewer than for the parrots with a comparable number of species. Only one small cognate set of Proto Oceanic scope has been found.

### 5.11. Owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae)


The Barn Owls (Tytonidae) and Typical Owls (Strigidae) are each represented in Oceania by a single genus. The Barn Owl (_Tyto alba_) is probably the most widespread owl of the Oceanic region. In the homeland it coexists with the endemic New Britain Barn Owl (_Tyto aurantia_). There are also two Hawk Owls of the genus Ninox. While the voice of the Barn Owl is described as a screech, Typical Owls (like pigeons) have calls whose acoustic profile suggests the low second formant of [u]-type vowels. The Solomon Islands Hawk Owl (_Ninox jacquinoti_), for example, has a call described as ‘’Kuurrroo’ with rolled ‘r” ([Hadden 2004a](Source#cldf:Hadden2004a): 155). The prevalence of such vowels in the first three cognate sets places them under a certain degree of uncertainty. Note, however, that reflexes of _&ast;lulu_ are found mostly in areas where the Barn Owl is the only owl present, and are therefore unlikely to be imitative.

An unusually large number of Polynesian bird names reflect _&ast;lulu_ but are applied to various seabirds (compare _&ast;toloa_, [§5.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3#cldf:4-6)):

There is at present an owl-free area in Eastern Polynesia, which may account for the maritime application of some of these words. However, owls and petrels have in common that they are seldom seen, and mainly known by their calls at night. [Spenneman](Source#cldf:Spenneman2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Spenneman2004):149) notes that _licemᵚao_, the present Marshallese term for the female of the Short-eared Owl (_Asio flammeus_) was given by an earlier source for a type of petrel. (The name is probably analysable as _li-_ ‘feminine prefix’ + ? + _mᵚa_ ‘cry’ + _o_ ‘oh!’.)

### 5.12. Swifts and swallows (Apodidae, Hemiprocnidae, Hirundinidae)


These three groups are closely allied in general appearance and habits and rarely distinguished terminologically. The swiftlets are familiar birds of garden areas throughout much of Oceania. The most common species noted are the White-rumped Swiftlet (_Aerodramus spodiopygius_), Uniform Swiftlet (_Aerodramus vanikorensis_) and White-bellied Swiftlet (_Collocalia esculenta_). These are not in general lexically distinguished. The few terms recorded for the Pacific Swallow (_Hirundo tahitica_) and the even fewer for the Whiskered Tree-swift (_Hemiprocne mystacea_) are often lexically associated with those for the Swiftlets, and where they are not, they do not support any independently reconstructible term. These birds are also terminologically linked with small insectivorous bats: SE Ambrym (NCV) _avœp_ ‘any small bat; swiftlet’; E Futunan _pekapeka_ ‘White-rumped Swiftlet’, _pekapeka saʔi_ ‘small bat sp.’ (see [ch.5, §2.9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-2-9#cldf:4-5)).

### 5.13. Kingfishers (Alcedinidae)


Ten species of Kingfisher are recorded for the homeland, half of them in the genus _Halcyon_, which extends widely through Oceania. Particularly widespread are the White-collared Kingfisher (_Halcyon chloris_), the Sacred Kingfisher (_Halcyon sancta_) and the White-headed Kingfisher (_Halcyon saurophaga_). Other kingfishers of the homeland include the very large White-tailed Kingfisher (_Tanysiptera sylvia_), and the small birds of genera Ceyx and Alcedo. A number of good cognate sets exist, but assignment to species is very problematic. The relatively few terms for non-_Halcyon_ species do not form any useful cognate sets. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002):113) compares POc _&ast;(sj)iko_ with PMP _&ast;cikep_ ‘catch with hands’.

<a id="fig-4-6_15"> </a>

[__Figure 6.15:__ _Halcyon chloris_, White-collared Kingfisher](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_15)



This word appears to have been reshaped in Polynesian to PPn _&ast;tiko-tara_, a compound analysable as ‘defecate’ + ‘end of house’. Some outliers have returned to a historically earlier form through non-Pn influence. The Bauan Fijian word for kingfisher has a general resemblance to the Polynesian _&ast;tikotara_ forms, but cannot be formally reconciled with them; more exact agreement is found in the first part of the word _sikorere_, though with slightly deviant reference:

[4-6-5-13-337-fij-bauan-seala](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-5-13-337-fij-bauan-seala)

The following two sets are likely to be at least influenced by imitation of the voice of _Halcyon_ kingfishers, represented as _ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-i-i-ee_ ([Watling 2004](Source#cldf:Watling2004):137).

### 5.14. Rollers (Coraciidae)


The single species in this family in the Oceanic homeland, the Dollar Bird (_Eurystomus orientalis_) can be associated with two small cognate sets, though there are problems of identification.

[PWOc &ast;_ule(o)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-14-339-PWOc-uleo-a)

The obsolete generic in Roviana most probably refers to the Lineated Cuckoo Shrike (_Coracina lineata_). Since the terms below are distributed only around the Western Oceanic/SE Solomonic boundary, it is possible that terms have been borrowed across the boundary. If so, there is no support for a POc reconstruction.

[POc &ast;_kikiroa~kikiora_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-14-339-POc-kikiroakikiora-a)

There are very similar names for this bird in some Papuan languages of Bougainville, such as Buin _kikitou_, Koromira _mekikiro_, which may be borrowings from Oceanic languages.


<a id="s-5-15"></a>

### 5.15. Hornbills (Bucerotidae)


Two good cognate sets are available for the single species, Blyth’s Hornbill (_Aceros plicatus_), which occurs throughout New Guinea and the Solomons.

[__Figure 6.16:__ _Aceros plicatus_, Blyth's Hornbill](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_16)



The following indicate a considerable broadening of the reference of this term in some SE Solomonic languages:

[4-6-5-15-340-ses-areare-pinaniano](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-5-15-340-ses-areare-pinaniano)

The hornbill’s voice is described as ‘various deep grunts and honking notes’ ([Coates & Peckover 2001](Source#cldf:CoatesandPeckover2001):113). Given the lack of exact agreement among the following names, it is likely that at least some represent repeated imitative coinages.

[POc &ast;_koŋo(k)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-15-340-POc-kook-a)

[PWOc &ast;_komo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-5-15-340-PWOc-komo-a)


<a id="p-341"></a>

The very large bill of the hornbill would account for the mis-identification as ‘toucan’ in the Bugotu and Gela sources. The toucan is a tropical American bird also celebrated for its extremely large bill.


<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Passerine birds


Although the Passerines belong to a single order (Passeriformes) among more than 20 within the class Aves, they account for more than half of all bird species. Yet in the present study there are far fewer cognate sets for passerines than for the rest. On the basis of the Kalam and Tobelo studies, there seems no reason to think that the Proto Oceanic speakers did not name the passerines in as much detail as other types of bird. Two factors may have contributed to the relative paucity of passerine cognate sets. First, many species are highly localised, which may have produced a high rate of turnover (abandonment and recreation of terms) as the Oceanic speakers migrated away from their homeland. Second, since these birds are, on average, smaller and less conspicuous (and of less economic importance) than the non-passerines, an accurate identification would require both a researcher with the means and inclination to go where the birds are, and a speaker as thoroughly informed about the avifauna as were the Oceanic ancestors. It is just this type of information that is lacking for most Oceanic languages; passerines are undoubtedly over-represented among the ‘unidentified bird species’ entries in the dictionaries.

### 6.1. Trillers and cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae)


The cuckoo-shrikes (_Coracina_ spp.) and trillers (_Lalage_ spp.) extend from the homeland into southern Melanesia. Some local cognate sets exist.

### 6.3. Fantails (Rhipiduridae) and flycatchers (Monarchidae)

<a id="s-6-3-1"></a>

The highly distinctive appearance and behaviour of fantails, and their tolerance of human proximity, make them familiar birds, much better represented by widespread cognate sets than the other flycatchers.

In two languages the following element is a body part: Sa’a _pote_ ‘buttocks’, Gela _pege_ ‘forepart of thigh’.

### 6.7. Starlings (Stumidae)


Starlings of the genus Aplonis, and the Yellow-faced Mynah, _Mino dumontii_, extend throughout much of Oceania. The first two cognate sets may be related.

[POc &ast;_pusiRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-6-7-348-POc-pusira-a)

The Shrikebill has in common with the starlings only a similar size and rather drab colouring. The Huia of New Zealand, a much larger bird, presents even less obvious similarity, and may have been named in imitation of its whistling call.

[POc &ast;_bʷisu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-6-7-348-POc-bisu-a)


<a id="p-349"></a>

The definition of Drehet _pʷisi_ is a good description of _Aplonis metallica_. Yapese _gœʔpluw_ ‘small black bird sp.’ bears a striking resemblance to the Rennellese word, but given the lack of precise identification and the absence of known borrowing in this direction, this is probably coincidental.

The following appears to be a continuation of POc _&ast;midi_, reconstructed above ([§6.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-6#cldf:4-6)) as originally applying to honeyeaters, but extended in Polynesia to the starlings and toilers, on the basis of similarities which remain unclear.

Again a single species, the Australian Crow (_Corvus orru_) is present in the homeland, with congenerics elsewhere in Melanesia. Both _&ast;(kao)kao_ and _&ast;kaka_ are likely to show some influence of widespread representations of crow vocalizations such as English _caw_.

## 7. Sea and shore birds


The sea and shore birds have in common that the species tend to be wide ranging rather than localised, many of them migrants or wanderers. The larger families contain numerous species whose field discrimination can be difficult. Observation of these birds becomes more common as sea orientation becomes more dominant, so that the most precise and detailed taxonomies are found in Micronesian and Polynesian languages.

### 7.1. Petrels (Procellariidae, Hydrobatidae)


Petrels come to land only to breed, and may be known primarily from the strange noises they make at their burrows at night. Of several species recorded for the homeland, only the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (_Puffinus pacificus_) breeds in the vicinity and is present year round.

There is a certain degree of crossover apparent between the families of petrels, albatrosses and boobies.

### 7.2. Tropic-birds (Phaethontidae)


The two species of tropic-bird (_Phaethon_) are rare in Papua New Guinea waters but more frequently encountered in Remote Oceania. The Red-tailed Tropic Bird (_Phaethon rubricauda_) and the White-tailed Tropic Bird (_Phaethon lepturus_) differ, as their names suggest, in the colour of the two extremely elongated tail feathers by which this type of bird is readily recognised. They are generally covered by a single lexical item, though there may be a conventional specifier for one or the other, as in Tongan _tavake toto_ ‘_Phaethon rubricauda_’ (_toto_ ‘blood’).

### 7.3. Boobies (Sulidae)


<a id="fig-4-6_20"> </a>

[__Figure 6.20:__ _Sula dactylatra_, Blue-faccd Booby](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-6_20)



Of the three Boobies (genus Sula) found in Oceania, the Brown Booby (_Sula leucogaster_) is present year round in New Guinea waters. The Red-footed Booby (_Sula sula_), however, is also widely reported, while the Blue-faced Booby (_Sula dactylatra_) appears to be the least common. Only in Polynesia and Micronesia are the three species lexically distinguished.

[PROc &ast;_pue_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-3-355-PROc-pue-a)

The following terms for petrels appear to be cognate:

<a id="p-356"></a>

[PNPn &ast;_(maua)kena_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-3-356-PNPn-mauakena-a)

The following also appears to be basically a term for a booby sp., though there is some spread to other sea birds. (The Maori word refers to a gannet, the temperate-zone counterpart of the booby, very similar in appearance and habits.)

[PNPn &ast;_takupu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-3-356-PNPn-takupu-a)

[PNPn &ast;_kanapu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-3-356-PNPn-kanapu-a)

The following three forms suggest POc _&ast;kalau_ ‘booby’, but may be scattered cognates of the previous set. The Nukuoro word is probably borrowed from Micronesia.

[4-6-7-3-357-nng-mangap-kalau](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-7-3-357-nng-mangap-kalau)

### 7.4. Frigate birds (Fregatidae)


Two species of frigate bird are common in New Guinea waters, the Great Frigate Bird (_Fregata minor_) and the Lesser Frigate Bird (_Fregata ariel_). (The identifications of other species for Puluwat and Roviana below are likely to be erroneous.) Two clear POc reconstructions can be justified, though there seems to be no consistent lexical differentiation between the two species in the sources for contemporary languages.

[Proto Northwest Solomonic &ast;_belama_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-4-359-ProtoNorthwestSolomonic-belama-a)

(The glosses for Puluwat _yahaf_ and Roviana _belama_ are probably errors at the species level, as these frigate birds are not known in the Oceanic region.)

[PNCal &ast;_kaidaa(n)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-4-359-PNCal-kaidaan-a)

The Ajie name is explained as ‘the one who tells about the day’.


<a id="s-7-5"></a>

### 7.5. Waders (Charadriidae, Scolopacidae, Burhinidae)


More than twenty species of these shore birds frequent the coasts of the Oceanic homeland, but most are migrants seen only seasonally. Among the most commonly identified are the Bristle-thighed Curlew (_Numenius lahiliensis_), Whimbrel (_Numenius phaeopus_), Bartailed Godwit (_Limosa lapponica_), Wandering Tattler (_Heteroscelus incanus_), Pacific Golden Plover (_Pluvialis fulva_), and Ruddy Turnstone (_Arenaria interpres_). Field identification of these birds can be difficult, and even in Polynesia and Micronesia there are few cognate sets with completely consistent reference.

[POc &ast;_jipiu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-5-359-POc-jipiu-a)


<a id="p-360"></a>

These Polynesian Outlier names are probably borrowings from Southeast Solomonic and Central Vanuatu languages, respectively:

[PPn &ast;_kiu~kiwi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-5-362-PPn-kiukiwi-a)


<a id="p-363"></a>

The set above is perhaps cognate with the set from which PWOc _&ast;kiwiwi_ ‘sandpiper sp.’ (p.360) is reconstructed. There are also probable Western Oceanic cognates, namely Tawala (PT), Gapapaiwa (PT) _kiu_ ‘bird (generic)’ and Nakanai (MM) _e-kivu_ ‘bird sp.’. Together with the set above these imply the reconstruction of POc _&ast;kiu_, but its gloss cannot be reconstructed, as the Tawala and Gapapaiwa generic presumably reflects the promotion of a bird taxon term to generic status, and the Nakanai gloss is not specific.

[PROc &ast;_keke~kaka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-5-364-PROc-kekekaka-a)

Hote (NNG) _kakapʸak_, glossed as a ‘small black bird like a swallow; doesn’t sit in a tree but on rock; morning and afternoon it catches insects in sky’ is a possible Western Oceanic cognate, but its similarity to the items above may be due to chance.

[PPn &ast;_(lafu)lafulafu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-5-364-PPn-lafulafulafu-a)

Finally, one very distinctive shore bird, much larger than the rest, with heavy build and thick bill, is well known in the western Solomons:

<a id="s-7-6"></a>

### 7.6. Terns (Laridae)


The family Laridae includes both gulls and terns. Gulls are mainly birds of the temperate zones, and are only rare visitors to tropical Oceania. The common gloss ‘seagull’ in dictionaries and vocabularies of languages in this area almost certainly indicates a tern. Several species of tern (Sterna, Thalasseus) are common in the waters of the homeland, along with noddies (Anous) and the very distinctive White Tern (_Gygis alba_).

[PMP &ast;_kanaway_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-365-POc-kanawe-a)

Although terns and tropic birds could be confused at a distance, the species identified for Arosi would be a rare stray in this part of the Pacific.

[PMic &ast;_kiakia_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-367-PMic-kiakia-a)

The following two terms from Polynesian Outliers show a closer resemblance to the Halia form above than to the rest of Polynesian, and are probably borrowed from some North Solomons language:

[4-6-7-6-367-pn-takuu-kinakina](cf.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-367-pn-takuu-kinakina)

<a id="p-368"></a>

[PAdm &ast;_baraŋ~rabaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-368-PAdm-bararaba-a)

PAdm _&ast;baraŋ_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Loniu and Nyindrou terms. Mussau _rabaŋana_ points to earlier _&ast;rabaŋan_ (or _&ast;baraŋan_), but the relationship of Mussau to the Admiralties languages is not well enough understood to know what protolanguage this earlier term occurred in.

[PPn &ast;_tala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-368-PPn-tala-a)


<a id="p-369"></a>

[Watling](Source#cldf:Watling2004) ([2004](Source#cldf:Watling2004):208) gives Fijian _tala_ (dialect unspecified) for ‘_Gygis alba_’ but this is unconfirmed by other sources.

The following term for a particular tern species may originate from a compound with _&ast;tala_, though the identity of the second element is unclear.

[PNPn &ast;_&#91;ta&#93;lapiti_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-369-PNPn-talapiti-a)

The noddies are smaller, generally dark-coloured relatives of the terns. Reconstructible terms for them are restricted to Central Pacific languages

[PCP &ast;_ŋoŋo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-6-7-6-369-PCP-oo-a)

The following term, like _&ast;lapiti_ above, may originally have been a compound of _&ast;tala_ with an unidentified second element:

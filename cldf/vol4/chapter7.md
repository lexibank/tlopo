## 1. Introduction


The Oceanic Lexicon Project is concerned both with reconstruction of POc terms and their meanings and with compiling a picture of the kind of culture that can be associated with these reconstructed concepts.[^1] My intention here is not just to identify the insects that existed in the world of Proto Oceanic speakers but also to consider their role in it. Were they dangerous or merely pesky, harmless, insignificant or perhaps useful? Were they associated with the supernatural? The perceived role of an insect depends on the way in which it impinges on human lives, whether by biting or stinging, by being highly visible or noisy, by attacking woodwork or food plants, by being a valued food, and so on. Occasionally we find linguistic clues that throw additional light.

It should be noted that the term ‘insects’ is used here in its popular extended sense to include spiders, centipedes, and other creepy-crawlies such as grubs, worms and leeches.

The difficulty of the task is increased by the sheer size of the Oceanic world, involving as it does many different environments. Compared with other animals, insects are highly adaptable (capable of living in a wide range of environments), easily transportable (by man, animal or wind), and numerous in both kind and number. Consequently, it is difficult to plot the distribution of even a major order, such as scorpions or leeches. Ideally it would be useful to know whether a given creature exists in a region (in one or more readily identifiable species), and if so, whether it has been there at least as long as the first settlers. Even this information is of little use, however, unless we also have local names. Specialised entomological tomes, dealing with, say, the Hymenoptera of Vanuatu, rarely have this information.

For the time being, then, we make do with the most readily available information, culled from general wordlists fleshed out by ethnographic descriptions. Many apparent cognates show unexpected variation in gloss, so that the term for a mosquito in language A becomes that for sandfly in language B, wasp terms move to bee, centipede to millipede, grasshopper to cricket to cicada, and so on. I have to decide if this is due to change in distribution of the creature, or perhaps reflects the insect’s lack of importance to a community, or may be a deficiency in the wordlist.


<a id="p-372"></a>

Another factor to be considered is a seemingly high degree of phonological irregularity in some insect names. This manifests itself at times in collections of terms which share strong resemblance but for which no reconstruction is possible. At other times it results in doublets, where two or more very similar reconstructions can be made for the same insect. Terms for noisy insects are likely to be influenced by onomatopoeia, while terms for insects that jump or sting or tickle may be derived from relevant verbs. This may help explain why I can have several reconstructions for an insect that are based on quite limited cognate sets, but no one dominant form. In contrast, terms such as POc _&ast;kutu_ ‘louse’ and POc _&ast;laŋo_ ‘fly’ are particularly stable, their reflexes occurring in a very high proportion of languages throughout the Oceanic region.

One further concern of this chapter is the role of a particular prefix in insect names as a possible supernatural marker. In 1983 Robert Blust presented a paper at the Third Eastern Conference on Austronesian Linguistics entitled _A linguistic key to the early Austronesian spirit world_[^2]. It dealt with the frequent occurrence of an affix, often fossilised, in Austronesian languages, traceable back to PAn. Its typical form was _qali-_ or _kali-_, although there were a number of variants. Blust listed 62 lexical sets containing over 570 examples from about 50 languages distributed geographically from Taiwan to Polynesia, with the vast majority occurring in Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. When these 62 lexical sets were sorted into semantic categories, 20 were for creepy-crawly life forms, the largest single category. Other categories were bats/birds (six sets including doves, owls), striking natural phenomena (six sets, including rainbows, echoes, whirlpools), body parts (five sets, including pupil of eye, hair whorl), and muddled psychological states (four sets, including being dizzy, talking/walking in one’s sleep). The puzzle for Blust was to assign a single conceptual principle that linked these apparently disparate meanings. If _qali-_/_kali-_ was a morpheme, what did it mean?

He realised that in a substantial number of cases the referents had a connection — most commonly a dangerous connection — with the world of spirits. Insects in particular were associated with spirits of the dead. The _qali-_/_kali-_ terms listed by Blust (updated in 2001b: 37) refer to the following creepy-crawlies: ant/termite, honey bee, bumble bee, beetle, butterfly, caterpillar, centipede, cockroach, crab, cricket, dragonfly, earthworm, firefly, flea, gecko, grasshopper, jungle leech, paddy leech, luminous millipede, scorpion, snake, spider, wasp. Other phenomena he lists (rainbows, whirlpools, sleep-walking etc.) are thought of as supernatural events/conditions. In other words, the _qali-_/_kali-_ terms indicated a taboo, a warning that certain kinds of behaviour were to be avoided in the presence of these creatures or events. It would be an advantage for such taboos to be linguistically clearly marked, to be learned early by children.

Blust strengthens his argument by considering the kinds of insects which are not marked by _qali-_/_kali-_. He sorts them into creatures that (i) tend to invade human space (maggot, horsefly, housefly, both types of lice, mosquito, nit), or (ii) are economically important either because they are edible (sago grub), or because they cause damage to human crops or constructions (termite).[^3] In contrast, the marked creatures have little or no economic importance. In addition, some of these, particularly fireflies and luminous millipedes, have unusual properties which might be regarded as supernatural (pp 37-38).


<a id="p-373"></a>

Blust concludes his argument: ‘In short, then, the function of the _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix evidently was to mark facets of experience that were regarded as spiritually dangerous, hence requiring special precautions of a sort likely to be violated by incompletely accultured children. It did this purely by lengthening the affixed word to an atypical quadrisyllable shape, hence marking the associated semantic categories as those requiring particular behavioural sensitivity’ (p.59).

One of my purposes in this study, then, is to see to what extent _qali_-denoted insects are regarded as creatures with supernatural associations in Oceanic languages. At first glance, it would seem that the Oceanic lexical forms no longer hold the same WARNING TAKE CARE message. Nonetheless, the affix, or traces of it, occurs in a large number of Oceanic languages in a range of insect terms, and I have been able to reconstruct it to POc level in a small number of items.


<a id="s-2"></a>

## 2. Lice (Order Anoplura: Family Pediculidae)


One of the largest cognate sets in the entire lexicon of POc reconstructions is that reflecting _&ast;kutu_ ‘louse’. Its reflexes serve in places as a generic term for lice and fleas, often in compound form, when they refer to other creatures parasitic on plants or animals such as ‘pig louse’ or ‘dog flea’. The very size of the set (I have over 100 reflexes) and their consistency of referent, must reflect its relative salience for witnesses in contemporary languages. The set below is simply a representative sample. Also reconstructed is POc _&ast;tuma_ ‘body louse’. In Nakanai, Roviana and Gela, languages where reflexes of both _&ast;kutu_ and _&ast;tuma_ survive, reflexes of _&ast;tuma_ now refer to ‘flea, house louse, bed bug’, ‘house bug’ or ‘(mat-eating) moth’ respectively. As well, I have a widely reflected term for the louse egg or nit and a number of terms for the action of searching for headlice. This grooming activity was no doubt a regular feature of social life.

### 2.1. Head lice

<a id="s-2-2"></a>

### 2.2. Body lice


Because clothes did not feature strongly in the lives of Proto Oceanic speakers, who did not make use of woven cloth, I have preferred to gloss the POc reflex of PAn _&ast;tumeS_ ‘clothes louse’ as ‘body louse’. These creatures would no doubt have continued to exist in Proto Oceanic household items such as the woven pandanus matting generally used as sleeping mats ([vol.1,80](ContributionTable?anchor=p-80#cldf:1-4)). Although the term has survived in Proto Oceanic, its PAn/PMP meaning has been restored in Niuean and East Futunan reflexes, perhaps fortuituously, through the modern advent of clothing. It seems that in societies where woven clothes were not worn, the distinction between the different kinds of lice was not significant, and either term was used in places as a generic for functionally similar creatures.

<a id="s-2-3"></a>

### 2.3. Nits


In addition to POc _&ast;lisaq_ ‘nit’ I have reconstructed PWOc _&ast;lejaq_ ‘nit’. Both forms are securely based. No language has reflexes of both. Their formal similarity may be due to chance or may reflect an early borrowing.

<a id="s-2-4"></a>

### 2.4. Search head for lice


One POc term and one PROc term have been reconstructed with specific reference to searching for lice. Other terms with more general meaning, particularly POc _&ast;tirop_, _&ast;tirop-i_ ‘look intently’, are sometimes used. In Kove (NNG) the expression is _ravu tuma_ ‘feel for lice’ (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.).These terms indicate the likelihood of reciprocal grooming, an activity undertaken in many societies as part of social interaction.

<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Butterflies (Order Lepidoptera = ‘scaly wings’)


A number of formally similar reconstructions for butterfly have been made above the level of POc: PAn _&ast;(qali)-beŋbeŋ_, PMP _&ast;kali-mbembeŋ_ and PSHWNG _&ast;kalə-mbombəŋ_. From the first-mentioned one would expect the regularly derived POc _&ast;kali-boboŋ_. It does appear, but its reflexes are with one exception limited to the North New Guinea subgroup. The most widespread Oceanic cognate set, yielding POc _&ast;(kau)bebek_, cannot be derived directly from PMP.


<a id="p-378"></a>

[PAn &ast;_qali-beŋbeŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-378-POc-kalibobo-a)

POc _&ast;[kau]bebek_ has reflexes throughout almost the entire Oceanic region apart from NNG. The added _-a_ in Molima, Dobu, Sewa Bay, Duau, Bwaidoga and ’Auhelawa reflects a regular process, but the labialisation of _&ast;k_ is unexpected.

[POc &ast;_&#91;kau&#93;bebek_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-378-POc-kaubebek-a)


<a id="p-379"></a>

One other reconstruction is restricted to Papuan Tip.

[PPT &ast;_qara-bembem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-379-PPT-qarabembem-a)

In Western Oceanic, but with just two reflexes, I find —

[PWOc &ast;_bebelo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-379-PWOc-bebelo-a)

— and in that part of MM which lies within the Northwest Solomons:

[Proto Northwest Solomonic &ast;_pepele_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-379-ProtoNorthwestSolomonic-pepele-a)


<a id="p-380"></a>

What are we to make of these variations? Butterflies, like lice and flies, are commonplace, but whereas I have extremely stable cognate sets for the latter two, butterfly terms in Western Oceanic have many slightly different forms. It is as if there is wordplay, with small changes being deliberately made to a word. Was there something culturally significant about butterflies, perhaps some trace of the supernatural that the _kali-_ prefix reflects, that gave rise to some taboo about the use of the normal term? Although I have examples of an association between butterflies and the supernatural in Sa’a ([Ivens 1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):187), Maori (Andrew Crowe pers. comm.) and Easter Island (Steven Roger Fischer pers. comm.) I have no comparable examples from Western Oceanic. Malcolm Ross (pers. comm.) suggests an explanation involving a different kind of cultural taboo.

There is a widespread origin legend along the New Guinea north coast based on the activities of two brothers, Manub (blue dove) and Kilibob (butterfly), who, between them, ‘made their dwelling places, sun, moon and stars etc. and also the people, and gave them all their customs and usages’ ([Pech 1991](Source#cldf:Pech1991):81). It happens that such legends may be seen to belong to particular clans in their traditional form. Others may continue the legends but lack the right to use traditional names ([Pech 1991](Source#cldf:Pech1991):116). If this were the case, it would be the names, rather than the creature, which were subject to some kind of taboo. It may have been some such reason that is the explanation for the numerous variations in the WOc butterfly term. The EOc terms, however, are quite consistent, all derived from one of the WOc variations, _&ast;bebek_, so evidently no longer subject to the same taboo pressures.

Although POc speakers evidently included moths and butterflies within one generic term, I have a lower-level reconstruction which is limited to moths, possibly a particular kind of moth. Samoan and Tikopia reflect _&ast;lele-fua_ while the Central Eastern Polynesian languages appear to have added a prefix of unclear function.

[PNPn &ast;_&#91;pu&#93;lele-fua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-3-None-380-PNPn-pulelefua-a)


<a id="s-4"></a>

## 4. Mosquitoes (Order Diptera = ‘two wings’: Family Culicidae)


A POc reconstruction for ‘mosquito’, _&ast;ñamuk_, is based on numerous cognates from all major subgroups, with little variation in meaning, together with a PMP antecedent. In some Papuan Tip languages reflexes form compounds to refer to a range of small flying biting insects. The PT reflexes have undergone a common sporadic vowel change, lowering of unstressed _-u_ to _-o_.

A number of terms that refer to the mosquito have been reconstructed in addition to _&ast;ñamuk_.

<a id="fig-4-7_2"> </a>

[__Figure 7.2:__ _Anopheles_ sp., mosquito](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-7_2)




<a id="p-381"></a>

[PMP &ast;_ñamuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-4-None-381-POc-namuk-a)


<a id="p-382"></a>

The following reconstruction shares the same second syllable as _&ast;ñamuk_ ‘mosquito’. Both _&ast;ñamuk_ and _&ast;simuk_ evidently referred to ‘mosquito’ in WOc, although _&ast;simuk_ may have had a broader semantic range than _&ast;ñamuk_, its reflexes at times referring to other small biting flies. Southeast Solomonic terms reflect PSES _&ast;simi_ rather than †_&ast;simu_. (Maringe _si-simi_ is evidently borrowed from a neighbouring SES language). Reflexes of _&ast;simuk_ are not found in subgroups east of the Solomons.

[POc &ast;_simuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-4-None-382-POc-simuk-a)

Another term, POc _&ast;ma-kini(t)_, is also reconstructable, with reflexes thar refer to ‘mosquito’ in Western Oceanic, but in Remote Oceanic rather to the state of being stung. As a literal translation of a form of the verb _&ast;kini-t_, ‘to pinch’, _&ast;ma-kini(t)_ means ‘to get pinched’, i.e. ‘get stung’. The languages in which reflexes of _&ast;ma-kini(t)_ are listed have all lost POc final consonants, and putative final _&ast;-t_ is reconstructed on the basis of etymology. In languages such as (PT) Gumawana, the meaning of the verb _gini_ includes ‘to puncture, spear, inject, sting’. Reflexes of _&ast;kini-t_ appear frequently in PT languages as the second element in compound terms referring to biting insects. (See also POc _&ast;simuk_ above.)

[POc &ast;_ma-kini(t)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-4-None-382-POc-makinit-a)


<a id="p-383"></a>

A tendency to identify small buzzing and biting insects with nasal-initial terms and frequent reduplication is noted with _&ast;ñamuk_ as well as POc _&ast;ŋiŋi(ŋ)_ and PWOc _&ast;ŋati-ŋati_ below, and is apparent also in the terms for sandfly/midge/gnat in the following section (POc _&ast;niku-niku_, _&ast;nonok_, _&ast;ŋi(s,j)i_). Most are onomatopaeic, using _n_, _ñ_ and _ŋ_ almost interchangeably, making it difficult to trace cognate forms.

[PMP &ast;_ŋiŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-4-None-383-POc-ii-a)

[PWOc &ast;_ŋati-ŋati_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-4-None-383-PWOc-atiati-a)


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Sandflies, midges, gnats (Order Diptera: Families Chironomidae (non-biting), Ceratopogonidae, Psychodidae, Simuliidae (biting); Families Drosophilidae, Tephritidae (fruitflies))


Cognates in the following sets refer to a range of very small flying biting insects. Vagueness of identity may be due to the fact that speakers have no real need to distinguish these insects more precisely.

POc _&ast;niku-niku_ from PMP _&ast;nik-nik_ rather than the expected †_&ast;ninik_ may simply be another example of the playful variation prevalent in some insect terms.


<a id="p-384"></a>

[PMP &ast;_nik-nik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-5-None-384-POc-nikuniku-a)

Polynesian reflexes of _&ast;nonok_ ‘sandfly, midge’ appear to refer to fruitflies and perhaps other small non-biting flies. The Cristobal-Malaitan terms reflect PCM _&ast;nono(i)tasi_, literally ‘fly of salt water’.

[PMP &ast;_nek-nek_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-5-None-384-POc-nonok-a)

The next reconstruction is reflected mainly in compound terms which include a range of unidentified elements.

## 6. Flies (Order Diptera: Families Muscidae (houseflies, bluebottles), Tabanidae (horseflies), Bibionidae (Marchflies))



<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Flies (generic); houseflies


[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002)) has reconstructed both PMP _&ast;lalej_ ‘housefly’ and PMP _&ast;laŋaw_ ‘botfly, bluebottle’. The latter became in POc the generic term for flies, with reflexes often referring specifically to the common housefly.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;laŋo_ ‘fly’ are both numerous and widespread, occurring in all major subgroups. In a number of languages including Lou (Adm), Gela (SES) and Hawaiian (Pn), the term is used in compounds as first element, referring to a range of flies (housefly, blowfly, horsefly, March fly, bluebottle fly etc.).

[PMP &ast;_laŋaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-6-1-385-POc-lao-a)


<a id="p-386"></a>


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Horseflies and March flies


Members of the horsefly and March fly families suck the blood of mammals, inflicting a painful bite. Few terms have been collected, and no reconstructions have been possible.


<a id="s-7"></a>

## 7. Dragonflies and damselflies (Order Odonata = ‘flies with teeth’)


Dragonflies and damselflies are arguably the most acomplished aerialists in the animal kingdom. Swift and agile, they can reverse direction in midair within one body length, hover with ease and fly backwards. They copulate in the air, typically over a body of fresh water, where the female lays her eggs. Although cognate sets have been elusive, a remarkable consistency of meaning has emerged in descriptive compounds meaning literally ‘copulate’ + ‘water’, from terms in SE New Britain to the Solomons to Fiji. Terms referring to copulation have evidently been replaced by euphemisms in many languages. Lack of cognacy in the terms for water is due to the tendency in some languages to generalise terms originally referring specifically to fresh water, rain, river, pond and so on. For instance, the second element in the Pendau (central Sulawesi) term for a dragonfly, _tuntu/rano_, translates literally as ‘lake’ (Phil Quick pers. comm.). POc _&ast;waiR_ ‘water’ is attested in the two following (non-cognate) sets by terms from SES, NCV and Fiji.

[4-7-7-None-387-nng-poeng-rorome](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-7-None-387-nng-poeng-rorome)

Other compounds retain the water connection, but vary the verbal concept.

[4-7-7-None-387-pt-sudest-wawaeba](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-7-None-387-pt-sudest-wawaeba)

Samoan retains the skimming element in _seʔe-mū_ ‘dragonfly’ (_seʔe_ ‘glide’, _mū_ ‘flying insect’).

The Rennellese describe it as a sailing insect: _manu-manu hogau_ (_hogau_ ‘sailor, ocean voyager’).

There are isolated instances of dragonflies being used in sorcery, as a means of causing death in Kiribati (Rosemary [Grimble 1972](Source#cldf:Grimble1972):26-27) and to facilitate theft in Tahiti (Henry 1971:391), but rather than reflecting something specific about the role of dragonflies in POc times, this is probably no more than an indication that certain insects were commonly regarded as agents of the gods and spirits.


<a id="s-8"></a>

## 8. Bees (Order Hymenoptera = ‘membrane wings’: Super Family Apoidea)


The following reconstruction rests on a pair of cognates from different primary subgroups.

[POc &ast;_kororo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-8-None-387-POc-kororo-a)


<a id="p-388"></a>

Although the following reconstruction bears some resemblance to PMP _&ast;(n,ñ)ik-(n,ñ)ik_, ‘tiny biting insect: gnat, sandfly, fruitfly’ ([§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:4-7)), it is lacking a final consonant and may simply have been generated independently on onomatopoeic grounds. The initial _ŋ-_ of the Lau and Sa’a cognates is a common variation on _n-_ and _ñ-_ that occurs in terms for buzzing insects.

[POc &ast;_(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-8-None-388-POc-nninni-a)


<a id="s-9"></a>

## 9. Wasps (Order Hymenoptera): Families Ichneumonidae, Vespidae (paper wasp), Sphecidae (mud-dauber wasp, mason wasp)


I have been unable to identify a particular species that can be identified by POc _&ast;pupuk_. It may be a name given to any wasp-like insect that infests wood.

[PMP &ast;_bukbuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-9-None-388-POc-pupuk-a)


<a id="p-389"></a>

The next reconstruction, POc _&ast;bubu_ ‘k.o. wasp’, may simply be a variant of POc _&ast;pupuk_.

[POc &ast;_bubu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-9-None-389-POc-bubu-a)

I am unable to account for the existence of two very similar POc reconstructions for ‘wasp’, _&ast;manipo_ and _&ast;(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)ipo_, although presumably they are contrasted with _&ast;pupuk_/_&ast;bubu_. Nor can they be divided according to their subgroups; reflexes of both appear in the Admiralties and in the Southeast Solomons. Wandamen (SHWNG) _anibar_ ‘wasp/bee’ may be a non-Oceanic cognate. A third group reflects Proto Central Papuan _&ast;naniɣo_. It seems that here we have yet another example of wordplay. It is difficult to know whether the resemblance between _&ast;(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)ipo_ ‘wasp’ below and _&ast;(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)i_ ‘bee, buzzing insect’ ([§8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-8#cldf:4-7)) arose by chance or reflects common ancestry in some way.

In the next set we find the same lowering of an unstressed vowel from /_-u_/ to /_-o_/ in Papuan Tip languages that was noted in reflexes of POc _&ast;ñamuk_ ([§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:4-7)).

## 10. Ants (Order Hymenoptera: Family Formicidae)



<a id="p-391"></a>

Although sources for a number of languages give a term for ants in general, I cannot reconstruct a POc generic. It is likely that the dominant ant species varies from place to place, and that the term for that species has become the generic term in that area. In Yabem (NNG), for instance, the generic term is _lêsêʔ_, in Sudest (PT) it is _vwara-vwara_, in Vitu (MM) _duri-duri_, and in Kwaio (SES), _ta-galo_. In Wayan Fijian _kadi_ (from POc _&ast;kadik_ ‘stinging black ant’) has become the generic. In Niue and Tonga, _lō_ (from POc _&ast;loRo_ ‘large red stinging ant’) is the generic form. However, a number of POc reconstructions can be made for ant taxa.

[POc &ast;_kadik_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-10-None-391-POc-kadik-a)

Rufus Pech refers to the stinging red ant of the north New Guinea coast (_lol_ in Tami) in the following way: ‘This is perhaps the most enterprising and obviously ubiquitous species of ant in the Melanesian lowlands. They build huge nests in trees by drawing and sticking together bunches of leaves, are carnivorous, and defend their territory ferociously.’ ([Pech 1991](Source#cldf:Pech1991):91). POc _&ast;loRo_ probably referred to this group of ants although witnesses in Eastern Oceanic have a wider range of reference.

[PMP &ast;_loRo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-10-None-391-POc-loro-a)

The next set is possibly a compound form of the above.

[PPn &ast;_lō-qata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-10-None-392-PPn-loqata-a)

The three reconstructions which follow, POc _&ast;drui_ ‘ant’, POc _&ast;[driu]driu_ ‘small red or brown ants’ and PWOc _&ast;didi_ ‘small ant’ may all be variants of the same etymon.

## 11. Termites (Order Isoptera = ‘equal wings’)


POc _&ast;ane_ is well-supported as a term for ‘termite/white ant’. There are occasional mentions of an association of white ants with the supernatural in SES languages. In Arosi _ane-hau_ refers to ‘k.o. white ant that lives in the ground; these ants were thought to be incarnations of the dead’, while in Sa’a they are ‘the food of ghosts on Malapa’. However, they would have been regarded as pests, and it is not surprising that we have no record of their ever being referred to by a _&ast;kali-_ term.

## 12. Crickets, grasshoppers (Order Orthoptera - ‘straightwings’); Cicadas (Order Hemiptera= ‘half wings’)


<a id="fig-4-7_4"> </a>

[__Figure 7.4:__ _Gryllus_ sp., cricket](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-7_4)



If a generic term existed in POc, either for grasshoppers, or for grasshoppers + crickets + cicadas (+ mantises), I have not been able to reconstruct it. Although I have a number of reconstructions, their reflexes show considerable variation in gloss. Some terms refer to ‘singing insect’, which may indicate either cricket or cicada. Lack of agreement in glosses may reflect indifference among speakers, although I would expect a generic term if particular varieties were not seen as important. Some languages have simply adopted verb forms for ‘grasshopper’ - etymons from Kove (_piti-piti_ ‘jumping insect found in beach rubbish’) and Raga (_visi[ribi]_ ‘taro plant hopper’) are from POc _&ast;pitik_ ‘spring up suddenly’/ POc _&ast;pitik-pitik_ jump repeatedly. In Dobu crickets are named _kelei ʔana toeʔita_, literally ‘wallaby’s teacher’ (Ralph Lawton. pers. comm.). A grasshopper named _kokoru-bote_ in Arosi is remarkable for the use found for it. It is described as ‘a large grasshopper, put on one’s head to eat lice’ (from _koru_ ‘eat’, _bote_ ‘lice’). Together with mantises and stick insects, grasshoppers and crickets are valued as food. Kwaio has a term, _faʔafulu_ glossed as ‘generic term for edible insects, incl. grasshoppers, stick insects etc.’ Their appeal would no doubt be as a kind of snack food, a chance variation on their regular diet.

<a id="p-398"></a>

Although there is some confusion of gloss within cognate sets, it seems clear that POc speakers distinguished praying mantises (_&ast;papa_) from stick insects (_&ast;mimis-mata_). The ability to project a milky chemical painful to the skin which is reflected in POc _&ast;mimis-mata_ is a defensive mechanism of at least some stick insects (Serkan Alasya, CSIRO Entomology, pers. comm.).

[PMP &ast;_(kali)papa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-13-None-398-POc-papa-a)

POc _&ast;mimis-mata_, literally ‘urinate’ + ‘eye’, reflects awareness that the stick insect can eject a fluid which causes pain if it touches the eye. One of the better-known Phasmatodea of the Oceanic region is Megacrania batesii, the pandanus stick insect.

Closely related to stick insects are leaf insects. The only terms I have located are descriptive compounds: Tawala (PT) _hiaga luguna_ (_hiaga_ ‘?’, _lugu_ ‘leaf’), Tongan _moko-moko tuʔaniu_ (_moko-moko_ ‘crawling insect, _tuʔaniu_ ‘midrib of coconut leaflet’), and Rennellese _manu gaukei_ (‘insect’ + ‘leaf’).

Some varieties of mantis and stick insect are listed as edible in a number of languages.

## 14. Fireflies (Order Coleoptera = ‘sheath wings’: Family Lampyridae)


Judging from ethnographic references and brief elaborations in wordlists, it is fireflies, among all the insects of the Oceanic world, which are most associated with supernatural qualities. For Takia (NNG) speakers, a firefly, _lutot_, is thought to be a messenger of someone’s death (Bugenhagen wordlist). The term for a firefly in Sissano (NNG), _mas eyiaw_, is a compound term, _mas_ being defined as ‘devil; spirit of dead relative’ and _eyiaw_ as ‘evil spirit; thief’ (Whitacre wordlist). Seligmann quotes a report from Bartle Bay (Wedau, PT) that ‘if a firefly enters a house at night, it is a sign that someone in the house will die.’ (1910:653). Molima (PT) speakers regard fireflies as emissaries of witches who enter the house at night in order to report back on who is there, and for that reason they are killed as soon as they are seen (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). In Nakanai (MM), although its speakers consider that fireflies embody spirits of the dead, they are delighted if a firefly enters the house at night, because it is a sign that someone recently dead is paying a visit (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). Ivens writes that fireflies are popularly classified as ghosts in Sa’a and Ulawa (1927:189), and in his Sa’a dictionary he defines fireflies (_pulu-pulu_) as ‘souls of dead persons’. The Tolo people of Guadalcanal regard cicadas and fireflies as the ghosts of unknown people, or ghosts of the forest ([Ivens 1930](Source#cldf:Ivens1930):229). Tamambo (NCV) speakers are frightened of them, and try to avoid them as ‘little devils’ (Dorothy Jauncey pers. comm.). In Wayan Fijian, fireflies (_tōtōvuata_) are believed to be a sign of the gods inspecting fruit crops. The Rennellese see a firefly as the embodiment of a goddess.

The belief that fireflies are messengers of doom is an ancient one among Austronesian speakers. Blust (pers. comm.) provides additional evidence from Isneg (northern Philippines) that fireflies are precursors of death, and Karo Batak (northern Sumatra) where their presence in a house signals that thieves will come. Of all POc reconstructions, then, I should expect that for ‘firefly’ to be most likely to retain the _kali-_/_qali-_ indicator of supernatural status. I have limited evidence supporting two reconstructions derived from PMP _&ast;qali-petpet_, POc _&ast;qali-popot_ ‘firefly’ and POc _&ast;(k,q)ali-totop_ ‘firefly’, the latter with metathesis. POc _&ast;(k,q)ali-totop_ depends on one reflex, from Rennellese, for reconstruction of its first element and on another, Nduke, for reconstruction of its second element.

<a id="p-400"></a>

A putative reconstruction, POc _&ast;bulu-bulu_ ‘firefly’, must be regarded as dubious because witnesses are from adjoining subgroups where borrowing cannot be ruled out. Etymons may be derived from POc _&ast;bulut_ ‘gum’ whose reflexes can include ‘a torch (of gum)’, and thus extend to ‘light, firefly’.

[4-7-14-None-400-mm-nehan-bolbol](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-14-None-400-mm-nehan-bolbol)

## 15. Beetles (Order Coleoptera)


Although there are thousands of different beetle species, very few taxa are named in wordlists. Only two POc reconstructions have been made, and in the first listed below there are grounds for believing that the gloss given in many of the daughter languages is a recent adaptation. The large rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), which bores into the crown of the coconut palm and is considered a serious pest in many parts of the Pacific, is believed to have been introduced from southeast Asia only in the 20th century ([Gressitt & Homabrook 1985](Source#cldf:GressittandHomabrook1985):34). A beetle similar in appearance and behaviour is Xylotrupes gideon, found in almost all parts of New Guinea. Presumably, speakers used an existing beetle term to refer to the introduced beetle. The second reconstruction, POc _&ast;kamak_, probably refers to longicorn beetles, those with extremely long antenna (Family Cerambycidae), the larvae of which attack timber.

<a id="p-402"></a>

A surprising omission from most wordlists are terms for the taro beetle (Papnana uninodis). Although these beetles may be as long-established in the region as the tubers which we know were cultivated in Proto Oceanic times, I have not been able to reconstruct a term for them other than PSES _&ast;ko[l,R]o-ko[l,R]o_ ‘beetle that attacks plants’. Damage to the tuber is caused by the adult beetles, and not by their larval stage which feeds on soil and roots (Robin Hide, pers. comm.). I can locate very few terms for the pest in Western Oceanic languages, none cognate. Although damaged tubers cause significant economic loss in today’s marketing terms, it may be that the damage was of little significance when tubers were primarily for home consumption.

Wordlists contain a few references to edible beetles. Sudest (PT) has a term _gilai_ ‘a large black sago beetle; people eat both the adults and the larvae’; Nakanai (MM) has _komaga_ ‘an edible insect like a long thin black beetle’ and _bureka_ ‘large (6 ins) edible insect found in trees’; Wayan (Fij) has _gou_ ‘large beetle, _Coleopterus_ sp., 2 inches long with hard shell. Eaten by some people’.

## 16. Cockroaches (Order Blattodea = ‘light avoiders’)

## 17. Grubs, caterpillars


Grubs and caterpillars are the larval stages of beetles (Coleoptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera). Particular kinds are more likely to be named if they are a useful food source, or if they attack crops.


<a id="p-404"></a>

One which is widely recognised is the edible sago grub (Order Coleoptera, family Curculionidae), a valuable source of protein. Sago grows in low-lying, swampy areas of Melanesia where other food plants do not thrive. Lack of the means of a varied diet may contribute to the specialised sago grub cultivation employed by the Labu (NNG) people.[^9] In Sissano the sago grubs, _yiat_, are used in food offerings to the spirits in some healing ceremonies (Whiteacre wordlist).

The Admiralties languages in the next set all have _-e-_ for †_-a-_.

[PMP &ast;_qabated_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-17-None-404-POc-qapator-a)


<a id="p-405"></a>

POc _&ast;muno_ may have been a generic term for caterpillars. Reflexes are not found in Central Pacific where a reflex of POc _&ast;qanupe_ is the most widespread term for ‘caterpillar’.

[POc &ast;_muno&#91;-muno&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-17-None-405-POc-munomuno-a)

WOc cognates of POc _&ast;qanupe_ refer to trepangs,[^10] also known as bêche-de-mer or sea slugs ([ch.4, §5.2.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-2-1#cldf:4-4)), while Eastern Oceanic cognates refer to caterpillars. Without external cognates, the meaning of POc _&ast;qanupe_ is indeterminate.

## 18. Centipedes (Class Chilopoda): Millipedes (Class Diplopoda)


Another _&ast;qali-_ term, POc _&ast;qalipan_ ‘centipede’, is reconstructable, probably embracing millipedes as well. Evidence of an association between centipedes and the supernatural comes from ethnographic descriptions as well as linguistic clues. For instance, Sengseng (NNG) speakers consider centipedes to be supernatural beings, and carefully remove them from their houses (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). Elbert’s Rennellese dictionary defines _ʔagi-paipai_ as ‘centipede, considered the embodiment of non-worshipped deities and a loathsome creature’. In his Tikopia dictionary Firth defines _morokau_ as ‘centipede. Trad. held to be frequent embodiment of spirit’. There is also a Samoan term _atua-loa_ ‘k.o. centipede with poisonous bite’, whose prefix _atua-_ has supernatural significance (discussed in [§27](ContributionTable?anchor=s-27#cldf:4-7)). In addition to the _&ast;qalipan_ cognate set I list non-cognate terms for centipede from a range of languages across several subgroups which all exhibit a reflex of the _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix.

Reflexes of _&ast;qalipan_ are numerous and widespread. As well, I have a number of lower-level reconstructions, possibly for particular kinds of centipede. Two kinds of centipede/millipede are described in wordlists, categorised by behaviour or luminosity rather than number of legs. One, when threatened, squirts a kind of acid from between its scales which can cause blisters or even permanent eye damage, while a second is described as phosphorescent or luminous. A millipede in Arosi (SES), _doŋa_, is also singled out as having a vile smell. I have one lower-level reconstruction for the luminous variety, PPn _&ast;taqe-tuli_ ‘phosphorescent centipede or millipede’, whose first element is derived from POc _&ast;taqe_ ‘excrement’, implying strongly that the creature is considered unpleasant in Central Pacific languages. In Tahiti, however, where there are two kinds, not venomous, one short and thick and light brown, the other long, threadlike and phosphorescent, they were well regarded. Teuira Henry (1971:391) writes that ‘when a centipede fell upon a wound or bruise of any kind, it soon healed. If it crawled upon a sick person, a speedy recovery followed.’

Other terms for centipede which apparently exhibit a reflex of the _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix include:

[4-7-18-None-407-adm-drehet-kxanepup](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-18-None-407-adm-drehet-kxanepup)

The compound terms below yield a reconstructed first element, PWOc _&ast;mʷali-_.

[PWOc &ast;_mʷali-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-18-None-407-PWOc-mali-a)

POc _&ast;weli_ (1) ‘fireworm, sea centipede’; (2) ? ‘k.o. millipede’ is included in [chapter 4, §7.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7-2#cldf:4-4).

[PPn &ast;_taqe-tuli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-18-None-407-PPn-taqetuli-a)


<a id="p-408"></a>

In Bugotu (SES) the term for a phosphorescent centipede, _liva tora_, is a literal description: (_liva_ ‘centipede’, _tora_ ‘phosphorescent’).

Reflexes of a reconstruction from a different semantic field, POc _&ast;taqe_ ‘excrement’ (see ch.2, p.60), have extended their meaning to refer to a centipede in Kahua (SES) and Bauan Fijian and a scorpion in Tamambo (NCV) and Anejom (SV), no doubt reflecting their common characterisation as painful stinger.


<a id="s-19"></a>

## 19. Scorpions (Class Arachnida: Order Scorpiones)


A substantial number of terms for scorpions have been collected, but only a single reconstruction, Proto SE Solomonic _&ast;vari_ ‘scorpion’ (not listed here) has been possible. In the Solomons, many terms are compounds or phrases which include the word for centipede (Gela _liva-ni mala_, Birao _kaukau-liva_, Lengo _aliva-ni-ɣoro_). Although centipedes and scorpions belong to different zoological classes, the linking of the two creatures in this way may be due to the similar appearance of grasping pincers, and to the facts that both are capable of delivering a severe bite or sting, and both frequent the same habitat, under rocks or leaf litter. The scorpion is named as crab-like in Gapapaiwa (_gʷaɣa-gʷaɣa_ ‘scorpion; idiom for one who moves slowly and fearfully on heights) (_gʷaɣa_ ‘crab (generic)’) and possibly also in Molima (_dowa_ ‘scorpion, land crab’), although Chowning adds a question mark to her gloss.

<a id="s-20"></a>

## 20. Spiders (Order Araneae)


Although POc speakers would undoubtedly have named a range of spiders, I have not been able to link reconstructions with specific kinds of spider. I have only one lower-level example in which a name is assigned to a particular spider — PCP _&ast;tuku-tuku_ ‘k.o. spider that lets itself down by a single thread’. POc _&ast;lawaq_, traceable back to PAn, with cognates right across the Oceanic region, may have referred primarily to ‘spider’ but by POc times had come to refer as well to ‘spider web’ and ‘k.o. fish net’ (see [vol.1,212](ContributionTable?anchor=p-212#cldf:1-8)). I also find a number of reconstructions with formal similarities, including POc _&ast;koko_, POc _&ast;gagao_~_&ast;(g,k)a(g,k)a-_, PWOc _&ast;kuku_, and PEOc _&ast;[ko]ko-miji. Some kind of word play has evidently taken place, although I have no ethnographic evidence that particular spiders are associated with any kind of supernatural belief or taboo. On the contrary, they are freely eaten in many communities. Wordlists of a number of languages including Molima and Sinaugoro (PT), Takia (NNG) and Hawaiian (Pn), record particular kinds of edible spider.

Reconstructions other than _&ast;lawaq_ have an unusually large number of reflexes which are compounds with a non-reflected element. These reconstructions may refer to particular kinds of spider. As [Pawley](Source#cldf:Pawley2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:Pawley2000): 8) has noted, names for folk specifics in plants and animals, or, to be more exact, the secondary or modifying terms in binomials, are notoriously unstable and will, in most cases, not be reconstructable for a language as remote in time as POc.


<a id="p-409"></a>

[PAn &ast;_lawaq_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-20-None-409-POc-lawaq-a)

PPn _&ast;lewe_ is probably cognate, with reduplication and addition of the prefix _&ast;ka-_, which may reflect _&ast;kʷakʷa_, discussed below the next item.

In the cognate set below the Malai (NNG) term and those from the Malakula languages Nahai’i, Axamb and Nisvai (NCV) speak in favour of a freestanding POc _&ast;gagao_, whilst the Molima (PT), Teop, Simbo, Torau, Kia, Kokota (all MM) and Gela (SES) terms point to _&ast;gaga-_ and _&ast;kaka-_ as forms occurring in compounds.

[POc &ast;_gagao~(g,k)a(g,k)a-_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-20-None-409-POc-gagaogkagka-a)


<a id="p-410"></a>

POc _&ast;koko_ and PWOc _&ast;kuku_ may be variants of the same term as _&ast;kaka_. Two alternate hypotheses about their origins are (a) that _&ast;ko_ reflects the second syllable of _&ast;gagao_, and (b) that the reflexes supporting _&ast;kaka-_, _&ast;koko_ and _&ast;kuku_ reflect POc _&ast;kʷakʷa_. Evidence for (b) is that (i) SE Solomonic languages retain _k-_ and this is diagnostic of POc _&ast;kʷ-_, and (ii) Western Oceanic (PT, MM) reflexes other than Simbo retain _k-_ rather than leniting it to _ɣ-_ or zero, the usual reflexes of _&ast;k-_.

POc _&ast;koko_ becomes _&ast;[ko]ko-miji_ ‘k.o. spider’ in PSES with the addition of _-miji_ an element which occurs also in other compounds meaning ‘spider’ (Dori’o [SES] _kala-midi_) although not found separately. It also may occur in Nakanai _kamimisi_ ‘spider’, if intepreted as _kami-misi_ with _kami-_ < _kali_ by assimilation. I am unable to suggest a meaning for POc _&ast;-miji_, other than to note that I have found it only in spider terms.

## 21. Leeches (Class Hirudinea)


There is a well-supported POc reconstruction for ‘leech’ based on reflexes in NNG, PT and NCV languages. I have not so far located any term for leech, cognate or otherwise, east of Fiji, and assume that the creatures are not found in Micronesia or Polynesia (with the exception of New Zealand, where the Maori term is _ŋata_ i.e. ‘snake’) (Ross Clark, pers. comm.). Pawley has reconstructed a similar term, PROc _&ast;drumane_ ‘anemone’ ([ch.4, §6.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-1#cldf:4-4)) which is almost in complementary distribution, and the terms may be related.

## 22. Worms



<a id="s-22-1"></a>

### 22.1. Worm (generic)


There is a widespread belief among Austronesian speakers that dental caries is caused by a small worm. Both the creature and the associated condition are named in different languages by reflexes of various reconstructed terms for ‘worm’. Blust comments on two WMP languages, Cebuano and Malagasy, whose reflexes of PAn _&ast;qulej_ ‘maggot’ refer also to ‘tooth decay’ or ‘toothache, supposed to be occasioned by a small worm in the tooth’ (ACD) ([§23](ContributionTable?anchor=s-23#cldf:4-7)). Dobu (PT) has a term _kimʷata_ ‘the supposed insect which causes caries in children’ (_mʷata_ ‘snake’). The To’aba’ita term is _wā-lifo_ ‘tooth decay, believed to be caused by worms’ (_wā_ ‘worm, grub, maggot, caterpillar, larva’, _lifo_ ‘tooth’). Other WMP languages refer to tooth decay by reflexes of PMP _&ast;bukbuk_ ‘weevil that infests wood, bamboo, and rice; dust produced by the boring of this insect; tooth decay’ (ACD) ([§9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9#cldf:4-7)). Codrington also reports the belief as existing in the Banks Islands (NCV) (1891:193).

It seems likely that POc _&ast;mʷata-mʷata_, the reduplicated form of _&ast;mʷata_ ‘snake’, was a generic for worms and worm-like creatures, including caterpillars and millipedes. In places it has reverted to its unreduplicated form, either as a generic for snakes and other snake-like creatures, or, as in Micronesia and Seimat, to refer to worms alone. In Micronesia there are no snakes except on Guam, where they have been introduced in comparatively recent times (Jeff Marck, pers. comm.), and hence there is no need to maintain the distinction. I have not been able to ascertain if snakes are found in the Ninigo Islands, where Seimat is spoken.

### 22.2. Other worm taxa


Blust has reconstructed PMP _&ast;bulati_ ‘roundworm, ascaris, intestinal worm; also earthworm?’ (ACD) without Oceanic reflexes. I have reconstructed POc _&ast;sulati_ ‘worm’ which evidently carries a common root, _-lati_. The Oceanic evidence does not permit further differentiation of meaning.

[POc &ast;_sulati_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-22-2-413-POc-sulati-a)

The next reconstruction, PNGOc _&ast;dimʷan_ ‘k.o. worm’, bears some similarity to POc _&ast;droman_ ‘leech’ but a contrast is preserved in some languages, e.g. Molima _domana_ ‘mountain leech’, _dimʷa-mʷana_ ‘worm’; Dobu _domana_ ‘leech’, _di-dimʷana_ ‘common earthworms, small lizards’; Gapapaiwa _domani_ ‘leech’, _dimo(moga)_ ‘earthworm’; Sinaugoro _doma_ ‘leech’, _dimo_ ‘worm’). The resemblance appears to be accidental.

<a id="s-23"></a>

## 23. Maggots


POc _&ast;quloc_ continues the PAn term for ‘maggot’, _&ast;qulej_. Some reflexes show /_i_/ instead of /_u_/ in the first vowel, a common sporadic change in many forms.

[PAn &ast;_qulej_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-7-23-None-414-POc-quloc-a)


<a id="p-415"></a>

The next reconstruction illustrates what was evidently a productive process in POc, the addition of _-a(n)_ to a term X, where X could be water, sennit, people, pigs etc., to indicate a state of being ‘full of X’ or in the case of insects, infested with the insect. Besides POc _&ast;qulos-a(n)_ ‘be maggoty’ I can reconstruct PEOc _&ast;kutu-a(n)_ ‘(be) lousy’ (To’aba’ita _ʔu-la_, Samoan _ʔutu-a_, Pukapukan _wutu-a_). Further examples from SES languages show the process applied to other insect names: Sa’a _pote_ ‘head louse’, _pote-la_ ‘lousy’; To’aba’ita, Lau _wā_ ‘maggot, worm’, _wā-la_ ‘maggoty, wormy’, and I add a Polynesian example, Tongan _moŋomoŋa-ʔia_ ‘infested with beetles or cockroaches’, from _moŋomoŋa_ ‘any kind of beetle or cockroach’.

Reduplication on verbs serves to indicate frequentative aspect, while its nominal counterpart means ‘full of, lots of N’.

The following set consists of cognates with a range of glosses which can only be subsumed under one generalised reconstruction.

<a id="s-25"></a>

## 25. Semantic extensions and generalisations


Chapter 8 contains a detailed examination of _&ast;manuk_ and _&ast;manu-manuk_. POc _&ast;manuk_ evidently had two senses, one restricted, the other extended. The restricted sense was ‘bird’ or more precisely ‘bird + bat’, hence ‘flying vertebrate’. The extended sense was ‘creature’, probably excluding people and things that swam in the sea. In POc, diminutives were regularly formed by reduplication. So _&ast;manu-manuk_ meant either ‘small flying creature’, or simply ‘small creature’. Beyond that I have only fragments of information to go on as clues to how POc speakers classified their world of insects and other creepy-crawlies. It is likely that most languages had generic terms for butterflies, flies, spiders, hoppers, ants, grubs and so on, although I have been able to reconstruct reliable generic terms for only the first two.

There is some evidence that there were two broader categories in PPn, the flying creatures, _&ast;manu-lele_ and the crawlers, _&ast;manu-totolo_. Rennellese has _manu-manu-gege_ ‘flying/jumping creatures’, and _manu-manu-totogo_ ‘creeping creatures’, the latter including reptiles other than turtles. Nanumea, a dialect of Tuvalu (Pn), has forms cognate with the Rennellese, _manu lele_ ‘bird, flying insect’ and _manu totolo_ ‘ground animal e.g. spider, lizard, land mammal’. Niue also has cognate terms but insects are excluded in both: _manu lele_ ‘bird, can include flying fox but not flying insects’ and _manu totolo_ ‘any walking or crawling creature but not insects’. Speakers of the Hula dialect of Keapara (Papuan Tip) distinguish _manu-manu_ ‘flying insect’ and _mani-mani_ ‘creeping insect’. According to [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1974) ([1974](Source#cldf:Fox1974)), Lau (SES) divides the entire animal kingdom three ways, with _wāwā_ ‘generic for all creatures in or on the ground’, _manu_ ‘generic for all creatures that fly’ and _iʔa_ ‘generic for all creatures in water’.


<a id="p-417"></a>

The following example illustrates how one particular term may serve as the name of a class, in this case ‘fly’, and also be used as the first element in binomials defining members of that class. Examples include:

[4-7-25-None-417-adm-lou-lalaa](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-25-None-417-adm-lou-lalaa)

In some Polynesian languages the reflex of POc _&ast;moko_ ‘k.o. snake’ (p.260) has become a class marker for a whole range of creepy-crawlies:

[4-7-25-None-417-pn-niuean-moko](cf.csv#cldf:4-7-25-None-417-pn-niuean-moko)


<a id="p-418"></a>

In some Polynesian languages, small lizards and certain other creepy crawlies are lumped together in a higher order taxon. POc _&ast;mʷata-mʷata_ ‘worm’ is the diminutive of _&ast;mʷata_ ‘snake’.[^11] Note also Dobu (PT) _didi mʷana_ ‘common earthworms, small lizards’.

Similarities in behaviour form the basis of other groupings. In Tamambo (NCV), the reflex of POc _&ast;(ñ,n)opuq_ ‘stonefish’ refers to ‘centipede or scorpion’ as well as ‘venomous fish’. The semantic link is clearly ‘painful stinger’. The Polynesian language of Rennell has extended the meaning of _kutu_ (from POc _&ast;kutu_ ‘head louse’) to refer to ‘louse, bird louse, mite, leech and tiny insects of various kinds’. The term has presumably come to mean ‘small blood-sucker’, when no more specific reference is necessary. In Marquesan the reflex of POc _&ast;quloc_ ‘maggot’, _iʔo_, now refers to bugs and worms.

Some languages have developed and named unusual groupings. For instance, the Motu have a term, _kikiri kikiri_, which refers to ‘all creatures which live on the ground but jump or fly short distances. Cicadas and hawk moths are _kikiri kikiri_. So are beetles that make noise’ (Nigel [Oram n.d.](Source#cldf:Oramnd)). In Kwaio, there is a collective term, _faʔa_/_fulu_, for edible insects.


<a id="s-26"></a>

## 26. Stability and variability of terms


A small number of POc insect names show far greater stability than others. In a survey of 25 dictionaries chosen on comprehensiveness and whose languages together covered all major subgroups,[^12] reflexes of _&ast;kutu_ ‘louse’ were listed in 23, _&ast;laŋo_ ‘fly’ in 22, _&ast;ñamuk_ ‘mosquito’ in 21, _&ast;bebek_ ‘butterfly’ in 16, and _&ast;qapator_ ‘sago grub, edible’ in 13. In an email comment on seahorse terms Robert Blust wrote that ‘The general principle for flora and fauna seems to be that if it was economically useful or dangerous it was named, and the more useful or dangerous the more stable the name historically.’[^13] With insects, it seems that the more intrusive in everyday life, the more commonplace and either pesky or valued they are, the more likely they are to be known by highly stable terms.

In contrast, it seems that unstable terms may be unstable for a variety of reasons. We have a number of instances where it has proved very difficult to make any well-supported reconstructions, and others where two or more reconstructions that differ only very slightly in form have been made for an insect. Examples are:

The existence of taboo to limit use of a particular form to a particular area, has already been suggested for ‘butterfly’ in [§3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3#cldf:4-7), and may explain why this creature can have a name that is very stable in most of the Oceanic region, yet be unstable in parts of Western Oceanic.

Clearly, onomatopoeia plays a role in the naming of the humming and buzzing insects, where there is frequent interchange of _n_, _ñ_ and _ŋ_. Examples include POc _&ast;ñamuk_, PWOc _&ast;ŋati-ŋati_, both ‘mosquito’,  POc _&ast;ŋiŋi(ŋ)_ (1) ‘buzz as a mosquito’, (2) ‘mosquito’, _&ast;(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)i_ ‘bee, buzzing insect’.

Irregular patterning of terms for insects has been attributed to the fact that many insects are ‘expressive’ creatures. That is, they are associated with particular characteristics that impinge strongly on the human sensory system and become a significant identifying feature for that insect. Characteristics include sound (crickets, cicadas, the buzzing insects), movement (grasshoppers, butterflies, spiders), ability to sting or bite (mosquitoes, sandflies and other stinging flies, centipedes, scorpions, ants) and possibly other aspects of appearance or behaviour. It has been claimed that it is their ‘expressive’ condition that underlies a tendency for speakers to play phonological games with their names, resulting in irregularities that may then defy reconstruction. This tendency has been observed cross-linguistically by Erik [Fudge](Source#cldf:Fudge1970) ([1970](Source#cldf:Fudge1970)) in words of certain semantic type including onomatopoeia or movement, and in the names of plants and animals in Balinese and the closely related Javanese by Adrian [Clynes](Source#cldf:Clynes1995) ([1995](Source#cldf:Clynes1995):44).


<a id="s-27"></a>

## 27. The supernatural element


Among my POc reconstructions, those carrying the _&ast;kali-_/_&ast;qali-_ prefix are limited to _&ast;[kali]-bobo(ŋ)_ ‘butterfly’, _&ast;qalipan_ ‘centipede’ and _&ast;qali-popot_/_&ast;(k,q)ali-totop_ ‘firefly’. Ethnographic evidence from a number of communities indicates that all three creatures retain some supernatural association requiring them to be treated with caution. I also have a number of reconstructions at POc level or lower which may carry the prefix or some trace of it. They include PPn _&ast;kalisi_ ‘cicada, cricket’, a number of ant terms possibly reflecting POc _&ast;kal(a,o)_, two lizard terms, PSOc _&ast;qala_ ‘green lizard, _Emoia_ sp.’, PEOc _&ast;kalis(i,u)_ ‘skink, k.o. lizard’ (see [ch.5, §5.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5-3-5#cldf:4-5)), and a number of terms for ‘spider’ which carry the prefix _ka-_.[^14] However, if my reconstructions do in fact carry a trace of the danger prefix, they have lost what was evidently an essential element of _&ast;kali-_/_&ast;qali-_ words at a stage earlier than POc, that is, conversion from the typical disyllabic base form to a quadrisyllable one. The prefix had ceased to be productive in POc.


<a id="p-420"></a>

Nonetheless, it seems that in Polynesian languages there is a different term which can be used to mark a creature as supernatural. PPn _&ast;qatua_ (from PMP _&ast;qatuari_), often glossed ‘god, deity’, is used primarily to signify that an object, whether human or non-human, has supernatural qualities. In Williams’ Maori dictionary, the definition of _atua_ runs ‘god, demon, supernatural being, ghost; object of superstitious regard; anything malign, disagreeable; strange, extraordinary’.[^15] Like _qali-_/_kali-_, its range in Polynesian languages extends to inexplicable phenomena such as rainbows and waterspouts.[^16]

Examples of its use in Polynesia include Maori _atua-piko_ ‘rainbow’ (cf PT: Kilivila _kali-pedoga_ ‘rainbow’), Tongan _ʔotua-kui_ ‘whirlwind, waterspout’ (cf MM: Nakanai _kali-vuru_ ‘tornado, waterspout’ and MM: Tolai _kali-vuvur_ ‘whirlwind’), and a small number of insect terms, Samoan _atua-loa_ ‘k.o. centipede with poisonous bite’ (cf POc _&ast;qali-pan_  ‘centipede’) Maori _pepe atua_ ‘northern wattle moth’ (literally ‘supernatural butterfly’) (cf. POc _&ast;[kali]bobo(ŋ)_ ‘butterfly’) and two Rennellese terms, _ʔatua segesege baʔe_ ‘a large grasshopper’ (lit. ‘leg-cutting supernatural’) and _ʔatua-seu_ ‘large stinging stick insect’ (lit. ‘lame supernatural’).

A detailed account of the way in which _atua_ is linked to natural species in one community is given by [Firth](Source#cldf:Firth1967) ([1967](Source#cldf:Firth1967):233). In Tikopia, as in other Polynesian communities, _atua_ applies primarily to a supernatural object, whether human or non-human in form. However, it is applied also to any natural species which should not be eaten. ‘The terms _atua_ and _kai_ (food) in this connection are in fact mutually exclusive. The [former] applies to small crabs, sea anemones, bêche-de-mer and other marine creatures on the reef, as well as to iridescent lizards, spiders and some insects.’ (p.233). He suggests ‘_that the connotation of _atua_ as inedible may be derivative from its significance of supernatural’ (p.234), (italics mine, MO). He concludes that  ‘one point, however, may be stressed with certainty, that any object which is regarded as an _atua_ may not be eaten, and anything which is fit for human consumption cannot be in itself an _atua_ — though it may … become temporarily associated with _atua_’ (p.234). Among the creatures he lists as _atua_ are two inedible crabs, _kaviki_ ‘small pale land crab’ and _karamisi_ ‘reddish-brown or yellowish crab, [which] lives in crotch of tree’ (cf PMP _&ast;qali-maŋaw_ ‘mangrove crab’). Also _atua_ are _moko_, the black lizard, and _morokau_, the centipede. In Tikopia, then, _atua_ is not affixed to the names of natural species as it is in other Polynesian communities and in the manner of _qali-_/_kali-_, but is rather the name of a category.

The association of certain insects with the supernatural has survived from PAn society right through to certain contemporary Polynesian societies. Although the _qali-_/_kali-_ label has evidently lost its force in Oceanic languages, the existence of reflexes of _&ast;qatuan_ in a similar capacity is a revealing linguistic clue to certain beliefs of POc speakers.

[^15]: As the breadth of the Maori definition illustrates, the result of the long association of supernatural qualities with certain creatures has led to its interpretation in a number of different ways, not all of them compatible with Blust’s ‘danger: avoid’ message for PMP _&ast;qali-_.

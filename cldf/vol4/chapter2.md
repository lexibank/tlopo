## 1. Introduction


Proto Oceanic speaking communities subsisted on what they could grow and gather and what they could glean from the reef and sea.[^1] Through their dependence on fishing, the inhabitants would have amassed knowledge of the environments favoured by particular fish, and awareness of fish habits as they related to such things as season of the year, the lunar and diurnal cycle, tidal movements, winds and currents. The times of certain fish to be fat, to be abundant, and to aggregate in a certain spot for spawning or feeding would have been marked.

This chapter deals mainly with the names of fishes. Paul [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994)) and Robin [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994)) have provided a substantial starting point with their work on reconstructing fish names for Proto Central Pacific and Proto Polynesian respectively. Their data and lower-level reconstructions are reproduced here when included in a higher level reconstruction. Otherwise I simply record the existence of a PCP or PPn reconstruction.

In most Oceanic languages the lexicon of fish names is the largest of all faunal fields. The lists of local fish names available to me include almost 300 items for Mbunai Titan in the Admiralties ([Akimichi & Sakiyama 1991](Source#cldf:AkimichiandSakiyama1991)), over 400 for both Marovo in the NW Solomons ([Hviding 1996](Source#cldf:Hviding1996)), and Wayan Fijian ([Pawley & Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)), 250 for Kapingamarangi in Polynesia ([Lieber 1994](Source#cldf:Lieber1994)) and around 400 for Satawalese in Micronesia ([Akimichi & Sauchomal 1982](Source#cldf:AkimichiandSauchomal1982)). The evidence is overwhelming that knowledge of fish is, or has been until the breakdown of traditional lifestyles, extremely detailed, and one not restricted to a small group of people, but widespread among the majority of Oceanic communities.


<a id="p-26"></a>

A preliminary question that arises is: Do varieties of fishes in the tropical Pacific diminish in number the further one moves east from the major land masses? From linguistic evidence alone it appears that the major families continue to be represented throughout the region, but the number of genera and species diminishes. The greatest number of families noted in a wordlist available to me is from one of the more remote locations.[^2]

[Davis’s](Source#cldf:Davis1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Davis1999)) listing for Chuuk records 71 of the 78 families included in my survey.[^3] [Leach & Davidson](Source#cldf:LeachandDavidson2000) ([2000](Source#cldf:LeachandDavidson2000)) have considered the question from an archaeological perspective. From fish remains identified from 24 different island groups in the tropical Pacific they list 48 families that were taken in any quantity by prehistoric people (p.414). Although they note signs of regional specialisation, they write that this ‘cannot be explained by changes in natural abundance of fish types from one place to another’ but is due rather to aspects of human behaviour (p.416). Thus it should be possible to reconstruct terms to at least the taxonomic level of family from the full range of linguistic subgroups including Micronesia and Polynesia, notwithstanding that the range of environment declines. This is in contrast to the land-based flora and fauna.

Although I have used western taxonomy as the basis of my classification, it should not be assumed that all Oceanic peoples used a similar system of organization. As an example, Edvard Hviding describes the system used by the people of the Marovo Lagoon, on the island of New Georgia, western Solomons. He writes:

> Marovo fish taxonomy has a structure that differs considerably from Linnaean or western scientific taxonomy. For instance, a number of Marovo fish taxa are highly general “lump” categories that cover a considerable number of Linnaean species under one name. The _temi kepe_ (etymology uncertain) covers, without further specification, all (in western terms) ‘butterflyfish’ and ‘coralfish’, as well as any number of similar small, colorful reef fish with high and flat bodies. On the other hand, one Linnaean species may be subdivided in Marovo into a great number of named subtypes. One example is the skipjack tuna or makasi, which in Marovo has more than a dozen specific names that refer to growth stages, colorings, and more. Important food species are often finely subdivided in such a manner, in three-to-four-level taxonomic structures, while insignificant fishes, such as the small reef species just mentioned, are more commonly “lumped”. This does not imply that Marovo fishers do not generally and readily distinguish between similar looking fish species. They have names for at least four hundred Marovo “species”, and experienced people can easily single out and identify by name closely related fishes that differ only very subtly in color or general appearance. For example, at least twelve types of medium-sized parrotfish (no generic term in Marovo) are classified and named, as well as more than seventeen ‘trevallies’ [Carangids: _mara_] and at least twenty ‘groupers’ [Serranids: _pajara_] ([Hviding 1996](Source#cldf:Hviding1996):192-193).


<a id="p-27"></a>

Primary lexemes can denote a fish at the species, the genus or the family level, and occasionally, as with sharks and rays, suborders or even orders. Particular species are more likely to be separately named if they are distinctive in appearance, like the bump-headed parrotfish, or valued food, like the great barracuda. At the species level or lower, names are more likely to be binomial. Some may be multimorphemic, reflecting attributes such as similarity of appearance, habit (schooling or not), environment (e.g. bottom-dwellers, pelagic, fresh-water, estuarine, reef or deep sea dwellers), whether diurnal or nocturnal, and nastiness (poisonous to eat, stingers). Distinctive appearance may be reflected, with terms for head, nose, eye, spikes, filaments, similarity to sail or palm leaf and so on being incorporated into the name. In Polynesian languages some colour terms, particularly reflexes of PPn _&ast;tea_ ‘white’, _&ast;quli_ ‘black’, _&ast;kefu_ ‘reddish-brown’, _&ast;kula_ ‘red’ and _&ast;mea_ ‘reddish’, are quite common. Wayan Fijian has _kati ni tanive_, lit. ‘biter of sardines’ for a medium sized trevally, after its feeding habits, while a scorpionfish whose poisonous spines can inflict severe pain is called _taŋitaŋi ga ua_, lit. ‘cry until high tide’. Niuean calls a species of parrotfish _mohe-aho_ lit. ‘sleep by day’. Valued fish and fish whose appearance changes with age will often have names for particular growth stages. In Tonga, for instance, a species of mullet (_Valamugil cunnesius_) has six named stages, ranging from smallest to largest, _teʔevela_, _teʔekona_, _teʔefō_, _ʔunomoa_, _kanahe_, and _kanahe fau_.

A common difficulty in reconstructing the semantic range of a term is that although apparent cognate names may exist in, say, the Admiralties, the Solomons and Polynesia, the fishes bearing these names may belong to different species or genera. While some species are widespread, others are highly restricted in their geographic range, and the name of a fish in the Admiralties may well be given elsewhere to another species within the same family, or to an unrelated fish that resembles it in some aspect. As well, the western scientific taxonomy of fishes is subject to continuing revision and occasional name replacement. These are problems both for the wordlist compiler in identifying a fish by its Linnaean classification in addition to its common name, and for ourselves in tracing the somewhat fluid species association that a cognate set may produce.


<a id="s-2"></a>

## 2. Organisation


The cognate sets that follow are grouped in terms of Linnaean families and high order groupings. The ordering of groups substantially follows that of Ian [Munro](Source#cldf:Munro1967) ([1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967)) in his encyclopaedic volume _The Fishes of New Guinea_. However, since then there have been numerous revisions to fish taxonomy. In particular, I have been guided by the FishBase website ([Froese & Pauly 2010](Source#cldf:FroeseandPauly2010)) in tracing synonyms and revised scientific classification. Dictionary identifications have been retained, with any revision of terminology added in square brackets.

For descriptions of fish appearance and behaviour I have also relied heavily on [Munro](Source#cldf:Munro1967) ([1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967)) and [Allen & Swainston](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993)).

Terms for fish parts are included in this chapter. Marine mammals have been included in chapter 5.


<a id="p-28"></a>


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Fish (generic)


It is likely that the POc term _&ast;ikan_ had both a narrow and a broad sense. The narrow sense applied to ‘typical’ fish, while the broad sense included some or all of the following: whales, dolphins, dugongs, eels, turtles, cephalopods and rays. Shellfish are generally excluded in daughter languages. See chapter 8 for a fuller discussion.

## 4. Sharks: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae etc


In this section and in [§5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-5#cldf:4-2) on rays, I am dealing with sub-orders rather than families. [Kailola](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991) ([1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991)) lists twelve shark families, the best-known probably being Carcharhinidae, the largest, with tiger sharks, black-tip and white-tip sharks among its species, and Sphyrnidae, hammerheads.

Most sharks inhabit shallow coastal waters around reefs. A number of species are regarded as dangerous, but in parts of the southeast Solomons sharks are thought to be the ghosts of men and are considered sacred. I have reconstructed one possible generic term, _&ast;bakewa_, its cognates widespread, but undergoing a change of meaning in Central Pacific. Reflexes of _&ast;maŋewa_ have replaced _&ast;bakewa_ as the generic term in Polynesia. In Motu and Fiji the reflex of a POc term for shark has come to be applied instead to the remora or sucker fish which attaches itself to sharks and other large sea creatures ([§65](ContributionTable?anchor=s-65#cldf:4-2)). This is the case with Motu _maɣoa_ and PCP _&ast;bakewa_. Tolai _gul_ can be used to refer to either a ‘k.o. striped shark (tiger shark?)’ or ‘the pilotfish _Naucrates ductor_’, a fish which also stays in the close vicinity of sharks.


<a id="p-30"></a>

<a id="fig-4-2_1"> </a>

[__Figure 2.1:__ _Carcharodon carcharias_, great white shark](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_1)



Proto Oceanic speakers undoubtedly distinguished many different species of sharks by name, as contemporary Oceanic speech communities do, but reconstructed terms have not been clearly identified with particular species at a level higher than Proto Central Pacific.

Cognates in the following set from the Admiralties, Papuan Tip, SE Solomons and Micronesia provide the strongest evidence for _&ast;bakewa_ as the generic term for ‘shark’ in POc.

[POc &ast;_bakewa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-4-None-30-POc-bakewa-a)


<a id="p-31"></a>

In Polynesian languages, reflexes of PPn _&ast;pakewa_ usually refer to a trevally (belonging to the same family as _Naucrates ductor_, the pilot fish), while reflexes of PPn _&ast;maŋō_ are the generic term for shark.

The next reconstruction, POc _&ast;maŋewa_ ‘shark’, appears to be a variant of _&ast;bakewa_ in which the stops are replaced by nasals. It is impossible to know how such a variant might have arisen, but the probability of two formally parallel homonymous trisyllables arising by chance is extremely low ([Nichols 1996](Source#cldf:Nichols1996):50-51).

The reconstruction _&ast;maŋewa_ assumes that segment coalescence has occurred in both Motu and the SES languages. Motu _maɣoa_ reflects coalescence of _&ast;-ew-_ as _-o-_, SES _maŋeo_ coalescence of _&ast;-wa_ as _-o_. Note that a similar change occurred in NCV and Micronesian reflexes of _&ast;bakewa_.

[POc &ast;_maŋewa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-4-None-31-POc-maewa-a)


<a id="p-32"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;kʷarawa_ serve as a generic term in parts of WOc, but in Polynesia refer to specific species.

[POc &ast;_kʷarawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-4-None-32-POc-karawa-a)

Geraghty (p. 143) also lists PCP _&ast;qaso_ ‘k.o. large shark, _Carcharhinus_ sp.’ If the Taiof and Halia terms below are cognate, then POc _&ast;kaso(r,R)_ is reconstructable.

[PCP &ast;_qaso_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-4-None-32-PCP-qaso-a)


<a id="p-33"></a>

Languages frequently use binomial terms to refer to particular shark species, although sometimes the generic first element is regarded as optional. Fijian (unspecified) uses _gio_[^4] + modifier, e.g, _gio uvi_ ‘_Carcharhinus plumbeus_, sandbar shark’, _gio daniva_ ‘_Galeo cerdo_, tiger shark’, _gio uluvai_ ‘hammerhead shark’ (Geraghty pers. comm.). Modifiers tend to develop independently in different languages, although elements recur. Two of the Fijian modifiers, _uvi_ and _daniva_, are found also in Polynesian terms, PPn _&ast;nai-ufi_ ‘k.o. large shark, probably tiger or grey reef shark’ and PPn _&ast;tanifa_ ‘tiger shark’. The latter is remarkably a reflex of POc _&ast;tanipa_ ‘sardine’ ([§7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-7#cldf:4-2)), presumably because of similar iridescent zigzag vertical lines on both tiger sharks and sardines ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p. 143).

Probably because of similar wavy iridescent lines on the sides of Spanish mackerel, also a large predatory fish, reflexes of POc _&ast;taŋiRi_ ‘Spanish mackerel’ ([§57](ContributionTable?anchor=s-57#cldf:4-2)) have been incorporated into names for a kind of shark in Muyuw (PT) and Marovo (MM).

[4-2-4-None-33-pt-muyuw-tagiligal](cf.csv#cldf:4-2-4-None-33-pt-muyuw-tagiligal)

An obviously descriptive name, PCP _&ast;mata qi taliŋa_ ‘eyes of ears’ is used in Central Pacific languages to refer to the hammerhead shark, although the term has been lost in Eastern Polynesian. In Molima (PT), this shark is referred to as _mala balabala_, literally ‘eyes crosswise’, while in Gela (SES) it is _baɣea papala vohe_ ‘paddle-handle shark’.


<a id="p-34"></a>


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Rays: stingrays (Dasyatidae), eagle rays (Myliobatidae), manta rays (Mobulidae)


Stingrays and eagle rays inhabit sandy bottoms in the vicinity of coral reefs, and are common in estuaries where there is abundant mud. Eagle rays are so named because of their wide flaps and ability to leap from the water. Manta rays rank among the largest known fishes. They are specialised in having largely abandoned the bottom-living habit and usually swim near the surface, often leaping from the water. Manta rays inhabit open ocean, and are seldom seen near shore.

<a id="fig-4-2_2"> </a>

[__Figure 2.2:__ _Aetobatus narinari_, spotted eagle ray](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_2)



Reflexes of POc _&ast;paRi_ are numerous and widespread. It seems that the POc term had both a generic and a specific sense. Although most of the reflexes listed below are glossed ‘stingray’, _&ast;paRi_ is used as the first element in compound terms for rays other than stingrays (see _&ast;paRi-manuk_ below). The same pattern occurs in Marovo (NW Solomonic) where _tape_ is the term both for stingrays and other rays in general, giving rise to compounds like _tape kurukuru_ ‘spotted eagle ray, _Aetobatus narinari_`.

Oceanic languages usually distinguish several taxa, typically binomials, _&ast;paRi_ + modifier.

[PAn &ast;_paRiS_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-5-None-34-POc-pari-a)


<a id="p-35"></a>

[PMP &ast;_paRih manuk_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-5-None-35-POc-parimanuk-a)


<a id="p-36"></a>

Banks Islands languages (North Vanuatu) support Proto Banks _&ast;vaRi mala_ ‘eagle ray’, where the term for ‘hawk’ rather than ‘bird’ is the modifier (Alexandre François, pers. comm.).

Reflexes of POc _&ast;Ropok_ ‘to fly’ are sometimes used in compounds to distinguish rays that leap from the water. Examples are Nakanai (MM) _kova lovo-lovo_ ‘ray with two wings’ (_kova_ ‘stingray’) and Gela (SES) _vali-lovo_ ‘eagle ray, manta ray, devil ray’.

Lower level reconstructions include PCP &ast;_vai bekʷa_, PPn _fai peka_ ‘_Aetobatus narinari_, spotted eagle ray’ (PCP _&ast;bekʷa_ ‘bat’) ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p. 144); PPn _fai kili_ ‘sandpaper ray’ (probably Himantura granulata, Dasyatidae) (_&ast;kili_ ‘file’); and PNPn _fāfā-lua_ ‘_Manta birostris_. manta ray’ (lit. ‘full of holes’, presumably a description of the pitted appearance of the skin), the latter two from [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p. 197).


<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Bonefishes (Albulidae) and tarpons (Elopidae, formerly Megalopidae)


Bonefishes are coastal fishes, moderately sized and brilliantly silver, which often congregate in large schools. They are generally valued as food, but have many fine bones. Tarpons are also moderately large coastal game fishes which ascend rivers in search of food. The flesh is tough, with numerous fine bones. They are renowned as active strong fighters capable of swift movement, leaping ability and great endurance ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.41).

The two families are treated together because the second reconstruction below, POc _&ast;pu-pulan_, is based on cognates referring to both and seems a broader term than POc _&ast;kuRo_, bonefishes and tarpons are similar in colour and habitat, and both are marked by the presence of many fine bones.

[PMP &ast;_kuRaw_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-6-None-36-POc-kuro-a)

[PMP &ast;_bulan-bulan_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-6-None-37-POc-pupulan-a)


<a id="s-7"></a>

## 7. Sardines and herrings (Clupeidae) and anchovies (Engraulidae)


<a id="fig-4-2_3"> </a>

[__Figure 2.3:__ _Spratelloides delicatulus_, small round herring](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_3)



Sardines and herrings are small migratory fishes which congregate in enormous shoals in shallow coastal waters. Flesh is oily but tasty ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.50). They are taken in nets in Oceanic communities.

Anchovies also live in large schools in coastal waters and estuaries. They have a long slender maxillary (upper jaw) and protruding snout, and most are silvery or have a bright silvery lateral band. Some species migrate seasonally, and the schools come close inshore where they can be captured with seines ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.43).


<a id="p-38"></a>

In the cognate sets which follow, terms show some crossover of meaning between sardines and anchovies. This is most likely due to looseness of definition of the English terms by the wordlist compilers, but it is possible that the two families are regarded as sufficiently similar in some languages for one term to cover both. The fact that we can reconstruct six POc terms indicates that speakers differentiated between the referents in some regard.

[PMP &ast;_paya_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-7-None-38-POc-paya-a)

[POc &ast;_jaja_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-7-None-38-POc-jaja-a)

In the next cognate set, there is reasonable consistency of meaning as far east as Fiji, but Polynesian reflexes undergo a striking change of meaning, referring to a kind of shark with similar markings to sardines (see p.33). Polynesian terms for sardine, together with a number of Fijian terms, have the same form minus the first syllable.

<a id="s-8"></a>

## 8. Milkfishes (Chanidae)


This family consists of a single species, _Chanos chanos_. Fishes grow to around a metre in length, are finely scaled, silvery and toothless. They inhabit both open sea and brackish water and can ascend into rivers. They feed on crustaceans, worms and detritus. Although very bony, the flesh has soft texture and excellent flavour ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.54).


<a id="p-41"></a>

There is a well-supported POc reconstruction continuing PMP _&ast;qawa_ or _&ast;qawan_. New Caledonian reflexes provide support for final _&ast;-q_. At least two SES cognates show confusion with terms for mullet (cf. POc _&ast;(k,q)aRua(s)_, [§18](ContributionTable?anchor=s-18#cldf:4-2)).

[PMP &ast;_qawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-8-None-41-POc-qawaq-a)


<a id="s-9"></a>

## 9. Lizardfishes (Synodontidae)


Lizardfish are small, slender and cylindrical, with a rather wide mouth. Most are bottomliving inhabitants of muddy or sandy areas of shallow coastal waters. They are barred and mottled to blend in with bottom surroundings, and their general appearance suggests that of a lizard. The flesh is not very bony but insipid ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.70).

The only reconstruction made for this family is PCP _&ast;dolo_, PPn _&ast;tolo_ ‘Sanrida, lizardfish’ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.146). These may reflect POc _&ast;(t,d)oloq_ ‘eel’ ([§11.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-11-3#cldf:4-2)), with semantic shift.

[__Figure 2.4:__ _Plotosus lineatus_, striped eel catfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_4)




<a id="s-10"></a>

## 10. Catfish (Plotosidae)


Catfish are recognizable by thick slimy naked skin and long head feelers which resemble a cat’s whiskers. They are edible, with excellent flesh despite their appearance. Munro (1994: p.74) describes most New Guinea species as estuarine, although some frequent fresh water, while Geraghty (pers. comm.) notes that in Fiji and probably Polynesia catfish are found only in salt water. They are carnivorous bottom feeders, swallowing anything in their way. _Plotosus anguillaris_ is a synonym for _Plotosus lineatus_.

Reflexes undergo a change of meaning in some Polynesian languages. [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.221) suggests that an elongate shape may provide the semantic link with snake mackerels, and, although the two are found in very different environments, both are black and slimy (Geraghty pers. comm.).

[POc &ast;_kaboRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-10-None-42-POc-kabora-a)

Geraghty (pers. comm.) notes that juvenile catfish do move in very dense populous swarms.


<a id="p-43"></a>


<a id="s-11"></a>

## 11. Eels


Eels are classified in a number of families within the Order _Anguilliformes_. The best known within the region are the freshwater eels (Anguillidae), and several sea eel families including morays (Muraenidae), pike eels (Muraenesocidae), congers (Congridae) and snake eels (Ophichthidae).


<a id="s-11-1"></a>

### 11.1. Freshwater eels (Anguillidae)


Although they spend most of their lives in fresh water, freshwater eels migrate to sea to spawn. In inland areas they constitute an important food item. POc _&ast;tuna_ is well supported as the generic term for all freshwater eels.

[PAn &ast;_tuNa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-11-1-43-POc-tuna-a)


<a id="p-44"></a>


<a id="s-11-2"></a>

### 11.2. Morays (Muraenidae)


Morays are large, thick-skinned eels with sharp knife-like teeth but no pectoral fins. They can be pugnacious when confronted, although shy by nature. Many are nocturnal. They are often found in the crevices of coral banks. There are numerous species in New Guinea waters, many quite distinctive in colouring and markings.

POc _&ast;[la]bʷa(s,j)i_ ‘moray eel’ is reconstructable both with and without initial _&ast;la-_.

[POc &ast;_&#91;la&#93;bʷa(s,j)i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-11-2-44-POc-labasji-a)

[PPn &ast;_pusi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-11-2-44-PPn-pusi-a)

The reconstruction below is weakly supported and it is uncertain what kind of eel it referred to. It is listed in this section as its Titan reflex refers to a kind of moray.

The Micronesian evidence below points to a reconstruction with a single final vowel, while the PCP evidence reflects two.

[PROc &ast;_dābea_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-11-2-45-PROc-dabea-a)

Lower-level reconstructions include PCP _&ast;boila_ ‘moray eel’ and _&ast;dravua_ ‘_Gymnothorax_ sp.’ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.145).


<a id="s-11-3"></a>

### 11.3. Pike eels (Muraenesocidae) and congers (Congridae)


Pike eels are large, with prominent canine teeth and a long slender snout. Conger eels are also large, with well-developed vertical and pectoral fins. The two are sometimes classified together. The flesh of both is excellent. Both occur in shallow water, although congers also have deep-water forms.

<a id="s-11-4"></a>

### 11.4. Snake eels (Ophichthidae)


Snake eels tend to lie on sandy or muddy bottoms in the vicinity of reefs, often spending daylight hours completely buried, although they can swim to the surface at night when attracted by lights. They are difficult to trap, seldom taking a hook, while their slender bodies pass through the mesh of nets and traps ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.91). No reconstructions have been made.


<a id="s-11-5"></a>

### 11.5. Other terms for eels


In a number of reconstructions it has proved difficult to link terms to particular kinds of eel. The following may be a generic term for sea eels.

[POc &ast;_malayo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-11-5-46-POc-malayo-a)

Mota has two similar terms, _maleo_ and _marea_, and it is possible that the former is a borrowing from a Western Oceanic language. The next set is in complementary distribution to the one above, and it may be that we are dealing with a single cognate set, although we would expect PROc †_&ast;malaya_ if directly inherited. It is possible that PROc _&ast;maraya_ was borrowed from an unrecorded language’s reflex of POc _&ast;malayo_. Arosi (SES) _marea_ ‘k.o. eel’ also appears to reflect _&ast;maraya_, but it is reasonably likely that this is a Mota borrowing introduced by missionaries, as Mota was a missionary lingua franca which was also used in parts of the Solomon Islands in the nineteenth century.

The Polynesian terms may be linked through association with PPn _&ast;tolo_ ‘to crawl’. Some eels (particularly snake eels), lizardfish ([§9](ContributionTable?anchor=s-9#cldf:4-2)) and mud skippers ([§49](ContributionTable?anchor=s-49#cldf:4-2)) may all be described as mud dwellers.

The SES terms below show coalescence of _&ast;wa_ as _-o_ as has been noted also in some shark terms.

## 12. Flying fishes (Exocoetidae)


<a id="fig-4-2_7"> </a>

[__Figure 2.7:__ _Exocoetus volitans_, blue flying fish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_7)



These fish are pelagic, swimming near the surface and gliding above the water for considerable distances. They inhabit open coastal and oceanic waters, are attracted to light at night and often leap aboard vessels. Their flesh is of good quality ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 115). In Sa’a (Malaita), flying fish, like the bonito, require a certain supernatural power to be caught. Certain formalities must be followed and particular sacrifices made before a canoe can set out to catch flying fish ([Codrington 1891](Source#cldf:Codrington1891):138).

Munro identifies more than a dozen species, but terms located have little elaboration of identity.

PPn _&ast;sipa_ ‘small or immature flying fish’ is considered to be a reflex of POc _&ast;sipa_ ‘Hemiramphidae’, proposed in [§13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-13#cldf:4-2).


<a id="s-13"></a>

## 13. Half beaks and garfishes (Hemiramphidae), needlefishes and long toms (Belonidae)


Adult halfbeaks and garfishes have an elongated shaft-like lower jaw and very short upper jaw, although in juveniles the mouth is symmetrical. Like needlefish they live near the surface and are semipelagic. They inhabit shallow water and estuaries. The flesh is delicate but full of fine bones. They are important food fishes ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 109). _Hemiramphus_ is the most common genus.

Needlefish and long toms are very slender, elongated with forceps-like jaws, well-toothed with minute scales. They are both marine and estuarine, and a few live permanently in fresh water. They often congregate in schools. Generally voracious, they are potentially dangerous because of their great speed and habit of making sudden leaps, especially when attracted to lights at night. The flesh is excellent ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 105). Genera include _Belone_, _Platybelone_, _Strongylura_ and _Tylosurus_.

The two families are here treated together because in a number of languages (Halia, Kiribati, Mokilese, Rennellese, Samoan, Tikopia) there is one term covering both, presumably reflecting similarities in shape and habitat.

[POc &ast;_Rije_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-13-None-49-POc-rije-a)

The change in gloss in PPn below can be explained because of close resemblance between garfishes and some flying fish, with the latter, such as the beaked flying fish, _Oxyporhamphus micropterus micropterus_, classified as Exocoetidae by Munro (p. 118) and more recently as Hemiramphidae ([Kailola 1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991):153, FishBase). Half beaks, garfish and flying fish all belong to the same suborder.

Reduplicated reflexes of POc _&ast;sao_ in PPn below, refer instead to _Sphyraena_, the barracuda, and possibly its juvenile form. There is evidently some crossover of meaning between PPn _&ast;sao-sao_ ‘_Sphyraena_ sp.’ and PPn _&ast;tao-tao_ ‘_Fistularia_ spp., probably including trumpetfish’ (see [§15](ContributionTable?anchor=s-15#cldf:4-2)). This may be because both barracuda and trumpetfish are, like the needlefish and garfish, long narrow fish, spear-like in shape.

## 14. Squirrelfishes, soldierfishes (Holocentridae)


This family is well-represented through the region by most of the approximately 70 species known worldwide. Most are brilliant red, armoured with large rough scales with jagged edges. The head is extremely rough and spiny. They have large eyes, and are often longitudinally banded. Many species are nocturnal, living in holes in the reef during the day ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 138). Although most of the species are small, the flesh is considered good eating. In Niuatoputapu they are caught on moonlit nights either from a boat anchored near the reef or while standing on the reef edge ([Dye 1983](Source#cldf:Dye1983):250). Genera include _Sargocentron_ [Holocentrus], _Myripristis_ and _Flammeo_. _Adioryx_ is now classified as a junior synonym of _Sargocentron_.

A number of taxa are typically distinguished in Oceanic languages. Three POc terms are reconstructable. Nuclear Micronesian reflexes in the following reconstruction confirm that this form was trisyllabic, as an original disyllable would be reflected without final vowel (ACD).

<a id="s-15"></a>

## 15. Trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae), cometfishes and flutemouths (Fistulariidae)


Trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae) have a long compressed body, long head and small mouth at the end of a long compressed snout. Colours change from green through orange to reddish-brown in harmony with surroundings. They are rather small, shallow-water fishes, frequently observed resting motionless on the bottom ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.149). The family is widely distributed ([Fowler 1928](Source#cldf:Fowler1928):6).


<a id="p-56"></a>

<a id="fig-4-2_11"> </a>

[__Figure 2.11:__ _Fistularia commersonii_, smooth flutemouth](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_11)



Cornetfishes somewhat resemble long toms, but are readily distinguished by long flutelike snouts and whiplash-like filamentous prolongation of middle caudal (tail) fin rays ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.149).

A lower-level reconstruction is PCP _&ast;baba_ ‘_Fistularia_, flutemouth’ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.148). [Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) (p.200) offers PPn _&ast;tao-tao_ ‘_Fistularia_ sp., flutefish’, which no doubt reflects the fish’s spearlike form (PPn _&ast;tao_ ‘spear’).


<a id="s-16"></a>

## 16. Pipefishes, seahorses (Syngnathidae)


Most pipefishes (Syngnathidae) are long and thin, with a body covered in bony plates. Though poor swimmers and very sluggish, many are widely distributed by currents. Jointed bony armour of both species prevents active swimming. Fins are of little use and have degenerated ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 151).

The seahorse probably did not hold much interest for early Oceanic speakers, being neither economically useful nor dangerous. Collected terms for it are rare, as evidenced by responses to a request from Bruce Biggs on the an-lang e-mail list in 1999.[^10] However, a common element is apparent from NNG, MM and SES terms, reinforced by a term from Yamdena (CMP), _bwa-watan_ ‘seahorse’ (_bwaye_ ‘crocodile’) which permits reliable reconstruction of the word for crocodile as the first element in an otherwise variable compound.

[__Figure 2.12:__ _Mugil cephalus_, flathead grey mullet](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_12)



Kove (NNG) uses the same comparison, albeit with a non-cognate term for ‘crocodile’, _baɣele ele ɑto_ ‘seahorse, pipefish’ (bayele ‘crocodile’, _ele_ 'its',_ato_ ‘messenger’) (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.[^11]). In Dobu (PT) the term for crocodile is _warigoa_, and that for seahorse or pipefish _wari-warigoa_, reduplication of the first two syllables being a common way of indicating an inferior or diminutive form of the named item ([Ross 2005b](Source#cldf:Ross2005b): 199).


<a id="s-17"></a>

## 17. Razorfishes (Centriscidae)


Razorfish are small, extraordinarily modified fishes which are extremely flattened and practically transparent. They swim in small schools, each in a vertical position with head downward among branching corals or sea urchins ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 148). The name in Gela for _Aeoliscus strigatus_, razorfish is _iya tuyuru_, literally ‘standing fish’. They also ‘sleep’ under the sand and will disappear under the sand when threatened by predators ([Allen & Swainston 1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993):82). No reconstructions have been made.


<a id="s-18"></a>

## 18. Mullets (Mugilidae)


Some mullet species are extremely abundant, occurring in large schools in coastal waters and estuaries. At least one species resides permanently in fresh water. The fish usually swim near the surface and congregate among grass-like plants on tidal flats. They are readily taken in hauling seines, although many possess great leaping powers and escape. The flesh is tasty and rich, with few bones ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 164).

Although there are two soundly based reconstructions going back to PMP level, and one or two other more questionable POc reconstructions, I have very few cognates from Western Oceanic. POc _&ast;kanase_ is widely supported, and evidently refers to the best-known species,


<a id="p-58"></a>

_Valamugil cunnesius_, (formerly _Liza cephalus_ or _Mugil cephalus_]. POc _&ast;kaRapa_ is reconstructable, but as a term for _Liza vaigiensis_ is reliable only for Eastern Oceanic. Reflexes of POc _&ast;(k,q)aRua(s)_ refer to a range of mullet species, with size/growth stage possibly relevant.

Named growth stages of _Valamugil cunnesius_ are listed from Dobu (PT) and three Polynesian languages. They run from from smallest to largest.

Although the following set of forms points to POc _&ast;kaRapa_, the reference is consistent only for Remote Oceanic cognates. There is a single putative Western Oceanic reflex which refers to the mandarin fish (_Synchiropus splendidus_), a distinctive, brilliantly coloured but little-known fish, not more than 10 cm in length, and very dissimilar to mullets.

John Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests that a number of New Caledonian reflexes, Fwai, Nemi, Jawe _thiāp_ ‘mangrove mullet’, may be related, thus indicating PROc _&ast;jeqevo(o,u)_.

[Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) (p.204) reconstructs PPn _&ast;fua-fua_ ‘juvenile mullet’. With the addition of Wayan Fijian _vua-vua_ ‘small reef fish, 2-3 cm’ this reconstruction can be raised to PCP _&ast;vua-vua_ ‘k.o. small fish’.

## 19. Silversides, hardyheads (Atherinidae)


These are small silvery fishes occurring in large schools in shallow coastal waters and estuaries where they can be netted. Munro (p. 171) lists a dozen or so species and describes them as useful for bait. They are similar to sardines in appearance and behaviour.

## 20. Barracudas, sea-pikes (Sphyraenidae)


Barracudas are fast-swimming, carnivorous, pike-like fish, elongated and slender, which slash their prey with sharp dog-like teeth. Larger ones are regarded as dangerous because they have been known to attack humans. Munro calls them good fighters. They have firm delicate flavoured flesh and are a valuable food fish. They are normally caught by trolling. Larger species occur in coastal waters over shoals and around reefs ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.161).

Growth stages of _Sphyraena barracuda_[^12] and _Sphyraena forsteri_ in Lau (SES) are _ono_, _mamal-ito_, _ili_ ([Akimichi 1978](Source#cldf:Akimichi1978):308). [Dye](Source#cldf:Dye1983) ([1983](Source#cldf:Dye1983):261) lists four growth stages for barracuda in the Niuatoputapu dialect of Tongan: _tupuŋa-ʔono_, _momoto_, _hapatū_, _ʔono_.

Five POc terms are reconstructable, with _&ast;qonos_ possibly the generic. Final _&ast;-s_ is indicated by Nehan and the two Te Motu reflexes. Other reconstructions refer either to a particular species or to particular growth stages.

[POc &ast;_malisa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-20-None-62-POc-malisa-a)

The cognate set below points to a four-syllable reconstruction _&ast;bʷara-wa(r,d,dr,R)a(q)_ As the parentheses indicate, the reflexes do not agree as to the identity of the second liquid. Admiralties and Papuan Tip languages reflect _&ast;d_ or _&ast;dr_, Southeast Solomonic languages and Pije (New Caledonia) reflect _&ast;r_, and Tikopia (Polynesian) reflects _&ast;R_. However, it is so unlikely that this set of forms is the result of chance that we must infer that borrowing has taken place at some point. We also note that the Papuan Tip terms are glossed ‘moray eel’.


<a id="p-63"></a>

John Lynch (pers. comm.) points out that a four-syllable reconstruction is likely to be bimorphemic, i.e. _&ast;bʷara-wa(r,d,dr,R)a(q)_, and cites New Caledonian evidence in support of this. Nelemwa _bʷara-gom_ ‘moray eel’ seems to reflect the first morpheme, and Fwai _walagan_ ‘barracuda’ perhaps contains the second.

[POc &ast;_bʷara-wa(r,d,dr,R)a(q)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-20-None-63-POc-barawarddrraq-a)

The next reconstruction, POc _&ast;qutur_, shares the same form as a reconstruction for a very dissimilar fish, the jobfish, the latter reconstructable to PMP level (see [§30](ContributionTable?anchor=s-30#cldf:4-2)). A competing gloss, ‘_Sphyraena_ sp., barracuda’, is based on cognates from PT, NCV and Pn. These two etyma appear to be homonyms rather than cognates. Niuean retains a reflex of both etyma. PPT _&ast;qudur_, rather than †_&ast;qutur_, is reconstructable for both jobfish and barracuda.

[POc &ast;_qutur_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-20-None-63-POc-qutur-a)

[Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.203) identifies PPn _&ast;sao-sao_ as a growth stage for juvenile barracuda (see also [§13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-13#cldf:4-2), p.52). As both Wayan and Niuatoputapu distinguish three stages of growth, another growth stage can be identified as PCP _&ast;moto-moto_.

## 21. Sand basses, giant perches, barramundis (Centropomidae (Munro: Latidae))


These fish inhabit coastal waters, often penetrating into fresh water. They are noted for brilliant glassy eyes which glow at night. Although we have an apparent POc reconstruction, _&ast;mata-pula_, lit ‘eyes’ + ‘shine’ ([§24](ContributionTable?anchor=s-24#cldf:4-2)), the most consistent references of its reflexes are to _Priacanthus cruentatus_ [now _Heteropriacanthus cruentatus_], ‘red globe-eye’ in Polynesian languages. The single non-Polynesian reflex, Kove (NNG) _matapula_ ‘large freshwater fish’, may refer to Centropomidae.


<a id="s-22"></a>

## 22. Rock cods, reef cods, coral cods, groupers etc. (Serranidae)


These fish inhabit shallow coastal waters and estuaries, and are especially abundant around coral reefs and shoals. Many are brilliantly coloured in shades of red to brown, some with distinctive patterns. Nearly all are excellent eating. They are carnivorous and voracious, and one species, _Epinephelus lanceolatus_, the Queensland grouper, which can grow to three metres in length and up to 400 kg in weight, can be dangerous to divers ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.264). Most, however, are under a metre in length. Genera include _Epinephelus_, _Cephalopholis_ and _Plectropomus_, each with dozens of species. Oceanic languages typically distinguish many taxa.

Six POc reconstructions are supported. _&ast;kuRapu_ seems reliably to refer to the most distinctive member of the family, _Epinephelus lanceolatus_. Distinguishing the meanings of the other five reconstructions has proved difficult. The lack of conformity in glosses may be due to the possibility that the terms they represent are generic for particular groupings, with wordlists naming only the most familiar members of the set.

[POc &ast;_don(o,u)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-22-None-66-POc-donou-a)

The gloss of ‘rock cod, grouper’ for the following reconstruction is based on reflexes from Dobu (PT) and Fiji. In Gitua, Arosi, Woleaian and Hawaiian, apparent reflexes refer to trevally, blenny, parrotfish or wrasse, while elsewhere in Polynesia they refer to the crescent perch, _Terapon jarbua_ ([§35](ContributionTable?anchor=s-35#cldf:4-2)). Such fish have little in common, and the similarity of name may be coincidental.

## 23. Flagtails (Kuhliidae)


[Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967) (p.254) describes Kuhliidae as small to moderate-sized fishes, generally inhabiting shallow coastal waters, with some species preferring brackish or fresh water, often in the vicinity of mangroves. Salt-water species are a brilliant silver. Our only reconstructions are lower-level: PCP _&ast;sere_, PPn _&ast;sesele_ ‘immature Kuhlia rupestris’, PCP _&ast;drava_ ‘k.o. small freshwater fish, possibly _Kuhlia_ sp.’ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.150) and PPn _&ast;safole_ ‘_Kuhlia_ spp., flagtail’ ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.206).


<a id="s-24"></a>

## 24. Bigeyes, bullseyes (Priacanthidae)


These are small to moderate-sized fishes of distinctive appearance. All are bright rosy with a rough sandpapery skin. The eye is large, about half head size. They are nocturnal, typically spending daylight in caves or under ledges ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.284).

<a id="fig-4-2_14"> </a>

[__Figure 2.14:__ _Epinephelus lanceolatus_, Queensland grouper](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_14)



The PPn term, _&ast;mata-pula_ ‘_Priacanthus cruentatus_, red globe-eye’ is a descriptive compound (lit. _mata_ ‘eye’ + _pula_ ‘shine, glow’) ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.202). The same compound is found in Kove (NNG), where the referent is a large freshwater fish, probably Centropomidae ([§21](ContributionTable?anchor=s-21#cldf:4-2)).


<a id="s-25"></a>

## 25. Cardinalfishes (Apogonidae)


Cardinalfish are small carnivorous fishes. Many are vividly coloured, with striking patterns of bands, stripes or spots. Most live in or around coral reefs and amongst weeds, and in shallow tidal pools, although some prefer brackish water and others inhabit deeper water. Like the Priacanthidae, they are nocturnal, hiding under ledges or in crevices during daylight. The male usually carries the eggs and newly hatched young in its mouth ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.241). No reconstructions have been made.


<a id="s-26"></a>

## 26. Jacks, trevallies, scads, horse mackerels, kingfishes, darts, rainbow runners and leatherskins (Carangidae)


This is a large, widely distributed family of fast-swimming surface predators which generally inhabit the coastal edge of the deep water. Larger species frequent edges of reefs. Most congregate in schools, and can be caught along beaches with seines. Their flesh is of good texture and flavour ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.221). Oceanic languages typically distinguish many taxa.

In Niuatoputapu, deep sea anglers take pride in withstanding the rigours of a dusk to dawn session of _lauʔotule_, fishing from an anchored boat in around 17 fathoms of water, and using a pressure gas lamp to attract the fish (big-eyed scad, _Selar crumenophthalmus_) ([Dye 1983](Source#cldf:Dye1983):250).

I have six POc reconstructions, but can be confident of matching terms with specific genera for only four, POc _&ast;qatule_ ‘Selar spp., scad’, POc _&ast;pilu_ ‘Caranx spp., trevally’, POc _&ast;lasi_ ‘_Scomberoides_ spp., leatherskin’ and POc _&ast;kamaRi_ ‘_Elagatis bipinnulata_, rainbow runner’. Other genera include _Carangoides_, _Trachinotus_, _Gnathanodon_, and _Decapterus_. Where the reflexes cover a range of genera, the reconstructions are simply labelled carangid. The popularity of these fish both as sporting fish and as food, and their role in places as appropriate tribute for chiefs, are reflected by the number of terms for their growth stages. Here I can reconstruct PPn terms for growth stages, _&ast;lupo-lupo_ for the smallest and _&ast;qulua_ for a large caranx, (not necessarily the largest).

Oceanic reflexes of the next set refer fairly consistently to _Scomberoides_ spp. (=Chorinemus), fishes known variously as leatherskin, whitefish, queenfish, skinnyfish or giant dart. They can grow to over a metre in length. Blust (ACD) has reconstructed PMP _&ast;lajih_ ‘dolphinfish’ and PMP _&ast;daRi_ ‘leatherskin’, with Oceanic reflexes of the former apparently referring to the leatherskin. The two Mutu (NNG) terms below suggest that the dolphinfish may sometimes be referred to as the leatherskin’s mother. For dolphinfish sets, see [§27](ContributionTable?anchor=s-27#cldf:4-2) below.

Malcolm Ross ([vol.2,49](ContributionTable?anchor=p-49#cldf:2-3)-50) reconstructs POc _&ast;mala_ ‘resembling’ which occurs in plant names and occasionally, it seems, in fish names as well. Of the terms listed in the set below, those consisting of a compound _mala_ + modifier could all be considered ‘resembling’ examples. If this is the common meaning of _&ast;mala_ we would expect it to be reflected in terms for fishes not necessarily related.[^18] The fact that the most frequent reference in this set is to carangids suggests that a similar form was a POc fish name. However, because the carangid examples are largely restricted to the Solomons (the only exception being Samoan), it may be that _&ast;mala_ came to be used in the Solomons as a generic for carangids, as Hviding has suggested for Marovo. For this reason no POc reconstruction is proposed.

## 27. Dolphinfishes (Coryphaenidae)


<a id="fig-4-2_16"> </a>

[__Figure 2.16:__ _Coryphaena hippurus_, common dolphinfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_16)



Dolphinfish are large swift-swimming powerful fish, pelagic and mostly oceanic, but sometimes found around reefs. They are spectacular fighters which leap from the water when hooked. They have brilliant colouration and excellent flesh. [Munro](Source#cldf:Munro1967) ([1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): pp.218-219) records two species for the family, with _Coryphaena hippurus_ being larger and better known than _Coryphaena equiselis_. They are not to be confused with dolphins, cetaceans of the family Delphinidae, although some Polynesian dictionaries gloss their term for _Coryphaena hippurus_ as ‘dolphin’.

[PMP &ast;_palata_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-27-None-73-POc-palata-a)

[Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) (p.210) reconstructs PPn _&ast;masi-masi_ ‘_Coryphaena hippurus_, dolphinfish’, but we have found no non-Polynesian cognates.


<a id="p-74"></a>


<a id="s-28"></a>

## 28. Ponyfishes, slimys (Leiognathidae)


Ponyfishes are all very small, with a highly protractile mouth, the feature which is reflected in an alternative name, pouters. Slime is exuded in large quantities after capture. Large schools can be caught along sheltered beaches and estuaries ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967), p.237). In Lau (Malaita) they are freshwater fish, moving between the rivers and the lagoon ([Akimichi 1978](Source#cldf:Akimichi1978):310). Few terms have been located and no reconstructions made.


<a id="s-29"></a>

## 29. Fusiliers (Caesionidae)


Most fusiliers are brilliantly coloured with iridescent blue and yellow. They can be taken in great abundance near coral reefs and rocky shores. Very large schools migrate for long distances. They swim with synchronised quick precision. Flesh is coarse but not unpalatable ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.300). Hooper quotes Lewis et al. as describing them as important tuna baitfish in many areas ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.192). This may explain why the Tokelauan term for mackerel scad, a different fish but also a tuna baitfish, is cognate with terms for fusilier species in the following set.

[PMP &ast;_sulig_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-29-None-74-POc-sulik-a)

PCP/PPn _&ast;tikawa_ ‘_Caesio_ sp.’ is reconstructed by [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.152), [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.210).


<a id="s-30"></a>

## 30. Snappers or sea-perch, basses, jobfishes (Lutjanidae)


Snappers are rather large fish with a sheathed maxillary, typically red or yellow in colouring. Although known largely as reef fishes inhabiting rocky bottoms, the family includes deep sea snappers. Their flesh is highly esteemed, although a few have been implicated in ciguatera poisoning ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.288).

There are many species of Lutjanidae, some quite distinctive in markings, and Oceanic languages typically distinguish several taxa. I have seven possible POc reconstructions but, except for POc _&ast;qutur_ ‘_Aprion virescens_, green jobfish’, it is difficult to give precise glosses. Some are probably names of particular species, one or two are generic for two or more species, others may be names of particular species at a certain stage of growth.


<a id="p-75"></a>

<a id="fig-4-2_17"> </a>

[__Figure 2.17:__ _Lutjanus fulviflamma_, Dory snapper](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_17)



The proposed gloss of POc _&ast;qutur_ is based on the agreement of non-Oceanic cognates with those of the Central Pacific.[^19] _Aprion virescens_, the green jobfish, is found at depths that vary from 0-180 metres (FishBase). See [§20](ContributionTable?anchor=s-20#cldf:4-2) regarding the homophony of this etymon with POc _&ast;qutur_ ‘k.o. fish, possibly _Sphyraena_ sp., barracuda’ .

In the set below, the Andra, Kilivila and Temotu items reflect _&ast;bʷapa_ rather than _&ast;bʷawa_. I have no explanation for this variation. The Fijian and Polynesian reflexes show coalescence of _&ast;-wa_ as _-o_.[^20]

[POc &ast;_bʷa&#91;p,w&#93;a_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-30-None-76-POc-bapwa-a)

[Hooper & Huntsman](Source#cldf:HooperandHuntsman1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:HooperandHuntsman1991):120).

PPn _&ast;palu_ is included here with supporting evidence as an unusual case. [Hooper and Huntsman](Source#cldf:HooperandHuntsman1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:HooperandHuntsman1991):119-127) write that in Polynesia the two fishes which are associated most strongly with the name _palu_ are unrelated: the oilfish _Ruvettus pretiosus_ and the deep sea snappers (ruby snapper _Etelis carbunculus_, flower snapper _Pristipomoides zonatus_, big-eyed snapper _Pristipomoides argyrogrammicus_, and the small-toothed jobfish _Aphareus furca_). These fishes share deep water habitats, being caught at depths of 200 metres or more by handline fishing, with the long line carrying a series of spaced hooks. The technique requires great strength and skill, and Hooper quotes Roger Green as believing that it was probably a late Samoic-Outlier innovation, depending as it does on suitable deepwater environments where the fish can be found, calm water, adequate tackle and appropriate ocean-going canoe skills. We have no evidence that POc speakers fished at this depth. See [§56](ContributionTable?anchor=s-56#cldf:4-2) for Gempylidae, snake mackerels, oilfish.

## 31. Monocle breams, threadfin breams, sea breams, butterfly breams (Nemipteridae)


Most are brilliantly coloured, inhabiting sand and rubble areas around reefs. The flesh is of good flavour ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.308). One weakly supported reconstruction is proposed.

<a id="s-32"></a>

## 32. Threadfins (Polynemidae)


These are a small family frequenting sandy shores and muddy estuaries, and at times, coral reefs. They are known chiefly for the free filaments in the pectoral fin, a feature which is reflected in its name as a reduplicated term for ‘beard’. They also have a projecting snout and large adipose eyelids, which reflect adaptation to muddy environments where sense of touch compensates for loss of vision. The flesh has excellent flavour and texture ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 189).

Our only reconstruction is at PPn level, PPn _&ast;kumi-kumia_ ‘_Polydactylus sexfilis_. _Polydactylus plebeius_: threadfin’ (from POc _&ast;kumi_ ‘beard’ ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994):p.204). Hooper notes that the Tokelauan word for _Polydactylus sexfilis_ is _ava-ava_, also meaning ‘beard’.

Misima (PT) has a term _kum-kum_ ‘generic for damselfish, _Chromis_ spp. and others’, considered a chance resemblance.


<a id="s-33"></a>

## 33. Mojarras, silver biddies (Gerreidae)


The mojarras are small silvery fish with very protractile jaws, superficially resembling pouters (Leiognathidae). They move in large schools, mostly along sandy shores ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.331).

## 34. Sweetlips, javelinfishes (Haemulidae, formerly Plectorhynchidae and Pomadasyidae)


These moderate-sized fish inhabit coastal waters around coral reefs. Some, particularly the juveniles, are strikingly marked and brightly coloured, but colour pattern varies greatly with age. The flesh flavour is good ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.315).

Some of the following forms attributed to POc _&ast;(k,q)umutuR_ show loss of the first syllable. The only languages which disambiguate _&ast;k-_ from _&ast;q-_ are Nakanai, where _&ast;k_ is reflected and Wayan, where _&ast;q_ is reflected. The Gela term is apparently borrowed from a Northwest Solomonic language as it retains final consonant with echo vowel.

## 35. Grunters, terapon perches (Teraponidae)


Teraponidae are small Indo-Pacific fish occurring in shallow tidal, brackish or fresh water. Species differ greatly in proportions and colour, some plain and others conspicuously banded. Some species make grunting noises ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.320).

There is a PPn reconstruction, _&ast;kawa-kawa_ ‘_Terapon jarbua_, crescent perch’, based on Niuatoputapu and E Uvean _kava-kava_, Samoan _ʔava-ʔava_, all ‘_Terapon jarbua_’ but none for a higher order interstage. POc _&ast;kawa-kawa_ ‘rock cod, grouper’ ([§22](ContributionTable?anchor=s-22#cldf:4-2)) is considered unrelated.

<a id="fig-4-2_18"> </a>

[__Figure 2.18:__ _Lethrinus variegatus_, variegated emperor](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_18)



Emperors inhabit shallow coastal waters around rocky outcrops and coral reefs, moving in schools. Most are fairly brightly coloured in shades of red and green. Their flesh is excellent ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.324). Four genera are identified, _Lethrinus_, _Gnathodentex_, _Gymnocranius_ and _Monotaxis_. We have seven POc reconstructions, but in a number of instances their reflexes have come to be applied to different referents in daughter languages. In such cases reconstructions are simply labelled Lethrinidae or _Lethrinus_ spp.

In the following set there has been confusion with reflexes of POc _&ast;(k,q)ulapi_ ‘parrotfish’ ([§47](ContributionTable?anchor=s-47#cldf:4-2)) in Tokelauan.

<a id="fig-4-2_19"> </a>

[__Figure 2.19:__ _Parupeneus signatus_, black-spotted goatfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_19)



The Mullidae have large scales and two barbels at the chin. Small to moderate in size and usually red or gold, they are bottom-dwellers, often occurring in large schools ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.334). Genera include _Mulloidichthys_, _Parupeneus_, _Upeneus_ and _Pseudupeneus_. Both in Andra (Adm) ([McEldowney 1995](Source#cldf:Mceldowney1995)) and Kapingamarangi (Pn) ([Lieber 1994](Source#cldf:Lieber1994)), goatfish are reported as particularly numerous in stone fishtrap catches. Most species are considered good eating. We have five POc reconstructions, one of which is traceable with consistent referent back to PAn, and one which probably refers to a growth stage.

## 38. Sweepers (Pempheridae)


Sweepers are a small family of nocturnal fishes that spend daylight hours in caves and crevices of the reef. They sometimes form large aggregations which disperse after dusk and feed on zooplankton during the night ([Allen & Swainston 1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993):58). They are dusky silver or bright red, most with very large eyes ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.349).

No POc reconstruction has been made. A lower level reconstruction includes PCP _&ast;manivi_ ‘_Pempheris_ sp.’ (Geraghty p.155), PPn _&ast;manifi_ ‘_Pempheris oualensis_’ ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.213) (cf.

[__Figure 2.20:__ _Kyphosus cinerascens_, ashen drummer](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_20)



Drummers or rudderfishes are a small family. Fishes are typically small, finely and closely scaled, and dull in colour. Most species are pelagic, often found under floating medusae. They are herbivorous fish, feeding chiefly on algae and seaweed. The flesh is regarded as edible but of poor quality ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.352).

## 40. Silver batfishes, diamondfishes (Monodactylidae)


These are small, deep-bodied, compressed fishes, distinguished by their diamond shape and silvery colour and superficially resembling the juveniles of batfishes. They inhabit shallow coastal waters, preferring brackish water and sometimes penetrating into fresh water ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.348). No widespread cognate sets have been found.


<a id="s-41"></a>

## 41. Batfishes (Ephippidae (formerly Platacidae))


[Allen & Swainston](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993):58) describe the batfishes of the genus _Platax_ as among the most graceful of coral reef fishes. They are characterised by long, flowing fins, particularly in their juvenile and sub-adult stages. Adults have almost round bodies. Young ones resemble a leaf in colour and can sink inertly through the water, becoming difficult to see. Batfish are often extremely tame and curious. They are found both on sheltered inshore reefs and on outer slopes.

## 42. Butterflyfishes, coralfishes (Chaetodontidae)


Butterflyfish are among the most readily recognised of coral reef fishes due to their graceful shapes and wide range of brilliant colour patterns. Colours are usually combinations of black, red, orange, yellow and white. The fishes are diurnal and some species are extremely territorial, inhabiting one or more heads of plate coral. At dusk they retreat to reef crevices where they remain motionless until dawn ([Allen & Swainston 1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993):60).

<a id="fig-4-2_21"> </a>

Both [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p. 188) and [Hviding](Source#cldf:Hviding1996) ([1996](Source#cldf:Hviding1996):192) have commented on the fact that in Oceanic languages butterflyfish, coralfish and angelfish are sometimes lumped together under one generic term, although angelfish belong in a separate family, Pomacanthidae. Chaetodontidae are of little value for food, and there is apparently little point in distinguishing species or growth stages. I have two POc reconstructions, which presumably contrasted in meaning, but reflexes of both  _&ast;bebek_ and _&ast;tipi-tipi_ have in some languages been used as the generic form for butterflyfish, coralfish, and perhaps others, and I have been unable to differentiate between their meanings. Although the final _&ast;-k_ of _&ast;bebek_ is not supported by the evidence given here, there can be no doubt that the same word in POc referred to both ‘butterfly’ and ‘butterflyfish’.

## 43. Angelfishes (Pomacanthidae)


Angelfish are small to moderate-sized marine fish, frequenting coral reefs. They are close relatives of butterflyfish and the two families are sometimes included within the same term in local nomenclature. Like butterflyfish, they have extremely brilliant colours and complicated patterns. However, they can be distinguished by possession of a prominent cheek spine which can inflict a painful wound if handled carelessly. Some undergo astonishing changes in colour and markings with age. Larger ones are valued as food ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.371).

<a id="fig-4-2_22"> </a>

[__Figure 2.22:__ _Adudefduf_ sp., sergeant-major](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_22)



These are very active brilliant little fishes of the coral reefs, seeking shelter among branches of coral and in crevices. They are often left in tide pools. They are trim and shapely, greatly suggesting butterflyfish in mode of life. Coloration is highly variable, ranging from grey to yellow to blue. Genera include _Pomacentrus_ (damselfish), _Amphiprion_ (anemonefish, clownfish), _Abudefduf_ (sergeant-majors) and _Chromis_ (pullers), and there are dozens of species. Two POc terms are reconstructed, the second one, _&ast;taku-takuŋ_, possibly the term for juveniles, those of many species being distinctively marked by a yellow body with bright blue stripes ([Allen & Swainston 1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993):74).

Reflexes of POc _&ast;taku-takuŋ_, reconstructed below, have been reduplicated in various ways. Gumawana and PPn both reflect _&ast;t(o,u)kukuŋ_, where the first syllable, _&ast;t(o,u)_- is perhaps itself a reduction of _&ast;taku-_. Bing and Takia both reflect full reduplication after loss of _&ast;-k-_ Only Teop reflects the more usual Oceanic reduplication in _&ast;taku-takuŋ_. Central Pacific terms show assimilation of the first vowel _&ast;a_ > _u_.

## 45. Hawkfishes (Cirrhitidae)


Many Cirrhitidae are richly coloured and abundant about coral reefs and rocks. They are solitary and sedentary, frequently seen sitting on top of coral heads, from which they make quick short darts for food ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.442). Two reconstructions are possible at PPn level, _&ast;patuki_ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.157) and _&ast;qulu-tuki_ ([Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.206). Their association with _&ast;tuki_ ‘to beat, pound’, is not understood.

<a id="s-46"></a>

## 46. Wrasses, tuskfishes (Labridae)


There are over 400 species of Labridae, falling into some 60 genera which include _Anampses_, _Bodianus_, _Cheilinus_ (Maori wrasse), _Choerodon_ (tuskfish), _Coris_, _Epibulus_, _Gomphosus_, _Halichoeres_ and _Thalassoma_. Wrasses are brilliantly coloured, living around coral reefs and amongst weeds. Juvenile wrasses often differ from adults, and in some the sexes differ in colour and pattern. Some change colour and pattern with great rapidity ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): pp.402, 405). They are active during daylight hours, retiring to the shelter of the reef at night. Some species, such as members of the genus _Coris_, bury themselves in the sand. Most are medium sized fishes (about 20-40 cm), but the double-headed Maori wrasse, _Cheilinus undulatus_, is notable for its size, growing to over two metres in length. Oceanic languages typically distinguish many wrasse taxa. Although I have a number of POc reconstructions, there is little consistency of reference within cognate sets, other than within Polynesia. So, although in each case the POc meaning may have been restricted to one or more species, or even to growth stages, I am obliged to reconstruct in very general terms. In the following set, the Rotuman reflex of _&ast;mamin_ refers not to the Maori wrasse, but to the largest parrotfish, the hump-headed parrotfish, _Bolbometopon muricatum_, which resembles it. Although [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p.159) reconstructs PCP _&ast;mami_ ‘_Bolbometopon_, hump-headed parrotfish’, he does so presumably on Rotuman evidence alone.

[PMP &ast;_mamin_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-46-None-92-POc-mamin-a)


<a id="p-93"></a>

Both POc _&ast;mamin_ and POc _&ast;taŋapa(R,r)_ have reflexes which refer specifically to _Cheilinus undulatus_. It is possible that both POc terms referred to growth stages.

<a id="fig-4-2_24"> </a>

[__Figure 2.24:__ _Bolbometopon muricatum_, double-headed parrotfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_24)



Parrotfish are closely related to the wrasses, although the latter are carnivorous. Parrotfish are herbivorous, typically large, the jaws with a bony beak. They are reef dwellers, feeding chiefly on vegetable matter, but their strong beaks easily crush molluscs and coral. Most pass through one to three colour phases. Juveniles are usually plain, with mottling; immatures usually patterned with red, brown or purple, adults with blue, green, yellow, orange or red patterns ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.431). Like the wrasses they retreat into holes in the coral at night to sleep. Genera include _Scarus_, _Hipposcarus_ and _Bolbometopon_.

<a id="p-96"></a>

The double-headed or hump-headed parrotfish, _Bolbometopon muricatum_, is distinguished by its size and the hump on its forehead. While most species of parrotfish are under 50 cm in length, the hump-headed parrotfish can reach 120 cm or more. The Admiralties forms below indicate that there was a final POc consonant, probably _&ast;-q_.

The colour term green/blue has been reconstructed as POc _&ast;[ma]karawa_, PEOc _&ast;marawa_ (see [vol.2,207](ContributionTable?anchor=p-207#cldf:2-7)). This is no doubt the source of the following term for the green parrotfish. The Motu term can carry a number of modifiers which are also colour terms: _karava vaiuri_ (_vaiuri_ = purplish), _karava kaka kaka_ (red), _karava labora_ (yellow) (Nigel [Oram n.d.](Source#cldf:Oramnd)). The Micronesian forms reflect _&ast;maRawa_, not _&ast;marawa_.

## 48. Sandperches, Grubfishes (Pinguipedidae, and also Mugiloididae, Parapercidae)


Fijian _iko-tokoto-nivōsai_ and PNPn _&ast;takoto_ (E Uvean and Samoan), although evidently similar, are both independently derived from the verb PCP _&ast;(ta)koto_ ‘lie down’, which is typical sandperch behaviour ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p. 160). Samoan _taʔoto_ is glossed ‘saury’, a fish from a different family, but one which also tends to lie on the bottom, sometimes burying itself in sand. No widespread cognate sets have been located.


<a id="s-49"></a>

## 49. Gobies, including mudskippers (Gobiidae), blennies (Blenniidae)


Gobies are very small sluggish fishes abundant about reefs and coral. They are usually found sheltering among weeds, under stones or in crevices, in rock pools and quiet water ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.493). They constitute the largest family of marine fishes worldwide with several hundred species in New Guinea alone, but the paucity of terms in dictionaries for gobies suggests they are of little importance. There are some freshwater species. Mudskippers or land gobies can leave the water and hop or crawl over rocks or mud in search of food. They were formerly classified as Periopthalmidae, but are now considered a sub-family of Gobiidae. Blennies are small carnivorous fishes, living mainly in rock pools in the intertidal zone. They rarely swim free and spend most of their time concealed. Oceanic languages often group them with gobies which inhabit similar environments.

[POc &ast;_kakawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-49-None-99-POc-kakawa-a)

Lower level reconstructions include PCP _&ast;(m,p)anoko_ ‘generic for gobies, mudskippers, blennies’, and PPn _&ast;l(o,a)kuya_ ‘blenny’, PNCV _&ast;lavo_ ‘skipper, blenny’, PPn _&ast;talae_ ‘mud skipper’ (Geraghty p.160, [Clark 2009](Source#cldf:Clark2009):125, [Hooper 1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.218).


<a id="p-100"></a>


<a id="s-50"></a>

## 50. Sleepers, gudgeons (Eleotridae)


These fish are similar to gobies in their habit of lying on the bottom and rarely moving. Some species hover in cloud-like swarms over coral heads. Most are small and insignificant but there are some fresh water species which grow larger and are valued food fish in inland areas ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.512).

<a id="s-51"></a>

## 51. Whitebait


English folk taxonomies evidently use the term ‘whitebait’ for a range of very small silver schooling fishes from various families including Eleotridae, Atherinidae, Engraulidae, Clupeidae and Galaxiidae (smelts).

## 52. Flatheads (Platycephalidae)


These moderate-sized fish are adapted for life on the bottom where they bury themselves in sand with only the eyes exposed. Most are excellent eating ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.526). Thus it is surprising that few terms have been recorded from contemporary languages and no reconstructions made.


<a id="s-53"></a>

## 53. Moorish idols (Zanclidae)



<a id="p-101"></a>

Moorish idols superficially resemble butterflyfish, with strongly marked bands of black, white and yellow, but have a distinctive protruding snout. They are found around coral reefs in shallow water. Formerly two species were recognised, _Zanclus canescens_ and _Zanclus cornutus_, but the former is now considered the juvenile form of the latter ([Kailola 1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991): p.459, FishBase). [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.215) has reconstructed PNPn _&ast;laulau-fau_ ‘_Zanclus canescens_, Moorish idol’.

## 54. Unicornfishes, surgeonfishes, bristletooths, tangs (Acanthuridae)


<a id="fig-4-2_25"> </a>

[__Figure 2.25:__ _Naso unicornis_, long-snouted unicornfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_25)



All Acanthuridae are herbivorous coral reef fish, scraping algae with their fine teeth. Genera include _Naso_, _Acanthurus_, _Zebrasoma_ and _Ctenochaetus_. They have thick leathery skin and a spine with one or more knife-like barbs on the tail which are capable of severe wounding. Surgeonfish are so named because of these lancetlike spines, unicorn fish because of the horn-like projection on the forehead. Juveniles differ greatly and are usually separately named in vernacular nomenclatures ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.482). More POc reconstructions have been made for Acanthuridae than for any other family. Three refer to the genus Naso ‘unicornfish’, but only one, _&ast;qume_, clearly refers to a single species, _Naso unicornis_.

The following reconstruction, POc _&ast;piRa(q)_, is identical in form with the term for _Alocasia_, swamp taro, which, like _Zebrasoma veliferum_, is unpalatably acid unless the skin is carefully removed ([Geraghty 1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990):78). A parallel development is found in Rotuman, where _ʔapea_ means both ‘swamp taro’ and ‘sailfin tang’.

## 55. Rabbitfishes, spinefeet (Siganidae)


Rabbitfish or spinefeet are herbivorous fish, inhabiting grassy shallow waters. Their fin spines are very sharp and can inflict painful stings. They have characteristic rabbit-shaped heads. Their flesh is edible. Oceanic languages usually distinguish several taxa. Two Polynesian terms in the next set refer instead to Epinephelidae which resemble the Siganidae in having dangerous spines.

## 56. Snake mackerels, oilfishes (Gempylidae)


Snake mackerels (_Gempylus serpens_, _Promethichthys prometheus_, _Ruvettus pretiosus_) inhabit deeper coastal and oceanic waters, and are sometimes found at depths as great as 600 metres. The flesh is edible but oily. [Davis](Source#cldf:Davis1999) ([1999](Source#cldf:Davis1999): 164) writes that _Ruvettus pretiosus_ is so oily that eating even a small amount of its flesh has a strongly laxative effect. In some parts of Polynesia _Ruvettus pretiosus_ is known by reflexes of PPn _&ast;palu_, whose range of reference may also include jobfish and other deep-sea snappers. Both oilfish and deep-sea snappers are found at great depths ([§30](ContributionTable?anchor=s-30#cldf:4-2)). As mentioned earlier (p.78), the ability to fish water at these depths was probably a late Samoic-Outlier innovation. Some local terminologies group snake mackerels with barracudas, also elongated and slender with powerful dentition. In places they may also be identified with catfish (Pukapukan and Tokelauan _kapoa_ ‘_Promethichthys prometheus_’ > POc _&ast;kaboRa_ ‘catfish’). _Promethichthys prometheus_ has also been known as Bermuda catfish. Hooper has reconstructed PPn _&ast;maŋā_ ‘k.o. fish’ with meaning in Eastern Polynesian languages ‘_Promethichthys prometheus_, snake mackerel’.

<a id="s-57"></a>

## 57. Skipjacks, Spanish mackerels, mackerels, tunas, tunnies, albacores, wahoos (Scombridae)


Munro recognised distinct families: Katsuwonidae (skipjack and dogtooth tuna), Scombero-moridae (Spanish mackerel), Scombridae (mackerel), Thunnidae (albacore, tunnies, big eye, bluefin and yellowfin tuna), and Acanthocybidae (wahoo), but these have now been combined as one family, Scombridae ([Kailola](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991) ([1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991):467, FishBase). These fish are mostly large, fast surface predators, highly regarded both for food and sport. There is considerable variation in English glosses within cognate sets, due possibly to variable popular usage of terms like tuna, bonito, tunny and mackerel by wordlist compilers. In particular, although the English vernacular term bonito typically refers to _Katsuwonus pelamis_ (skipjack), it is sometimes extended to include any pelagic fish caught by trolling from fast canoes, including _Katsuwonus_, _Gymnosarda_ and _Thunnus_. Reflexes of POc _&ast;qatun_ may be similarly applied in both narrow and extended senses. _Katsuwonus_ (skipjacks) and _Gymnosarda_ (dogtooth tunas) are generally distinguished from _Thunnus_ (true tunas) by the former’s apparently scaleless body. Most skipjacks (bonito) are school fishes, found around the outer edges of reefs where they can be taken by trolling. They travel in large schools offshore along the coast at certain seasons, the schools often boiling at the surface. These fish have a special role in many parts of the Oceanic world. Simbo speakers in the NW Solomons divide fin fishes into three categories: _baɣea_ ‘sharks’, _iso_ ‘bonito’ and _iɣana_ ‘generic for all fish other than sharks and bonito’ (Bill Palmer pers. comm.). [Ivens](Source#cldf:Ivens1927) ([1927](Source#cldf:Ivens1927):130) writes that “to the Melanesian of the Southeast Solomons the catching of the bonito is one of the things for which he exists. To him it is the king of fish”. Solomon Islanders incorporate them in initiating ceremonies and associate them with various taboos (1927:130-131, 314, 329-330). Many different names are used for bonito in particular roles, a reflection of their importance in these communities. In similar vein, bonito fishing in Kapingamarangi is described by local fishermen as “their sport of kings” ([Lieber 1994](Source#cldf:Lieber1994):77). In Tonga also, the bonito is considered the king of fish ([Dye 1983](Source#cldf:Dye1983):251-2).

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002):130) notes that Tagalog is the only non-Oceanic language known to have a presumptive cognate, _atun_ ‘tunny fish’, albeit with an unexpected high vowel, and concludes that ‘_&ast;qatun_ probably was a lexical innovation in POc and that the early Spanish explorers in the Pacific borrowed the term from an Oceanic language (most likely in the western Solomon Islands) that preserved final consonants, and then introduced it into the Philippines’.

[PROc &ast;_tawa-tawa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-57-None-113-PROc-tawatawa-a)

_Scomberomorus_ (Spanish mackerels) are moderate to large predatory fishes occurring in schools in coastal waters. Larger ones are caught by trolling near the surface in the vicinity of coral reefs, rocky headlands and sunken shoals. Flesh is white, sweet, rather boneless and highly esteemed. There are perhaps four species of _Scomberomorus_. The largest, _Scomberomorus commerson_, the narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, has been known to grow to over two metres, although average size is considerably smaller ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.200). Although the following PMP reconstruction is glossed ‘_Scomberomorus commerson_, Spanish mackerel’, Oceanic cognates do not support a species-specific gloss for POc.

_Scomber_ and _Rastrelliger_ (mackerels) are small to moderate pelagic fishes, typically under a metre in length, which migrate in schools and comprise some of the more important food fishes of the world. Munro (p. 197) reports that they inhabit shallow coastal New Guinea waters where they are caught by seines or fixed traps.

[POc &ast;_jalala_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-57-None-115-POc-jalala-a)

_Thunnus_ (bluefin and northern bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, albacore, bigeye tuna) are heavy-bodied pelagic school fish. Most belong to deeper waters, but some inhabit the sea over the continental shelf and may be taken by trolling around reefs. Flesh, usually dark, is excellent, one species dubbed ‘chicken of the sea’ ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.200).

## 58. Marlins and sailfishes (Istiophoridae); swordfishes (Xiphiidae)


<a id="fig-4-2_30"> </a>

[__Figure 2.30:__ _Istiophorus platypterus_, Pacific sailfish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_30)



The Istiophoridae are identified by an upper jaw in the form of a long sword. They are big-game fish, large, fast and powerful, and pelagic in open waters. Three marlins are recognised, _Makaira indicus_ (black marlin), _Makaira mazara_ (blue marlin) and _Tetrapturus audax_ (striped marlin). The sailfish (_Istiophorus platypterus_) has an extremely elevated dorsal fin forming a sail-like structure which folds into a groove. The swordfish (_Xiphias gladius_) is readily known by its particularly long blade-like rostrum. The adult swordfish differs from the marlin and sailfish in having no scales. The name for the sailfish in PMP and POc, _&ast;saku-layaR_, is a compound, derived from _&ast;saku_ ‘needlefish, garfish, long toms’ ([§13](ContributionTable?anchor=s-13#cldf:4-2)) plus _&ast;layaR_ ‘sail’ (see [vol.1,194](ContributionTable?anchor=p-194#cldf:1-7)). Referential range in reflexes often includes swordfishes and marlin as well as sailfishes, although the first two lack the sail-like dorsal fin.

There is a second term which probably refered to a particular species or subgroup of Istiophoridae in POc. In some languages of the Solomons it has replaced _&ast;sakulayaR_ as the name for the sailfish. This may be a reduplicated form of POc _&ast;piRu(q)_ ‘fan palm’ ([vol.3,222](ContributionTable?anchor=p-222#cldf:3-7)), whose fronds resemble the large dorsal fin of the sailfish.

## 59. Flounders and soles: left-eye flounders (Bothidae), toothed flounders (Paralichthyidae), right-eye flounders (Pleuronectidae), soles (Soleidae)


Flatfishes are poorly represented in tropical waters in comparison with their abundance in cooler regions. Flounders, toothed flounders and soles are bilaterally asymmetrical, adapted for life on the bottom where they bury themselves in sand or mud. Most inhabit shallow coastal waters and estuaries. Larger ones are good eating ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.124). Flatheads have a similar habit of burying themselves in sand, but lack the distinctive oval shape of flounders and soles. Many contemporary languages have a generic term for flatfishes. We have two reconstructions, both with generalised gloss. In the next set both POc _&ast;alali_ and _&ast;lalali_ are reflected.

<a id="fig-4-2_31"> </a>

[__Figure 2.31:__ _Synanceia verrucosa_, reef stonefish](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_31)



Scorpionfishes and lionfishes were formerly included with stonefishes as Scorpaenidae, but stonefishes have now been classified as a separate family, Synanceiidae. The latter are shallowwater fishes, very sluggish, spending most of their life concealed in mud or among rocks and coral. Most have grotesquely misshapen heads and bodies covered with rough warty skin. If trodden on, they can inject an extremely painful neurotoxin which, in some cases, has proved fatal to man ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.538). Reflexes of POc _&ast;[ñ,n]opu(q)_ are numerous and widespread. Most Oceanic languages have merged /ñ/ and /n/, so provide no evidence for choosing between competing reconstructions, but Sudest reflects _&ast;ñ_ only, while Titan, Loniu and Wayan reflect _n_ only. Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests the _i_ of the Naman term _(ni)niv_ might be evidence supporting initial _&ast;ñ-_. Although the referent is consistent throughout almost all Western Oceanic languages, it has apparently become a generic for fishes with poisonous spines, including at least some scorpionfishes in Micronesia, Wayan Fijian and parts of Polynesia.

## 61. Triggerfishes (Balistidae); filefishes and leatherjackets (Monacanthidae)

<a id="fig-4-2_32"> </a>

[__Figure 2.32:__ Monacanthus sp., scribbled leatherjacket](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-2_32)



Triggerfishes (Balistidae) are characterised by a football shape, leathery skin, and small mouth with powerful jaws. They are feeble swimmers, herbivorous, generally solitary in habit, seeking shelter among coral heads and weeds. The flesh of many is poisonous, although others are used for food ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.557). Closely related to Balistidae are the Monacanthidae (formerly Aluteridae), leatherjackets and filefishes. They differ from triggerfish in skin texture, leatherjackets having a leathery skin while that of filefish is rough and velvety ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.564). Four POc terms are reconstructable, with _&ast;jumu_ the most likely candidate for a generic term. _&ast;bubu_ and _&ast;[bʷaRu]bʷaRu_ may, like _&ast;lio-lio_, have had more specific reference. Variability of gloss frequently indicates only variability of common names for the same species. For instance, common names for Pseudobalistesfuscus include the yellow-spotted triggerfish ([Allen & Swainston 1993](Source#cldf:AllenandSwainston1993)) or brown triggerfish ([Kailola 1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991)). Although juveniles have yellow lines and spots, adults have overall dark coloration.

## 62. Boxfishes, trunkfishes, cowfishes (Ostraciidae)


Members of this family are bottom dwellers in shallow water often around coral reefs. Normal scales have been replaced by bony plates fused into a hard box-like carapace. Mouth, eyes and fins are the only movable parts. All are extremely shy, feeble swimmers, but some are beautifully coloured. Some are reputed to have toxic flesh ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p.571). The next reconstruction is suspiciously similar to POc _&ast;[bʷaRu]bʷaRu_ ‘_Balistes_ taxon, triggerfish’, on page 122, but this seems due to chance, as the glosses clearly allow a separate reconstruction.

The next two reconstructions, _&ast;toqa_ and _&ast;moa_, are problematic. Lynch (pers. comm.) has suggested Proto Central Vanuatu _&ast;mʷatoqu_ ‘boxfish, _Ostracion_’ (Paamese _(u)matou_, Namakir _mʷa-mʷatoq_, Nguna _mʷatou_) which has echoes of both. There is also the possibility of parallel development, an outstanding characteristic of this fish being its resemblance in taste and texture to chicken, PCP _&ast;moa_ or _&ast;toa_ ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p. 166).

## 63. Puffers, toadfishes and blowfishes (Tetraodontidae); porcupinefishes and balloonfishes (Diodontidae)


Puffers are sluggish fish which fill the belly with air when disturbed, and then float to the surface. They are feeble swimmers. Closely related are porcupine fish which are also selfinflating, but distinguished by having moveable spines on head and body. Both are bottom dwellers, and the flesh of both is toxic ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): pp.545, 548). Although  [ACD](Source#cldf:Blust1995)  glosses PMP _&ast;taRutum_ as ‘porcupinefish, puffer fish, _Diodon_ sp.’, the WMP and CMP reflexes listed refer only to porcupinefish, and the reference to pufferfish is no doubt to the spiny puffer, an alternative name for porcupinefish. In Ambon (CEMP) a reflex is the term for a durian and in Ponape (Mic) a term for both the fish and a soursop (also a fruit with prickles), while in languages of Borneo (Kelabit, Katingan) and the Lesser Sundas (Manggarai, Lamaholot) reflexes mean ‘porcupine’. Both emphasise the semantic connection with porcupinefish rather than the smooth pufferfish. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002):130) considers that because porcupines (the mammals) are not found in the Philippines where PMP was presumably spoken, the term’s original reference was to ‘porcupinefish’.

## 64. Flying gurnards (Dactylopteridae)


Flying gurnards are semipelagic, with lesser powers of flight than the true flying fish. They are heavily armoured, with enormous wing-like pectorals. Essentially bottom dwellers, they are capable of short clumsy glide-like flights ([Munro 1967](Source#cldf:Munro1967): p. 541). [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994): p. 149) proposes PFij _&ast;lulu_, but no higher-level reconstruction has been made.


<a id="s-65"></a>

## 65. Remoras (Echeneididae)


Remoras (_Echeneis naucrates_ and _Remora remora_), also known as suckerfish, have a modified adhesive disk on the upper surface of the head with which they attach themselves to large floating objects, frequently sharks. The Gela (SES) term for remoras is _rao-rago bagea_, literally ‘joined to sharks’. I have no POc reconstruction for remora. I noted in [§4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4#cldf:4-2) that the Motu reflex of POc _&ast;maŋewa_ ‘k.o. shark’ and the PCP reflex of _&ast;bakewa_ ‘shark (generic)’ denote the remora, not the shark. [Hooper](Source#cldf:Hooper1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Hooper1994): p.216) proposes PPn _&ast;tali-tali-quli_ ‘Echeneis sp., remora, and _Naucrates ductor_, pilot fish’ with suggested etymology _&ast;tali-tali_ ‘wait upon’ and _&ast;quli_ ‘to steer’.

### 66.3. Scales


A POc verb, _&ast;qunapi-_ ‘scale a fish’ can be reconstructed, and it appears that a noun _&ast;qunapi_ ‘fishscales’ was derived by back-formation in POc, existing as a doublet alongside _&ast;qunap_. Polynesian reflexes of the following reconstruction refer to turtle shell as well as fish scale.

<a id="s-66-4"></a>

### 66.4. Fins


Many languages distinguish between pectoral (breast), dorsal (back), caudal (tail) and ventral (abdominal) fins. Reconstructions have been made for the first two. The reconstruction of the next etymon, POc _&ast;banic_ ‘arm, hand, wing, fin (probably pectoral)’, entails some minor formal problems. All cognates reflect initial _&ast;b-_ except those in the Central Papuan languages Balawaia, Motu and Mekeo, which reflect _&ast;p-_. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _&ast;pani(d,j)_ with either _&ast;-d_ or _&ast;-j_ as final consonant. The only Oceanic reflex with an etymological final consonant is Vitu _baniti-_, pointing to POc _&ast;-t_ or _&ast;-c_. The most straightforward analysis is that PMP _&ast;panij_ became POc _&ast;banic_ by regular sound change. The final consonants of Wampur _bani-t_ and Mapos Buang _bani-s_ can be ignored, as they reflect a probable construct suffix found on inalienably possessed nouns in Huon Gulf languages. The POc meaning of this term had clearly been extended beyond ‘wing’ to include the pectoral fins of fish, the wings of birds and the arms of human beings.

[PMP &ast;_panij_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-2-66-4-132-POc-banic-a)


<a id="p-133"></a>

POc _&ast;kaba_ (N) ‘wing’, (v) ‘flap wings’ (this volume, p.275) may be reduplicated to refer to the action of flapping back and forth, and in Polynesian languages this meaning is extended to include the action of fins, flippers and wings together with the name of the bodypart. Similarly, a number of Papuan Tip languages, Gumawana _pane-panena_, Molima _pape_, Wedau _papena_ and Mekeo _pa-pani_ use terms unrelated to _&ast;kaba-kaba_ to refer to both a bird’s wing or its flapping action and for a fish fin/turtle flipper.

The following is a variant of the same word.

Alternatively, a reflex of POc _&ast;taliŋa_ ‘ear’ is sometimes used to refer to a pectoral fin.

### 66.5. Fish gullet


The next POc reconstruction has general reference to ‘middle’, its meaning narrowing to fish gullet only at PPn level.

### 66.6. Barb of stingray


Reflexes of POc _&ast;poto(k)_ ‘thorn’ ([vol.3,125](ContributionTable?anchor=p-125#cldf:3-4)) have come to refer to the spike or spines of a fish in Wayan Fijian and the barb of a stingray in Polynesian languages.

## 67. Conclusion


In this chapter I have reconstructed around 145 Proto Oceanic names for fish spread across approximately eighty families. All reconstructions bar one are uninomials, the only binomial reconstructable to POc level being _&ast;paRi-manuk_ ‘_Aetobatus narinari_, spotted eagle ray’. Uninomials can refer to fish at the family, genus or species level, and in the case of sharks (_&ast;bakewa_) and rays (_&ast;paRi_), at the level of suborder. In a number of cases I have been able to identify a reconstruction as ageneric. Examples include _&ast;bakewa_ ‘sharks’, _&ast;paRi_ ‘ray’, _&ast;saku_ ‘needlefish’, _&ast;taRaqam_ ‘squirrelfish’, _&ast;kanase_ ‘mullet spp.’, _&ast;tuna_ ‘fresh water eels’, _&ast;qonos_ ‘_Sphyraena_, barracudas’. Generics may form the headword in a binomial subsuming two or more species, or may simply be used to include two or more subtaxa. Another kind of generic is that illustrated by _&ast;bebek_ ‘generic for butterflyfish, coralfish’, which is simply a lumped category with no sub-taxa. In some instances it has been possible to link a reconstruction to a particular species. However, for the majority of reconstructions it has only been possible to allocate an identity at the level of genus or family. Undoubtedly, POc fish nomenclature would have included scores of binomials, commonly at the level of species. My inability to reconstruct them is due partly to lack of detail in wordlists, but also to the likelihood of species variability across the region together with the apparent tendency of binomials to be local innovations. Most languages also have terms, usually binomial, for categories that cut across Linnaean categories, grouping fishes by functional criteria rather than by morphology or behaviour. Satawal, for instance, has taxa which identify such categories as flying fish, jumping fish, unpalatable fish, fish prohibited for women and children to eat, fish prohibited for pregnant and menstruating women, fish given preferentially to the chief, and fish that follow driftwood ([Akimichi & Sauchomal 1982](Source#cldf:AkimichiandSauchomal1982):25-6). Such terms also tend to be local innovations. Andrew Pawley has argued that Proto Oceanic probably had around 400 terms for fish (this volume, ch.3). The substantial number of reconstructions that exist for Proto Central Pacific and Proto Polynesian is largely due to the work of Paul Geraghty and Robin Hooper, building on [Biggs & Clark](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993) ([1993](Source#cldf:BiggsandClark1993)). Although Western Oceanic has far more languages than PCP, we have few wordlists from there which provide good descriptions of fish nomenclature. With the addition of more detailed wordlists from Western Oceanic languages, it should be possible for researchers not only to reconstruct more terms, but to further refine the glosses for those we have.

[^3]: Other totals recorded are 67 for Gela (SES), 66 for Wayan Fijian, 64 for Titan (Adm) and 62 for Satawalese (Mic).

[^4]: [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994)) has _&ast;gio_.

[^5]: Geraghty comments that the vowel sequence _-uo_ is rare in Central Pacific languages, and suggests that PPn _&ast;-io_ may be regularly derived (pers. comm.).

[^6]: An association with POc _&ast;pulan_ ‘moon’ is suggested, possibly a reference to its silvery colour.

[^9]: Clark also suggests POc _&ast;niale(u,wa)_ ‘freshwater eel’ (see previous set).

[^10]: Biggs’ request appeared in the an-lang list on 7 May 1999.

[^11]: The word _ato_ is not glossed by Chowning, but means ‘message, messenger’ in closely related Bariai.

[^12]: The great barracuda or giant sea pike, _Sphyraena barracuda_, is sometimes referred to as _Sphyraena picuda_ or _Agrioposphyraena barracuda_.

[^13]: The term _malisa_ ‘barracuda’ is quite widespread in Papua New Guinea, spread through Tok Pisin. which adopted it from Patpatar.

[^14]: [Barnett](Source#cldf:Barnett1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Barnett1978): 57) names ten kinds of _ʔurahu_ in Arosi, named for patterning or habitat or behaviour.

[^15]: Oceanic cognates justify a gloss of ‘rock cod’ only for PCP. However, Balinese _baŋ-baŋ_ ‘k.o. large sea fish’ may be external evidence for the gloss at POc level.

[^16]: [Ross](Source#cldf:Ross1994a) ([1994a](Source#cldf:Ross1994a): 418) discounted the Motu term as cognate on the basis that the initial consonants of Motu _dono_ ‘brown spotted rock cod’, Lala _dono_ ‘k.o. fish’ and Roro _tono_ 'k.o. fish' all reflect POc _&ast;s-_. However Motu _d-_, unlike the other two. also reflects POc _&ast;d_.

[^17]: Iaai normally does not retain final consonants, so this may have been a compound (John Lynch, pers. comm.).

[^18]: [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Blust1986): 73) lists a number of fish names with prefix _mala_ from Cebuano (WMP) (_mala-patí_ ‘k.o. fish’. _mala-sugí_ ‘swordfish, sailfish’, _mala-tindúk_ ‘mackerel scad’), and one from Samar (WMP) (_mala-punti_ ‘blue-spotted sea perch’), but there is insufficient information to identity a common meaning.

[^19]: Pendau (WMP) _utur_ ‘jobfish’ (Phil Quick pers. conun.) and Sangir _utude_ ‘kind of deep-sea fish caught by line’ (ACD).

[^20]: For a another example of _&ast;-wa_ becoming _-o_ see POc _&ast;maŋewa_ (p.31).

[^21]: _Lethrinus miniatus_ is the trumpet emperor, a different fish from _Lethrinus olivaceus_. the long-nosed emperor, albeit one with which it is often confused. _Lethrinus elongatus_ is a synonym for _Lethrinus olivaceus_, ‘long-nosed emperor’ [_Lethrinus miniatus_ or_Lethrinus olivaceus_!].

[^22]: NCV items are due to John Lynch (pers. comm.)

[^23]: Nehan _aŋ-uaŋ_ is a reduplicated reflex. As POc _&ast;w_ is lost in NW Solomonic languages, I infer that _-uaŋ_ reflects an earlier interstage _&ast;kuaŋo_ ‘emperor’.

[^24]: Bender et al. reconstruct PCMic _&ast;tawu_ ‘a fish’, but add 'the WOL and KIR forms are incompatible and probably both do not belong in this set'.

[^25]: [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty2010) ([2010](Source#cldf:Geraghty2010)) argues that PPn _&ast;wete_ may be a regular reflex of PCP _&ast;teu_ involving the following changes: (i) lowering of the final vowel to _&ast;o_. (ii) breaking of the vowel _o_ as _we_, and (iii) metathesis to _&ast;wete_. He has tracked the same series of changes in PCP _&ast;deu_ ‘unravel’ > PPn _&ast;wete_ ‘untie’.

[^26]: Admiralties terms apparently reflect Proto Admiralty _&ast;mʷacasei_ with some irregularities. Most other items reflect POc _&ast;mʷacasi_.

[^27]: Disambiguated from POc _&ast;buna(r,R)_ by evidence from Palauan _bils_ and Pendau _bunag_ (R. Blust pers. comm.)

[^28]: PCP _&ast;tuvu_ reflects the same assimilation of _&ast;-a-_ to _&ast;-u-_ as PCP _&ast;tukuku_ (< POc _&ast;takuŋ_) ([§44](ContributionTable?anchor=s-44#cldf:4-2)).

[^29]: The formal similarity to PEOc _&ast;lapi_ is probably coincidental.

[^30]: Reconstructed on the basis of Pendau (WMP) _lapeʔ_ ‘parrotfish’ (Phil Quick pers. comm.), together with the Oceanic evidence.

[^31]: _Hipposcarus harid_ is an Indian Ocean species closely related to _Hipposcarus longiceps_ ([Kailola 1987-1991](Source#cldf:Kailola19871991):377, FishBase)

[^32]: The species complex comprises _Chlorurus gibbus_ in the Red Sea. _Chlorurus strongylocephalus_ in the Indian Ocean and _Chlorurus microrhinos_ in the west-central Pacific (FishBase).

[^33]: Based on Pendau (WMP) _aroŋo_ ‘_Acanthurus leucosternon_, surgeonfish’ (Phil Quick pers. comm.) together with the Oceanic cognates.

[^34]: The Rotuman is in some doubt because of the irregular initial and the specific definition, though the final vowel is regular ([Geraghty 1994](Source#cldf:Geraghty1994):161).

[^35]: Reflected by Ambon _(al)ali_ ‘halibut, flounder’ and the Oceanic data.

[^36]: Also listed are a number of terms supporting PNCV _&ast;(s,t)umu(s,t)(V)_ ‘rabbitfish. _Siganus_ spp.’ (Vera'a _ʔumus_, Dorig _smut_, Lakon _tumuh_, all _Siganus doliatus_, the last two also _Siganus canaliculatus_, Mota _sumut_ 'k.o. fish'. Uripiv _sumus_, S Efate _smʷos_, both ‘rabbitfish’). If these are related to POc _&ast;jumu_, the PNCV reconstruction is _&ast;sumut-i_ and a final POc consonant _&ast;-t_ is indicated (Alex François. John Lynch, pers. comm.).

[^37]: Alex François (pers. comm.) points out that these North Vanuatu languages (+ other reflexes) unambiguously point to a sequence of vowels _&ast;u-o_, indicating PNCV _&ast;vutovuto_.

[^38]: WMP Kagayanen _kapi-kapi_ ‘fin’ (dorsal), Murut _ka-kapi_ ‘ventral fin’, Javanese _kɛpɛt_ ‘fin’ and Balinese _kepes_ ‘fin (generic)’ (CAD) support reconstruction of PMP _&ast;kapi-kapi_ ‘fin’.

[^39]: WMP cognates: Palauan and Molbog _sirik_, Minangkabau and Bugis _siriʔ_, all ‘(dorsal) fin’ ([Tryon 1995](Source#cldf:Tryon1995)) support reconstruction of PMP _&ast;siRik_ ‘dorsal fin’.

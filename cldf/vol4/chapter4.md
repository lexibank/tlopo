## 1. Introduction


This chapter deals with invertebrates that are aquatic or semi-aquatic, such as crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, sea-worms, jellyfish and corals.[^1] It addresses the following questions: (1) What terms for aquatic invertebrates can be attributed to Proto Oceanic (POc) and other high-order interstages of Oceanic? (2) What uses were made of these animals? (3) How does the number of taxa reconstructable for POc compare with the number attested in well-described contemporary languages?

The marine invertebrate fauna of the tropical southwest and central Pacific is fairly uniform, so that when Oceanic speakers first dispersed across this region some 3000 years ago they generally encountered familiar creatures. It must be added that not every island or island group has the full range of habitats: fringing coral reefs, mangrove forests, estuarine mudflats, seagrass flats, etc.

Molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms gathered in and around the intertidal zone form one of the most reliable protein food sources of coastal Oceanic communities. The bulk of foraging for invertebrates in this zone is done by women while in most societies diving for lobsters and deep water molluscs is mainly men’s work. Mollusc shells were traditionally made into a variety of tools and ornaments. Archaeological discoveries underline the longstanding importance of water invertebrates to speakers of Oceanic languages. Living sites and middens left by bearers of the Lapita culture contain extensive remains of molluscs and crustaceans and artefacts made from mollusc shells (see [§4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:4-4)).

Linguistic evidence that foraging on the reef for invertebrates was important to Proto Oceanic speakers is found in two widespread cognate sets noted by [Clark](Source#cldf:Clark1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:Clark1991)). Clark’s POc reconstructions are given below, with a few additional cognates.[^2] The first is a verb.

[POc &ast;_paŋoda_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-1-None-162-POc-paoda-a)

The second reconstruction, _&ast;p⟨in⟩aŋoda_, is a nominalisation of the verb using the infix _&ast;⟨in⟩_, which in POc typically derived a noun denoting the thing acted on or produced by the action of the verb. It is likely that _&ast;piŋoda_ was present in POc as a fast speech variant: reflexes of _&ast;p⟨in⟩aŋoda_ show loss of the second syllable in all Polynesian languages and in some North and Central Vanuatu and Papuan Tip languages.

### 2.1. Zoological classification


In the discussion that follows cognate sets presented will be grouped under standard zoological categories. Zoology offers a complex phylogenetic taxonomy of invertebrates based on current views of their evolutionary relationships and morphological characters. The invertebrate family tree distinguishes more than 20 levels of grouping from kingdom down to species. Here we need only note those distinctions which will be useful in organising the material from Oceanic languages.

### 2.2. Oceanic folk taxonomies of aquatic invertebrates


In order to get an idea of the likely size and taxonomic structure of the POc lexicon for aquatic invertebrates one must look at contemporary languages whose speakers exploit a marine and shore environment fairly similar to that inhabited by POc speakers. Unfortunately there are very few systematic studies in this domain. There is a fairly detailed account of aquatic invertebrate taxonomy in Wayan, a dialect of the Western Fijian language ([Pawley 1994](Source#cldf:Pawley1994), [Pawley and Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)) spoken on two small islands on the western margin of Fiji. Wayan speakers distinguish by name more than 240 marine invertebrate taxa.[^4] Almost 150 of these names apply to molluscs, about 48 to crustaceans, about 31 to echinoderms, about 12 to coelenterates and about five to marine worms.

Folk classifications of animals have many fewer levels than those recognised by zoologists. [Berlin](Source#cldf:Berlin1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Berlin1992)) has discussed at length the organising principles underlying folk taxonomies of animals and plants (see chapter 8 for more detail). As folk taxonomies go, the Wayan classification of aquatic animals is among the more complex. Some domains have a depth of six contrasting levels - two levels more than Berlin’s model recognises as the known maximum for folk taxonomies of wild animals.

[Table 4.1](#table-4.1) shows the contrasts between some first-order categories of invertebrates that occur in the Wayan Fijian taxonomy. These fall under no higher category other than _manumanu_, which refers to all creatures.

In many respects Wayan higher-order taxa differ markedly from those found in zoological classifications. For instance, there is no echinoderm category: sea cucumbers, sea urchins, starfish and brittle starfish are each assigned to separate primary taxa. There is no category corresponding to crustaceans. There is a general name for sea cucumbers but no overt taxon uniting the various sea urchin taxa (these animals represent a covert category, which Wayans readily identify by a descriptive phrase such as _manumanu laulau ni ðakau_ ‘spiky animals of the reef’). Unsurprisingly, octopus and squid form a primary taxon apart from other molluscs. There is a generic for gastropods (_ðiði_) but no generic for all bivalves. Instead there are generics for burrowing bivalves (_tavē_) and all kinds of oysters (_ðiva_). Wayan also has a category, _manumanu gwāgwā_, that refers to edible decapods, subsuming _ura_, _seka_, _tubā_, _uŋa_ and _tolā_. However, this is a ‘collective’ category rather than a true superordinate taxon: one does not point to an animal and identify it as a _manumanu gwāgwā_.

Systematic descriptions of other Oceanic taxonomies are admittedly few but the available evidence suggests that the size and taxonomic structure of the Wayan terminology are fairly typical of Oceanic-speaking maritime communities.[^5] It is reasonable to assume that the POc taxonomy was roughly of the same order.


<a id="s-3"></a>

## 3. Crustaceans


From the limited evidence available it seems that Oceanic languages spoken by coastal communities typically distinguish some 40-50 crustacean taxa, of which between 20 and 40 taxa are crabs.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>

### 3.1. Order _Decapoda_: crabs, lobsters, prawns


The crustaceans named and taken for food and bait in Oceanic societies are almost exclusively decapods. There is a well established PMP generic for prawns and crayfish, which is continued in POc.

[PAn &ast;_qudaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-1-165-POc-qura-a)


<a id="p-166"></a>


<a id="s-3-2"></a>

### 3.2. Palinura: spiny lobsters


The Palinura are represented in Oceania by two major families: (1) Palinuridae, spiny or rock lobsters and (2) Scyllaridae, slipper or shovel-nosed lobsters. (The terms ‘lobster’ and ‘crayfish’ are used interchangeably by many English speakers and the gloss ‘crayfish’ is commonly found in the dictionaries and wordlists.)

<a id="fig-4-4_1"> </a>

[__Figure 4.1:__ _Palinurus_ sp., spiny lobster](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-4_1)




<a id="p-167"></a>


<a id="s-3-2-1"></a>

#### 3.2.1. Palinuridae, spiny lobsters


Lobsters are prized food in the Oceanic world. Among the spiny lobsters the commonest species is _Palinurus pencillatus_, the common spiny lobster. _Palinurus versicolor_ is a larger, more colourful relative. These are distinguished as specifics in Wayan.

In contemporary languages reflexes of the POc generic _&ast;quraŋ_ (see [§3.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-1#cldf:4-4)) are typically applied to spiny lobsters (_Palinurus_ spp.) as opposed to the very distinctive slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae). It is likely that this was also the case in POc.


<a id="s-3-2-2"></a>

#### 3.2.2. Scyllaridae, slipper (or shovel-nosed) lobsters


Slipper lobsters are a family of clawless decapods with a very distinctive appearance, having a broad flat carapace and enlarged antennae projecting forward from the head as wide plates. Species of this family are found in warm waters throughout Oceania. A term for slipper lobster can be tentatively reconstructed for POc but the comparisons are phonologically problematic.

[POc &ast;_&#91;pa&#93;paba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-2-167-POc-papaba-a)

There is a well attested term in PCP which shows some resemblance to the above. However, the correspondence of PPn _&ast;t_ to Fijian _ð_ indicates a PCP palatal (which [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1978b) ([1978b](Source#cldf:Blust1978b)) writes _&ast;c_ and [Geraghty 1986](Source#cldf:Geraghty1986) as _&ast;j_).

[PCP &ast;_jabajaba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-2-167-PCP-jabajaba-a)


<a id="p-168"></a>

Another set of resemblant forms, represented in certain MM languages of New Georgia and Santa Isabel and in one SES language, shows a superficial resemblance to the Central Pacific forms but the sound correspondences do not match and point instead to an earlier form such as _&ast;pepete_ or _&ast;tepe-tepe_).

[4-4-3-2-168-mm-roviana-pepete](cf.csv#cldf:4-4-3-2-168-mm-roviana-pepete)


<a id="s-3-3"></a>

### 3.3. Suborder Natantia: true prawns and shrimps


In many Oceanic languages reflexes of _&ast;guraŋ_ serve as the general name for prawns and shrimps and this was evidently the case in POc. However, a second term, _&ast;luRa_, has reflexes in certain Micronesian and Fijian languages.

[PROc &ast;_luRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-3-168-PROc-lura-a)


<a id="s-3-4"></a>

### 3.4. Suborder Anomura: hermit crabs, mud lobsters, half-crabs


The Anomura, which include hermit and coconut crabs, are not true crabs but form a suborder that is sister to true crabs (Brachyura). They have a long abdomen and appear to have only three pairs of walking legs, the last pair usually being hidden inside the gill chamber under the carapace. The Anomura are an extremely varied group and no Oceanic language has a name for the group as a whole.


<a id="s-3-4-1"></a>

#### 3.4.1. Paguroidea: Coenobitidae (hermit and coconut crabs), and Diogenidae and Paguridae (sea-dwelling hermit crabs)


This group includes the familiar hermit crabs which carry a gastropod shell to protect their long soft abdomen. The coenobitids are terrestrial hermit crabs which have the left claw larger than or equal to the right. The coenobitids include the large coconut crab (or robber crab). The pagurids have a larger right claw. The sea-dwelling hermit crabs of the families Diogenidae and Paguridae are considerably larger than land-dwelling hermit crabs, growing up to 7 to 10 cm in length.


<a id="s-3-4-2"></a>

#### 3.4.2. _Birgus latro_, coconut crab



<a id="p-169"></a>

<a id="fig-4-4_2"> </a>

[__Figure 4.2:__ _Birgus latro_, coconut crab](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-4_2)



There is a strongly supported reconstruction for the coconut crab, _Birgus latro_, which climbs coconut trees to sever coconuts and is widely believed by Oceanic comunities to be able to open coconuts. This very large crab is considered a delicacy and has been hunted to extinction on some smaller islands.

[PMP &ast;_qayuyu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-4-169-POc-qayuyu-a)

POc _&ast;qayuyu_ was replaced in PMic by _&ast;afafi_ ([Bender et al. 2003](Source#cldf:Benderetal2003):12).


<a id="p-170"></a>


<a id="s-3-4-3"></a>

#### 3.4.3. Hermit crabs


A number of Oceanic languages distinguish several kinds of hermit crabs by name. The distinguishing criteria include size, habitat (sea vs land) and growth stage. For example, for Niuean [Sperlich](Source#cldf:Sperlich1997) ([1997](Source#cldf:Sperlich1997)) records four taxa of hermit crab: _āo_ ‘hermit crab, _Dardanus_ sp.’, _pulou_ ‘a hermit crab’, _uŋa-mea_ ‘a land dwelling hermit crab’ and _uŋa-uŋa_ ‘a sea dwelling hermit crab’. Hermit crabs are widely used as bait.

Three uninominal terms for hermit crabs are attributable to POc: _&ast;qumʷaŋ_, _&ast;koba_ and _&ast;kato(q)u_. It is unlikely that these terms were full synonyms. Unfortunately, the glosses provided for the reflexes in our sources are typically general and do not allow a semantic distinction to be made between the three POc terms.

_&ast;qumʷaŋ_ continues a PAn etymon. In Oceanic languages a reflex of this form commonly stands as a generic for typical hermit crabs, in contrast to coconut crabs. However, in several Oceanic languages reflexes have an extended sense that includes coconut crabs.

[PAn &ast;_qumaŋ_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-4-170-POc-quma-a)


<a id="p-171"></a>

A second term, _&ast;koba_, is less widely attested but reflexes are found in the Admiralties, Meso-Melanesian (in Northwest Solomonic) and Southeast Solomonic.

[POc &ast;_koba_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-4-171-POc-koba-a)

A third term has reflexes in Mussau, Southeast Solomonic and North-Central Vanuatu.

[POc &ast;_kato(q)u_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-4-171-POc-katoqu-a)


<a id="s-3-4-4"></a>

#### 3.4.4. Other Anomura: Thalassina, mud lobsters, and Porcellanidae, porcelain crabs (half-crabs)


There are only two species of _Thalassina_, the distinctive ‘mud lobster’ of the Indo-Pacific region, a nocturnal animal that digs a deep and intricate network of burrows in mangrove mudflats. It typically grows up to 16-20 cm long. _Thalassina_ are found as far east as Fiji and Samoa. The meat is bland and this animal is not a prized source of food but it is trapped for its edible claws in parts of Fiji. In the few dictionaries that provide names for the mud lobster each language has its own generic, e.g. Gedaged _gumei_, Nduke _zona_, Roviana _zoa_, Bauan Fijian _manā_, Western Fijian _tolā_, No POc reconstruction is possible.

Porcelain crabs (or half-crabs) are small, usually 1-2 cm wide. They are common on rocky beaches and shorelines. Names for porcelain crabs are seldom given in Oceanic dictionaries and no widespread cognate set has been found.


<a id="s-3-5"></a>

### 3.5. Brachyura: true crabs


True crabs are the dominant decapods on marine coasts. In true crabs (tribe Brachyura) the front pair of legs are clawed and the abdomen is reduced, flattened and folded underneath the carapace. Eggs are attached to the pleopods of the female’s abdomen. Of the many crab species only a minority are of economic value to Oceanic communities.

Oceanic speaking communities exploiting reefs and mangrove swamps typically distinguish between 20 and 30 crab taxa, excluding crabs of the tribe Anomura. For example, dictionaries of Arosi, Wayan Fijian and Niuean, list about 30, 33 and 22 taxa, respectively, excluding the Anomura. There is little doubt that POc would have had a similar array. However, only seven secure POc terms for Brachyura crabs have been reconstructed: _&ast;kape_, _&ast;kaRaka_, _&ast;kaRu(i)ki_, _&ast;kuka_, _&ast;rakum(u)_, _&ast;qalimaŋo_, _&ast;tubaRa_.

[__Figure 4.3:__ _Scylla serrata_, mangrove crab](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-4_3)




<a id="s-3-5-1"></a>

#### 3.5.1. Portunidae, mangrove and swimming crabs


Oceania has many species of portunids, belonging to the genera _Portunus_, _Thalamita_ and _Charybdis_. Most are large crabs, much valued as food. The English folk names ‘mud crab’, ‘mangrove crab’ or ‘black crab’ are often applied to _Scylla serrata_, a large round crab which may exceed 20 cm in width and which burrows in muddy shallow tidal waters of estuaries and mangrove swamps. POc continues a PMP term, _&ast;qalimaŋaw_, that probably denoted several portunids of the genus _Scylla_. Wolff’s dictionary of Cebuano describes _alimaŋu_ as ‘edible crab of tidal swamps, round in shape, up to 10 inches in diameter, black on back, white front, large meaty claws’, unmistakeably a large _Scylla_ sp.

<a id="p-173"></a>


<a id="s-3-5-2"></a>

#### 3.5.2. _Cardisoma_ spp. and other large land crabs


The large land crabs, _Cardisoma_ spp., are an important food source in many Oceanic communities and there are often several terms referring to their growth stages and spawning behaviour. For example, [Foale](Source#cldf:Foale1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Foale1998)) reports that in West Gela (central Solomons) females of the abundant land crab _Cardisoma hirtipes_ migrate to the beach at certain phases in the lunar cycle in the wet season, from October to December, releasing zoea larvae from their egg mass (_lami_). This is known as the _sau lami_ (wash eggs). Three weeks before doing this they migrate to the sea to immerse themselves, an event known as the _sapa toga_ (thousands go seawards). This is the preferred time to take them because they are fatter. In Fiji, Wayans refer to the mass migration of _Cardisoma hirtipes_ as _vui_.

[POc &ast;_tubaRa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-173-POc-tubara-a)

POc _&ast;rakum(u)_ is a well attested form which probably referred to a crab of some importance. Some witnesses (e.g. Kove, Bugotu, Namakir, Woleaian) support attributing final _&ast;u_ to this etymon; others are equivocal. Most sources give uninformative glosses for reflexes of _&ast;rakum(u)_ but in Mangap (North New Guinea), Roviana (Meso-Melanesian), Puluwatese and Ponapean (Micronesian), and SE Ambrym (North and Central Vanuatu) these refer to a land crab. In several languages the reflex has become a term for crabs in general.

<a id="p-174"></a>


<a id="s-3-5-3"></a>

#### 3.5.3. Grapsidae, (1) shore crabs, (2) burrowing crabs of mud flats


The most commonly seen shore crabs are the grapsids, which forage among rocks and coral rubble in the intertidal zone. The carapace is squarish, with very convex edges. The last pair of legs are not flattened but are adapted for climbing over rocks. There are several genera, including _Grapsus_, _Sesarma_, _Metopograpsus_, and _Leptograpsus_. Oceanic languages typically distinguish several grapsid taxa. For example, Wayan distinguishes two main taxa within the Grapsidae: mangrove crabs (_Sesarma_ spp., _Metopograpsus_ spp.), which are _kuka_, and shore (or rock) crabs (_Grapsus_ spp.), which are _galau_, as well as dividing the generics _kuka_ and _galau_ into further subtaxa.


<a id="s-3-5-4"></a>

#### 3.5.4. _Sesarma_ spp., mangrove grapsids


Judging by its reflexes in EOc languages POc _&ast;kuka_ referred chiefly to grapsids of the genus _Sesarma_, which live in mangrove forest mudflats. In Tolai (MM), Arosi and To’aba’ita (SES) and Lonwolwol (NCV) the reflex has become a generic term for crabs.

[POc &ast;_kuka_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-174-POc-kuka-a)


<a id="p-175"></a>

Reflexes of POc _&ast;kape_ typically refer to a kind of reef crab (Roviana, Gela, Rotuman). In Raga the reflex has become a generic term for crabs and in Arosi and Mota it appears to serve as a generic for a subclass.

[POc &ast;_kape_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-175-POc-kape-a)


<a id="p-176"></a>


<a id="s-3-5-5"></a>

#### 3.5.5. Ocypodidae long-stalked crabs (ghost crabs fiddler crabs soldier crabs)


The Ocypodidae are a very distinctive group of small crabs, with eyes on stalks, common on sandy beaches, mudflats and mangrove forests. There are several genera: _Ocypoda_ spp., ghost crabs, _Uca_ spp., fiddler crabs, and _Macropthalama_ spp., sentinel or soldier crabs. Oceanic languages typically distinguish more than one kind by name. Wayan has a generic for ghost crabs, _koke_, and two specifics for subtaxa. It has a separate generic, _tōlō_, for fiddler and sentinel crabs.

There is a well-supported POc term for ghost crabs, which continues a PMP etymon, _&ast;kaRuki_. WOc and Micronesian witnesses point to POc _&ast;kaRuki_. However, [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990): 62) reconstructs _&ast;kaRuiki_ to account for the agreement between Chamorro _haguiki_ (doublet _haguhi_) and the Central Pacific forms. For both POc and PCP it seems preferable to posit doublets, which perhaps were careful and fast speech variants. Polynesian and Rotuman reflexes of PCP _&ast;kauiki_ show reanalysis of unstressed intervocalic _&ast;u_ as _&ast;w_, with subsequent change of _&ast;w_ > _v_ in some languages.

[PMP &ast;_kaRuki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-176-POc-karuki-a)

There is another form partially resembling _&ast;kaRu(i)ki_ that is attributable at least to PEOc, showing _&ast;-pe_ instead of _&ast;-ki_ in the final syllable. This has reflexes in Southeast Solomonic and North and Central Vanuatu languages and in at least one Micronesian language.

[PEOc &ast;_kaRuve_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-176-PEOc-karuve-a)


<a id="p-177"></a>

No language is known to have reflexes of both _&ast;kaRu(i)ki_ and _&ast;kaRuve_.

The following PEOc reconstruction is not very secure, resting on agreements between two Central Pacific languages and one Southeast Solomons language.

<a id="s-3-5-6"></a>

#### 3.5.6. Crabs of uncertain family and families lacking reconstructed names


For some reconstructed crab names no secure family identification can be made. [Geraghty](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990) ([1990](Source#cldf:Geraghty1990):61) reconstructs PEOc _&ast;kaRaka_ ‘k.o. crab’. Extra-Oceanic cognates occur in Palauan kesako ‘k.o. land crab’ and Chamorro _hagahat_ ‘rock crab’ and these comparisons point to POc _&ast;kaRaka_.

[PMP &ast;_kaRakap_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-3-5-177-POc-karaka-a)

The following reconstruction is tentative.

<a id="p-178"></a>


<a id="s-3-5-7"></a>

#### 3.5.7. Xanthoidea


The Xanthoidea comprises several families, including Xanthidae, Menippidae and Trapeziidae. Xanthidae are the typical crabs of coral reefs, emerging at night. There are many species, quite variable in form but the carapace is usually broad in front, narrow at the rear. Some species are poisonous. The menippids and trapezids are similar in appearance to the xanthids. Wayan distinguishes at least three different xanthoids: _motodī_ (some Xanthidae and Menippidae), _vulau_ (some Xanthidae and Trapeziidae) and _galau ni waitaði_ (probably Libia tesselata). No POc terms are reconstructable for this group.


<a id="s-3-6"></a>

### 3.6. Generic terms for crabs


Many Oceanic languages have a uninomial that refers to crabs in general or at least to a large subclass of crabs, e.g. Molima _kakaʔu_, Maringe _kʰakau_ ‘crabs in general’, To’aba’ita _ŋuda_  (syn. _ʔuʔa_) ‘general term for crabs except hermit crabs and coconut crabs’. Dictionaries of many Polynesian languages (including Samoan, East Uvean, East Futunan, Pukapuan and Tikopia) describe a reflex of PPn _&ast;paka_ as ‘a general term for crabs’ or similar. However, one must view such glosses with some caution, unless it is clear that the authors have carefully investigated whether all groups of crabs fall under this rubric.

Often the generic for crabs also serves as the name of a particular crab taxon that is an important food source - a kind of polysemy that is common in folk taxonomies worldwide. For example, in Bauan Fijian the name _gari_, specifically applied to large mud crabs of the genus _Scylla_, is extended to embrace all typical crabs (tribe Brachyura) other than large land crabs (_Cardisoma_ spp.). The same is true of the Wayan term, _seka_. However, Wayans do not regard hermit crabs, coconut crabs and _Thalassina_ (all of which are members of the tribe Anomura) as _seka_.

While it is likely that POc had a general term covering some or all crabs we can do little more than point to three candidates. The strongest of the candidates is probably _&ast;kuka_.

As noted in [§3.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-4#cldf:4-4), reflexes of POc _&ast;kuka_, which probably referred chiefly to grapsid crabs that live in mangrove swamps, esp. those of the genus _Sesarma_, serve as a general term for crabs, or at least typical crabs (i.e. other than Anomura) in certain languages belonging to three different subgroups: Tolai (MM), Arosi and To’aba’ita (SES), and Lonwolwol (NCV). Reflexes of _&ast;kuka_ may occur more widely as a generic - relatively few dictionaries and wordlists provide precise statements about which crab names serve as generics.

Reflexes of POc _&ast;rakum(u)_ ([§3.5.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-2#cldf:4-4)) occur as a general name for crabs in at least one North New Guinea language, Mangap, one Papuan Tip language, Dobuan, and one Micronesian language, Woleaian.

A term for another grapsid group, POc _&ast;kape_ ([§3.5.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-5-4#cldf:4-4)), has become a generic covering both true crabs and hermit crabs in most or all NCV languages (François, pers. comm.). In Mota and Uripiv (both NCV) the reflex of _&ast;kape_ appears to serve as a generic for a variety of rock or shore crabs. There are signs that the Arosi reflex of _&ast;kape_ was once a generic for a range of sea and land crabs because this form now appears only as the first element in several Arosi compounds.

<a id="s-3-7"></a>

### 3.7. Other crustaceans



<a id="s-3-7-1"></a>

#### 3.7.1. Mantis shrimps (order Stomatopoda)


The mantis shrimps, Stomatopoda, are a distinctive group represented by _Squilla_ spp. and other genera. The fierce, predatory mantis shrimps are prominent denizens of the intertidal zone. They burrow in sand or hide in crevices and ambush prey. Few sources give names for these creatures. Among the handful of terms that have been noted, e.g. Gedaged _kalompit_, Nduke _hahaka_. Wayan _vidividi_, no widespread cognate set has been found.


<a id="s-3-7-2"></a>

#### 3.7.2. Barnacles (class Cirripedia, order Thoracia)


Barnacles are shrimp-like crustaceans that superficially resemble externally shelled molluscs. They attach themselves by the head to a surface and grow a shelly wall of protective plates. There is a Proto Cristobal-Malaitan form that may have referred to barnacles. This form has possible cognates in two Meso-Melanesian languages of the western Solomons.

### 3.8. Growth stages and sexes of crustaceans


Oceanic communities often have distinct names for various growth stages and sexes of important crabs, particularly the larger land crabs and coconut crabs. However, no widespread cognate sets of this sort have been found.


<a id="s-3-9"></a>

### 3.9. Body parts of crustaceans


Oceanic languages have names for various parts of crustaceans, e.g. Niuean _tuke_ ‘thorax of a crab’, _ami_ ‘crab roe’, _afo uŋa_ ‘breeding cord of a female coconut crab’, _nifo_ ‘nippers of land crab, etc.’ One secure reconstruction can be made.

## 4. Molluscs



<a id="s-4-1"></a>

### 4.1. Molluscs as a resource in Oceanic communities


Molluscs are very important sources of protein food in Oceanic-speaking coastal communities. A survey of the Milne Bay coral reef systems recorded 945 species of molluscs living in reef habitats ([Kinch 1999b](Source#cldf:Kinch1999b), [Wells and Kinch 2003](Source#cldf:WellsandKinch2003)). That figure excludes the many species that occupy mangrove and mudflat habitats, which were not surveyed. While the Milne Bay region has one of the richest marine faunas in the Pacific, it exemplifies the abundance of mollusc resources available to communities living close to coral reef systems.

Unfortunately, few good ethnographic descriptions exist of shellfishing in Oceanic communities. Languages for which there are near exhaustive lists of mollusc terms distinguish upwards of 100 taxa. Cemuhi of New Caledonia has around 133 terms for molluscs ([Rivierre 1994](Source#cldf:Rivierre1994)) and Paici, another New Caledonian language, has around 100 ([Rivierre 1983](Source#cldf:Rivierre1983)), Wayan (Western Fijian) distinguishes more than 140 mollusc taxa, including 105 gastropod, 35 bivalve and four chiton taxa ([Pawley and Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)). [Fox’s](Source#cldf:Fox1978) ([1978](Source#cldf:Fox1978)) dictionary of Arosi gives 104 names for kinds of molluscs. Sources for a number of other languages give impressive totals that are unlikely to be exhaustive. [Fox](Source#cldf:Fox1974) ([1974](Source#cldf:Fox1974):93) reports that the Lau of NE Malaita name some 75 kinds of shells. Churchward’s Tongan dictionary lists 63 names for kinds of shellfish. Waterhouse lists some 60 names for shelled mollusc taxa for Roviana and White (1988) gives 53 such names for Maringe (Cheke Holo).

One of the few good ethnographic accounts is a description of shellfishing at Nukakau Island, West New Britain, by [Swadling and Chowning](Source#cldf:SwadlingandChowning1981) ([1981](Source#cldf:SwadlingandChowning1981)). For the people of Nukakau, who speak Kove, shellfish are “especially important when fishing is poor and the weather too rough for fishing parties to go out” (p. 159). The three species that are most collected are three bivalves: _Geloina coaxans_ (Kove _tue_), which are gathered in mangrove forests, _Andara granosa_ (Kove _masilau_), gathered from estuarine mudflats, and _Andara antiquata_ (Kove _uleule_), taken from weed-covered coral reef flats. The shells of the first of these are also used as cutting and scraping tools.


<a id="p-181"></a>

The importance of shellfish to speakers of Proto Oceanic and its immediate descendants is shown by the large quantities of gastropod and bivalve shells, and artefacts made from shell, that are found in Lapita sites ([Gifford & Shutler 1956](Source#cldf:GiffordandShutler1956), [Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997), [Spriggs 1997a](Source#cldf:Spriggs1997a), [Swadling 1977](Source#cldf:Swadling1977), [1996](Source#cldf:Swadling1996)) and other archaeological sites associated with Oceanic languages. [Gifford and Shutler](Source#cldf:GiffordandShutler1956) ([1956](Source#cldf:GiffordandShutler1956)) identified at least 74 species of molluscs occurring in Lapita sites in New Caledonia. [Swadling](Source#cldf:Swadling1977) ([1977](Source#cldf:Swadling1977)) reports 54 mollusc species from the Taurama sequence in Central Province, Papua New Guinea, beginning around 2000 BP. Tools made from shells included one-piece fishhooks, adzes made from _Tridacna_ valves and food scrapers from various shell families. Kirch writes that shell valuables in Lapita sites included “rings, disks, beads and worked rectangular sections made from various species of marine shell, especially large cone shells (_Conus leopardus_, _Conus litteratus_) _Spondylus_ oysters, _Tridacna_ clam shells and _Trochus_ shells” ([Kirch 1997](Source#cldf:Kirch1997):236).

### 4.2. Class Gastropoda: univalves


The larger Pacific islands and island groups have extensive and varied communities of gastropods. On the reefs the following families are prominent: Aciidae, Conidae, Strombidae, Trochidae, Turbinidae. On rocky shores and in mangrove swamps the Neritidae and Cerithidae predominate.

POc reconstructions have been made for only a minority of families. A total of seven POc terms for gastropods are reconstructed here: _&ast;buli(q)_, _&ast;buRua_, _&ast;lala(k)_, _&ast;qaliliŋ_, _&ast;Raŋa_, _&ast;sisiq_, _&ast;tapuRi_. This is probably less than ten percent of the number of gastropod taxa named in POc.


<a id="s-4-2-1"></a>

#### 4.2.1. Strombidae, strombs, spiders, conches


Strombids are the well-known conch and spider shells, which live in sandy and rocky reef areas. The strombids are an important food source in Oceanic coastal communities. There is a widely-reflected reconstruction for the spider conch, _Lambis lambis_. It is likely that this term served as a generic for a range of spider shell taxa, as its reflex does in some daughter languages.

<a id="s-4-2-2"></a>

#### 4.2.2. Turbinidae, turbans


The turbans are herbivorous grazers common on intertidal and subtidal reefs, well-known for the operculum or ‘cat’s eye’ which the animal uses to close off the entrance to its shell. Turbans are an important food resource. Wayan has a generic for turbans, _kerekere_, as well as names for several subtaxa, and this pattern appears to be typical of Oceanic languages.


<a id="s-4-2-3"></a>

#### 4.2.3. _Turbo petholatus_


For the tapestry turban, Turbopetholatus, there is a well-attested POc reconstruction, _&ast;qaliliŋ_, which continues a PMP etymon. This term may have served as a generic for the genus.

<a id="p-183"></a>


<a id="s-4-2-4"></a>

#### 4.2.4. Other Turbo taxa


Usually a number of turban shell taxa are named, sometimes by a compound using a reflex of _&ast;mata_ ‘eye’, with reference to the operculum. The second element of PEOc _&ast;mata-buku_ is probably _&ast;buku_ ‘knot, lump, protruberance’.

<a id="s-4-2-5"></a>

#### 4.2.5. Cymatiidae, tritons


The tritons are a family of many species, which eat echinoderms and molluscs. The large shell of _Charonia tritonis_, Triton’s trumpet, is widely used as a trumpet for ceremonial purposes or to summon people to meetings. There is a widely-reflected POc reconstruction for triton shells, which continues a PMP etymon.

<a id="s-4-2-6"></a>

#### 4.2.6. Neritidae, nerites, and allied families of Neritacea


Typical nerites have globular shells with flattened base. They are vegetarians, living under rocks or in crevices close to the high tide mark. The nerite family contains marine, freshwater and terrestrial species. The wide range and abundance of nerites, and their importance as food, may explain why the generic for this family has come to be used as a generic for a wider range of gastropods in a number of Oceanic languages, including Takia, Roviana, Bauan, Wayan and Samoan.

[PMP &ast;_sisi&#91;q&#93;_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-2-184-POc-sisiq-a)


<a id="p-185"></a>

Some WOc and NCV languages reflect _&ast;siseq_ or _&ast;sisaq_ rather than _&ast;sisiq_. These departures can be explained in terms of dissimilatory change in which the final, unstressed vowel is lowered. Dissimilation of the final vowel, _&ast;sisiq_ > _sisu_ > _susu_, also explains Motu _dudu_ for expected _&ast;didi_.


<a id="s-4-2-7"></a>

#### 4.2.7. Cypraeidae (cowries) and Ovulidae (egg and spindle cowries)


Many species of cowries are present. The white or egg cowrie (_Ovula ovum_) is used in some societies as a decoration associated with chiefs and chiefly property. In Fiji, for example, these shells are hung from the ridge-pole of a chief’s house and in the western Solomons they are used as prow ornaments on war canoes. Oceanic languages generally classify cowries and ovulids together under a single generic with subtaxa distinguished by binomials. There is a well-attested POc reconstruction which continues a PMP etymon.

#### 4.2.8. Trochidae, top shells


The Trochidae are a family of shallow water dwellers, represented by many species, with conical shells and flat or convex circular base. Some are a valued food resource. Oceanic peoples traditionally made ornaments, such as arm and wrist bracelets, from trochus shell. Oceanic languages usually have a generic term for the family and several binomials naming subtaxa. There is a good chance that the term _lalai_, which entered Tok Pisin from Tolai, has spread from Tok Pisin into many vernacular languages of Papua New Guinea and the Solomons.

<a id="p-187"></a>


<a id="s-4-2-9"></a>

#### 4.2.9. Conidae, cone shells


The Conidae are all conical in shape, usually with long narrow aperture and smooth outer lip. Species vary greatly in length, ranging from 6 mm to 230 mm. The Conidae are carnivores and inflict a venom with a radular dart on the proboscis. The larger shells are much used for making bracelets and rings. There is a term attributable to PEOc whose SES reflexes generally refer both to the shell itself and to bracelets and other ornaments made of cone or trochus shell.

[PEOc &ast;_lako_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-2-187-PEOc-lako-a)

PSES _&ast;kome_ evidently referred to a particular kind of armlet, made from _&ast;lako_ shell. A partially or fully reduplicated form, _&ast;ko-kome_ or _&ast;komekome_, may have been a general name for cone shells in PSES. However, given that _&ast;kome_ referred to a valuable trade good, this term may well have spread by borrowing among languages of the central and eastern Solomons.

#### 4.2.10. Muricidae, murexes


_Murex_es have large shells, sculptured with knobs and ridges, spines and spinal cords. They are carnivores which live in the subtidal zone especially on sandy mudflats. Numerous species occur in the tropical Pacific.

<a id="s-4-2-11"></a>

#### 4.2.11. Gastropod families lacking POc names


For many groups of gastropods present in the tropical Pacific region no reconstructions have been made to POc level, even though names for these groups are present in contemporary languages. For example, POc names are missing for limpets (Patellidae), key-hole limpets (Fissurellidae), ceriths (Cerithidae), cones (Conidae), dog-whelks (Nassaridae), mud-whelks (Potomididae), helmet shells (Cassidae), tun shells (Tonnidae), miters (Mitridae), augers (Terebridae), turrids (Turridae) and drupes (Thaidinae).


<a id="s-4-2-12"></a>

#### 4.2.12. Generic terms for gastropods


For a small minority of Oceanic languages the sources give a term that applies to gastropods in general or to a wide range of gastropods. The fact that reflexes of POc _&ast;sisiq_ have this semantic range in a North New Guinea language (Takia _sisef_), and in the Fijian languages (Wayan _ðiði_, Bauan _siði_) might suggest that _&ast;sisiq_ also had a similar range in POc. However, comparison of the larger sample of cognates listed in [§4.2.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-8#cldf:4-4) suggests that it is at least as likely that POc _&ast;sisiq_ was a more restricted generic, referring to various small gastropod families and that more than once it independently became a term for edible gastropods in general. See ch. 8 for further discussion. Marovo (Meso-Melanesian) has a generic, _chuko_, that embraces most small to medium-sized gastropods but excludes nerites and turbans ([Hviding 2005](Source#cldf:Hviding2005):67).


<a id="s-4-3"></a>

### 4.3. Class Bivalvia: clams, cockles, oysters, etc.


There are ten pretty secure POc reconstructions for kinds of bivalves: _&ast;japi_, _&ast;kaRi_, _&ast;kasi_ _&ast;kuku_, _&ast;kima_, _&ast;sapulu(q)_, _&ast;tiRom_, _&ast;tu(qu)asi_, _&ast;tu(q)e-tu(q)e_ and _&ast;(w,y)aro_.

[__Figure 4.7:__ _Tridacna gigas_, giant clam](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-4_7)




<a id="s-4-3-1"></a>

#### 4.3.1. Tridacninae, giant clams


Giant clams are a small but economically important group that includes the largest externally shelled molluscs. The largest species (_Tridacna gigas_) grows up to a metre long. Traditionally regarded as a separate family, this group has recently been reclassified as a subfamily Tridacninae of _Cardiidae_. Giant clams are prized food, consumed at ceremonial feasts. In some societies edge-ground adze blades and shell rings were made from the heavy shells. Typically Oceanic languages have a generic referring to all _Tridacna_, with several binomials distinguishing subtaxa. Thus Arosi _ʔima_ is the generic and there are eight binomials (including one pair of synonyms) denoting subtaxa. Wayan has _vāsua_ as the generic and has three subtaxa: _(vasua) cavucavu_, _Tridacna gigas_, the largest kind, which is easily removed, and is symbolic of women because they marry away from home; _kativatu_, _Tridacna maxima_, is hard to remove and is symbolic of men, who stay with their father’s clan; and _vosavosa_, the fluted clam, _Tridacna squamosa_.

There is a well-attested POc generic for giant clams, _&ast;kima_, with a PMP antecedent.

[PMP &ast;_kima_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-189-POc-kima-a)


<a id="p-190"></a>

Reflexes of _&ast;kima_ are absent from Central Pacific, where it was evidently replaced by _&ast;(b,v)āsua_. This was the PCP reflex of a PEOc term for a large but unidentified shellfish species. Reflexes show unexplained variation in the initial consonant.

[PEOc &ast;_(b,v)asua_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-190-PEOc-bvasua-a)

The Gela and Arosi comparisons are problematic but they provide evidence, consistent with some Eastern Polynesian witnesses, that PCP _&ast;(b,v)asua_ derived from a pre Central Pacific form that referred to a group of bivalves other than the Tridacninae.


<a id="s-4-3-2"></a>

#### 4.3.2. _Asaphis_ spp. (Psammobidae) and cockles (_Cardiidae_)


There is a well-supported POc form, _&ast;kasi_, which referred to to the action of grating or scraping, to scrapers made from the valves of circular bivalves, such as _Asaphis_ (Psammobidae) and cockles (_Cardiidae_ spp.) and to the shellfish themselves, which are good eating. The vernacular term ‘cockle’ is used loosely in many sources, referring not just to shells of the _Cardiidae_ family but also to other small to medium-sized rounded bivalves with radial or concentric striae, including Psammobidae and Tellinidae.


<a id="p-191"></a>

[POc &ast;_kasi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-191-POc-kasi-a)

The next term, POc _&ast;kaRi_, may have referred to cockles or may have been a more general term for a wider range of small to medium-sized bivalves.

[POc &ast;_kaRi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-191-POc-kari-a)

PPn _&ast;pipi_ appears to have applied to various circular bivalves including _Asaphis_ sp. or spp. Its reflexes are of interest because in several cases (Kapingamarangi, Pukapukan, Rennellese and Tikopia) they have become a generic for bivalves.

<a id="p-192"></a>


<a id="s-4-3-3"></a>

#### 4.3.3. Mytilidae, mussels


Mussels occur in dense colonies on rocky shores, attaching themselves to surfaces by byssus threads. They fall into several subfamilies. _Mytilus_ spp. predominate in cold waters but in tropical waters they are replaced by species of the subfamilies Modiolinae and Lithophaginae. Commonly Oceanic languages distinguish two or more mussel taxa by name, e.g. Wayan has a generic term _boro_, with two subtaxa: _boro boro_, probably _Modiolus plumescens_, and _drivi_ ‘small mussels with black shell, possibly _Lithophaga_ sp.

Blust (1972:10) relates POc _&ast;kuku(r)_ ‘? mussel sp.’ to PAn _&ast;kuDkuD_ ‘rasp, file’, noting reflexes such as Tagalog _kudkod_, Toba Batak _hurhur_ ‘grated’, Ngadju Dayak _kukur_ ‘rasp, grater’. It is likely that POc _&ast;kuku(r)_ was polysemous, referring both to food scrapers of various kinds of shells and to mussels, which were used as scrapers.

[POc &ast;_kuku(r)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-192-POc-kukur-a)


<a id="s-4-3-4"></a>

#### 4.3.4. Ostreidae, rock oysters


The English folk category ‘oyster’ refers to several families of bivalves, including Ostreidae (typical oysters), Isognomonidae (mangrove oysters), Malleidae (hammer oysters), Pteridae (pearl and wing oysters) and Spondylidae (thorny oysters), the latter being more closely related to scallops than to the other ‘oyster’ families. Wayan Fijian has a generic term, _ðiva_, with a similarly broad range of reference.

POc _&ast;tiRom_ continues a PAn term for oyster. The range of the POc term probably included both typical oysters (Ostreidae), which attach themselves by cementing one valve to rocks or wood, and tree oysters (Isognominidae), found mainly among mangrove roots or under rocks in the intertidal zone. Only a few species of Isognomonidae occur in the Pacific Islands.


<a id="p-193"></a>

[PMP &ast;_tiRem_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-193-POc-tirom-a)


<a id="s-4-3-5"></a>

#### 4.3.5. Pteridae, pearl and wing oysters, and Malleidae, hammer oysters


The family Pteridae includes pearl and wing oysters, which live on rocky ocean floors. They have moderate to large shells with one valve more inflated, with pearly interior. The Malleidae, hammer oysters, have ears drawn out into elongate wings. The common hammer oyster, _Malleus malleus_, anchors to the bottom in shallow reef waters.

The gold-lip pearl shell, _Pinctada maxima_, and the black-lip pearl, _Pinctada margaritifera_, were traditionally important as a trade item and source of ornaments, especially the breastplate crescent made from the lip of this shell and worn by men. Although they are widely distributed species [Swadling](Source#cldf:Swadling1994) ([1994](Source#cldf:Swadling1994)) reports that the environmental conditions for dense concentrations of gold- and black-lip pearl shells occur only in a few parts of Papua New Guinea (Manus Province, Ramoaaina Islands, Arawe Islands, Brooker and Moturina in the Calvados chain, eastern Milne Bay Province, and the Torres Strait Islands). Pearl oysters are absent from the more southerly subtropical parts of Polynesia, and in some other parts of Polynesia, including Tonga and Samoa, occur in locations that were not easily accessible to divers. The importance of pearl shell ornaments as trade valuables no doubt led to borrowing of the names for these in some regions. However, the fact that reflexes of _&ast;japi_, showing regular sound shifts, are found from New Guinea to Polynesia is strong evidence of the POc antiquity of this term.

[POc &ast;_japi_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-193-POc-japi-a)


<a id="p-194"></a>

The next two sets probably belong to the same etymon, _w/y_ crossover occurs in certain other forms. The Gela reflex is compatible with either set because word-initial _&ast;w_ is lost in Gela.

#### 4.3.6. Pinnidae, pen shells


The Pinnidae or pen shells have large fragile shells. They live buried in soft sand anchored by a silk byssus. The following reconstruction is tentatively associated with the genus _Pinna_ because of the Gela and Fijian reflexes. In Cristobal-Malaita languages the reflex refers to black mussels, from which bonito hooks are made.

<a id="s-4-3-7"></a>

#### 4.3.7. Lucinidae and allied families


Lucinoidea (Lucinidae and three other families) are often the dominant bivalves in shallow sea grass bed habitats, esp. species of _Codakia_, _Ctena_, _Lucina_, _Lucinisca_, _Loripes_ and _Anodonta_, and are an important food source. The Lucinidae have certain unusual anatomical features including a foot, used for burrowing, that can be extended 4 to 6 times the length of the animal. There is no secure POc reconstruction for this family but the following is a candidate.

<a id="s-4-3-8"></a>

#### 4.3.8. Reconstructions for bivalves of uncertain family


Some etyma have reflexes that are so semantically diverse or so vaguely glossed in the sources that the reconstructed name cannot be associated with a particular family. For POc _&ast;sisira_ ‘a barnacle or k.o. small mollusc’ see [§3.6](ContributionTable?anchor=s-3-6#cldf:4-4). The following reconstruction is very tentative, because the putative cognates are few and because the semantic agreement is weak.

[POc &ast;_tape_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-196-POc-tape-a)

The following term may have applied to a kind of pearl shell, with a shift of referent in Bugotu and Maringe arising from the use of pieces of nautilus shell for inlaying in woodwork.

[PWOc &ast;_bio_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-196-PWOc-bio-a)

The following cognate set appears to be restricted to Meso-Melanesian.

[PMM &ast;_game_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-3-196-PMM-game-a)


<a id="p-197"></a>

The following term may have referred both to a bivalve shellfish and to spoons or graters made from its shell. Only a single WOc reflex has been noted. The Niuatoputapu reflex points to PPn _&ast;tuquahi_, with glottal stop, whereas the Tongan reflex points to _&ast;tuahi_. Those Polynesian forms that refer only to coconut grater may have spread by borrowing.

<a id="s-4-3-9"></a>

#### 4.3.9. Bivalve families lacking definite POc reconstructions


There are several prominent families of bivalves for which no definite POc names can be reconstructed. These include scallops (Pectinidae), thorny oysters (Spondylidae), jewelboxes (Chamidae), tellins (Tellinidae), sanguins (Garidae), wedge shells (Donacidae), venus shells (Veneridae), and olives (Olividae).


<a id="s-4-3-10"></a>

#### 4.3.10. Generic term for bivalves


Some contemporary languages have a generic covering all or most bivalves. This is often a polysemous term, which also refers to an important specific taxon. For example, the Bauan generic _kai_ is also the term for cockles, Wayan _tavē_ is also the term for tellins and sanguins. In several Polynesian languages reflexes of PPn _&ast;pipi_, probably originally referring chiefly to cockles, has become a generic for a wide range of bivalves ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:4-4)).


<a id="s-4-4"></a>

### 4.4. Polyplacophora: chitons


Chitons are flattened, slug-like molluscs, most species covered with eight shingle-like plates. They feed on algae. Chitons are usually represented in Oceanic languages by a uninomial generic (e.g. Gedaged _dabag_) and some languages also have several binomials naming specific kinds. There is a well-supported PEOc reconstruction but there are no certain cognates in WOc.

[PEOc &ast;_tadruku_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-4-197-PEOc-tadruku-a)


<a id="p-198"></a>

In PPn _&ast;mama_ replaced _&ast;tadruku_ as the generic for chitons. PPn _&ast;mama_ is probably cognate with Southeast Solomonic _&ast;mama_, referring to a kind of anemone or jellyfish (see [§6.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-6-3#cldf:4-4)).

[PPn &ast;_mama_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-4-198-PPn-mama-a)


<a id="s-4-5"></a>

### 4.5. A term for shellfish in general


Did POc speakers have a name for shellfish (shelled molluscs) in general? As noted in section 1, POc had a broad collective term, _&ast;pinaŋoda_, denoting ‘marine invertebrates, sea animals other than fish gathered on the reef’. In a few languages the reflex has become a general term for bivalves and gastropods, sometimes also including sea urchins, e.g. Samoan _fiŋota_ ‘generic for shelled molluscs and other invertebrates’, Tokelauan _fiŋota_ ‘bivalves, gastropods and sea urchins’.

A term specifically denoting all and only shellfish is present in some Oceanic languages. For example, [Foale](Source#cldf:Foale1998) ([1998](Source#cldf:Foale1998)) reports that Gela (SES) _vaŋuda_ is normally used as generic for molluscs but can be extended to include crustaceans and echinoderms. Lau (SES) has a noncognate form with similar function: _karoŋo_ (1) ‘shelled mollusc, marine or land’; (2) ‘any invertebrate collected on reef at low tide: shellfish, crabs, squids’, as does Niuean _fua_ ‘shellfish and echinoderms’. Motu (PT) has _bisisi_ ‘general name for all shellfish’ and Takia (NNG) has _sisei_ ‘generic for all varieties of shells’. [Akimichi and Sakiyama](Source#cldf:AkimichiandSakiyama1991) ([1991](Source#cldf:AkimichiandSakiyama1991)) report that Penchal (Adm) _mʷel_ has two senses: (1) ‘shellfish’; (2)‘shellfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers’ and that in nearby Lenkau the cognate term _mʷe_ also has two senses: (1) ‘shellfish’ and (2) ‘shellfish, cephalopods and sea urchins and sea cucumbers’. We can conclude that POc may well have had a general term for shellfish. However, in the absence of a widespread cognate set no reconstruction can be made.

### 4.6. Cephalopoda: octopus, squid, nautilus


The cephalopods include (1) the octopus and argonaut group, with eight tentacles; (2) the squid and spirula group, with ten, and (3) the chambered nautilus, which inhabits the deep sea and is rarely encountered alive. Groups (1) and (2) are valued food sources.


<a id="s-4-6-1"></a>

#### 4.6.1. Octopus


Several species of octopus occur in the Pacific, two common ones being _Octopus cyanea_, the day octopus or common reef octopus, and the smaller _Octopus ornatus_, the night octopus. Some Oceanic languages name several different taxa by size, shape and habits. There is a widely-reflected generic going back to PAn.

<a id="s-4-6-2"></a>

#### 4.6.2. Squid and cuttlefish


Squids have 10 arms and a thin, plastic-like internal shell, which in the cuttlefish (_Sepia_ spp.) takes the form of a flat rigid bone. Several squid and cuttlefish species occur in Pacific shallow waters, ranging in size from just a few cm to quite large.

POc had at least two terms for squid/cuttlefish taxa: _&ast;nusa_ (with doublet _&ast;nus_) and _&ast;mʷanagi_ (with doublet _&ast;mʷamʷagi_).

_&ast;nusa_ and _&ast;nus_ seem to have referred to small squid and small cuttlefish. [Blust](Source#cldf:Blust1986) ([1986](Source#cldf:Blust1986)) reconstructs PMP _&ast;nus_ ‘squid, cuttlefish’, based on forms such as Malay _nus_ ‘generic for cephalopods’ and Roti _nus_ ‘octopus, squid’, with a doublet _&ast;kanuqus_. _&ast;nusa_ is reflected by the following:


<a id="p-200"></a>

[POc &ast;_nusa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-6-200-POc-nusa-a)

POc _&ast;nus_ has reflexes in Admiralties, North New Guinea and Central Pacific.

[POc &ast;_nus_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-4-6-200-POc-nus-a)

_&ast;mʷanagi_ (dbl. _&ast;mʷamʷagi_) possibly referred to larger cuttlefish. This term has reflexes in WOc and in SES.

### 4.7. Parts of molluscs


Oceanic languages usually have names for various parts of molluscs including beak, tentacles, suckers of octopus, mantle, foot, proboscis, gonads, innards of shellfish, shell, valve and hinge of bivalves, etc. Only a few part names are reconstructable to the level of POc.

### 4.8. Artefacts made from shell


As indicated in [§4.1](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-1#cldf:4-4), POc speakers made a variety of artefacts from shell. Reconstructed terms include a number which refer both to the shell and animal and to the artefact made from the shell: _&ast;japi_ ‘crescent breast ornament made from pearl shell, probably worn by high status men’ ([§4.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-5#cldf:4-4)), _&ast;lala(k)_ ‘rings or armlets of trochus shell’ ([§4.2.8](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-8#cldf:4-4)), _&ast;tapuRiq_ ‘trumpet, of triton shell’ ([§4.2.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-5#cldf:4-4)), _&ast;buli(q)_ ‘cowry shell sinkers’ ([§4.2.7](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-2-7#cldf:4-4)), _&ast;kaRi_, _&ast;kasi_, and _&ast;kuku(r)_ ‘cutting and scraping instruments of bivalve shells’ ([§4.3.2](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-2#cldf:4-4), [§4.3.5](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-3-5#cldf:4-4)). A few terms for artefacts sometimes or usually made from shell can be reconstructed, e.g. _&ast;kiRam_ ‘adze or axe (generic but applied to edge-ground axes made of tridacna shell), _&ast;kawil_ ‘fish-hook’, and _&ast;sabi-sabi_ ‘shell disk used as ear-ring (in Massim made of _Chama pacifica_) (see [vol.1,104](ContributionTable?anchor=p-104#cldf:1-4)).


<a id="s-5"></a>

## 5. Echinodermata: sea urchins, sea cucumbers, starfish, etc.


The echinoderms include sea urchins (sea-eggs), sea cucumbers, starfish, brittle stars, feather stars and sand dollars. All possess tube feet and have a body pattern structured in fives. However, the various groups are very diverse in form.


<a id="s-5-1"></a>

### 5.1. Echinoidea: sea urchins


Sea urchins are represented in Oceania by numerous genera and species. These include long-spined echinoderms (esp. _Echinothrix_ and _Diadema_ spp.), short-spined rock-boring urchins (_Echinometra_ spp.) and slate pencil urchins, Heterocentrus mammilatus. Some sea urchins are eaten. It is seems that few Oceanic languages have a folk generic covering all sea urchins. In Wayan echinoderms are recognised as a covert taxon, sometimes referred to by a phrase meaning ‘spiky animals of the reef’.


<a id="s-5-1-1"></a>

#### 5.1.1. _Echinometra_ spp., rock-boring urchins


There is a POc reconstruction for short-spined rock-boring urchins, _Echinometra_ spp., and possibly also _Tripneustes_ spp.


<a id="p-203"></a>

[POc &ast;_saRawaki_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-1-203-POc-sarawaki-a)


<a id="s-5-1-2"></a>

#### 5.1.2. Long-spined sea urchins


The following POc term probably referred to certain long-spined urchins, including _Diadema_ spp., and possibly _Astropyga_ and _Echinothrix_ spp.

[POc &ast;_sala(n,ŋ)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-1-203-POc-salan-a)

A second term, _&ast;gina_, is attributable to PEOc, having reflexes in S.E. Solomonic, North-Central Vanuatu and Central Pacific.

[PEOc &ast;_gina_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-1-203-PEOc-gina-a)


<a id="p-204"></a>

The term _&ast;wana_, for a long-spined urchin, is tentatively attributable to PCP.

[PCP &ast;_wana_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-1-204-PCP-wana-a)


<a id="s-5-2"></a>

### 5.2. Holothuroidea: sea cucumbers (bêche de mer, trepang, holothurians)



<a id="s-5-2-1"></a>

#### 5.2.1. Terms for specific taxa


Firm-bodied sea cucumbers are relatively short and fat, with tube feet on the ventral surface. The thin-bodied, worm-like sea cucumbers lack tube feet. Some sea cucumbers are eaten by Oceanic communities. Tongan distinguishes some 18 sea cucumber taxa ([Churchward 1959](Source#cldf:Churchward1959)) and Wayan about 19 ([Pawley and Sayaba 2003](Source#cldf:PawleyandSayaba2003)).

[Blust](Source#cldf:Blust2002) ([2002](Source#cldf:Blust2002)) reconstructs PWMP _&ast;balat_ ‘sea cucumber’ but no Oceanic cognates have been noted. Only one POc term for a sea cucumber taxon has been reconstructed, _&ast;(b,p)ula_.

[POc &ast;_(p,b)ula_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-204-POc-pbula-a)


<a id="p-205"></a>

The following three terms are attributable to PCP.

[PCP &ast;_loli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-205-PCP-loli-a)

[PCP &ast;_tarasea_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-205-PCP-tarasea-a)

The following term literally means ‘eight breasts’, in reference to the nipple-like lumps on the upper body of this animal.

[PCP &ast;_ðuðu-walu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-205-PCP-uuwalu-a)

There is a POc reconstruction, _&ast;qanupe_, whose meaning is indeterminate between ‘caterpillar’ and ‘k.o. sea cucumber’. All known WOc reflexes refer to sea cucumbers while all Eastern Oceanic reflexes refer to caterpillars (see [ch.7, §17](ContributionTable?anchor=s-17#cldf:4-7)). When glossing the POc etymon one cannot, without external cognates, determine which of these two competing glosses was original, or indeed whether the POc form has two senses. In Wayan Fijian the English loan _katavila_ refers both to caterpillars and to a kind of sea cucumber with caterpillar-like spiky protrusions.


<a id="p-206"></a>

[POc &ast;_qanupe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-206-POc-qanupe-a)

[PEOc &ast;_qanupe_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-2-206-PEOc-qanupe-a)


<a id="s-5-2-2"></a>

#### 5.2.2. General term for sea cucumbers


Oceanic languages commonly have a general term for sea cucumbers, or more specifically for firm-bodied holothurids with tubular feet. (Long thin, soft-bodied holothurids lacking tubular feet are often classified as ‘worms’.) In the Fijian languages the generic term for firm-bodied holothurids is _drī_, in Marovo it is _puhaka_, in Nelemwa it is _imale_ and in Hawaiian and Niuean it is _loli_. But in the absence of agreement across high-order subgroups no generic can be attributed to POc.


<a id="s-5-3"></a>

### 5.3. Asteroidea: sea stars and Ophiuroidea: starfish


Oceanic languages usually distinguish by name a number of starfish. The sole POc term for starfish reconstructed so far continues a PMP etymon.

[PMP &ast;_saŋa-saŋa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-5-3-206-POc-saasaa-a)


<a id="p-207"></a>

Cushion stars, _Culcita_ spp., are plump, round starfish with short arms. No POc lexical form is recoverable but it is noteworthy that Marovo and the Fijian languages agree in naming cushion stars by expressions that mean ‘(possession) of a shark’; thus: Marovo _beibeiani te kiso_ (‘lit. ‘shark’s drinking water’), Bauan _kali ni qio_, Wayan _kali ni ikō_ (both lit. ‘shark’s pillow’). This suggests that the naming pattern is of POc antiquity, even though the forms are not cognate.


<a id="s-6"></a>

## 6. Cnidaria and Ctenophora: anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydroids


The phylum _Cnidaria_ (formerly _Coelenterata_) consists of four classes of animals: _Anthozoa_ (anemones and corals), _Scyphozoa_ (jellyfish), _Ctenophora_ (comb jellyfish) and _Hydrozoa_ (hydroids) which have nettle-like stinging hairs or tentacles used to capture prey.

There are two main classes of _Anthozoa_, (1) soft corals, colonial polyps having flexible skeletons that produce spicules of calcium carbonate, with feathery tentacles, and (2) stony corals and sea anemones, with tentacles in multiples of six. Stony corals have a hard skeleton. True anemones have no skeleton and a fleshy body, with circlets of tentacles, often brightly coloured, in contrast to colonial anemones which form a green mat on rocks and rubble.


<a id="s-6-1"></a>

### 6.1. Anemones


No POc term denoting anemones is reconstructable on present evidence. A problem is that few dictionaries of WOc languages provide a term for this group of animals. PROc _&ast;druman(e,i)_ ‘anemone’ has reflexes in North and Central Vanuatu, Fijian, Rotuman and Polynesian.

[PROc &ast;_druman(e,i)_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-6-1-207-PROc-drumanei-a)

_&ast;druman(e,i)_ has no certain antecedent in POc but may derive from POc _&ast;droman_ ‘leech’, with semantic change and addition of a final vowel. Note that the NCV reflexes of _&ast;droman_ show an initial high vowel and, in some cases, a labiovelar second consonant, pointing to PNCV _&ast;ruma_ ‘leech’.

<a id="p-208"></a>


<a id="s-6-2"></a>

### 6.2. Corals


Corals are colonies of small polyps which secrete a hard skeleton, forming a base on which the colony grows. Soft corals include sea fans, sea whips, sea feathers and sea blades. Hard corals include brain coral, staghorn coral and branching corals. Stony corals form a boulder, with the polyps emerging only at night. The distinctive brain corals are formed by coralettes clustering so close that they form sinuous valleys. Shallow underwater corals secrete limestone skeletons. The limestone is useful for a variety of purposes, including rubble for building house foundations and floors, and for making plaster. A rough, porous white coral is used as an abrasive in woodwork.

Oceanic languages generally have a generic name for living corals of the branching type and often distinguish several kinds. The Arosi dictionary lists eight different coral taxa, including six kinds of branching coral. However, dictionaries and wordlists seldom provide clear zoological identifications.

### 6.3. Scyphozoa, Ctenophora and Hydrozoa: true jellyfish, comb jellyfish and hydroids


<a id="fig-4-4_10"> </a>

[__Figure 4.10:__ _Physalis_ sp., Portuguese man o’ war](MediaTable#cldf:fig-4-4_10)



True jellyfish (_Scyphozoa_) are members of the _Cnidaria_, whose tentacles face down. They represent the medusa or free-swimming phase of _Scyphozoa_, preceding their polyp phase. _Ctenophora_, comb jellyfish, are colourless, oval blobs of jelly that float slowly. _Hydrozoa_ are polyps which form fuzz-like colonies on rocks, after a brief phase as a free-swimming organism. This group includes fire corals, hydroids and siphonophores. Hydroids are feathery colonial organisms growing on the surface of coral.

Oceanic languages often distinguish several different kinds of jellyfish, including the spectacular Portugese man o’ war or bluebottle (_Physalia physalia_) but no POc terms for any jellyfish taxa are recoverable. Two PPn terms for jellyfish are reconstructable. One, referring to the Portuguese man o’war, is well supported and has a cognate in Bauan Fijian, where it refers to a hydroid.

[PCP &ast;_bak(u)i_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-6-3-209-PCP-bakui-a)


<a id="p-210"></a>

[PPn &ast;_kalukalu_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-6-3-210-PPn-kalukalu-a)

A PSES term for anemone, or possibly jellyfish, is reconstructable which may be cognate with PPn _&ast;mama_ ‘chiton’ (see [§4.4](ContributionTable?anchor=s-4-4#cldf:4-4)).

[PSES &ast;_mama_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-6-3-210-PSES-mama-a)

The following PCP term may have denoted a kind of hydrozoa but the diversity of vague glosses given to its reflexes makes this uncertain.

[PCP &ast;_bulewa_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-6-3-210-PCP-bulewa-a)


<a id="s-7"></a>

## 7. Annelida: worms


Many annelid (segmented) worms live in tropical marine habitats. The two main groups are _Oligochaeta_ (with few bristles) and _Polychaeta_ (with many bristles). Marine worms are mainly _Polychaeta_ and include fireworms, feather duster worms, sphagetti worms, Christmas tree worms and bobbit or palolo worms. Reconstructions are available for just two marine worm taxa.


<a id="s-7-1"></a>

### 7.1. _Sipunculus_ sp., sandworm


[POc &ast;_ibo_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-7-1-210-POc-ibo-a)


<a id="p-211"></a>

Although this cognate set formally matches PMP _&ast;imbaw_ ‘marine mollusc sp.’ ([Blust 1980b](Source#cldf:Blust1980b): 77) the latter reconstruction rests on cognates in two WMP languages which both refer to bivalves.


<a id="s-7-2"></a>

### 7.2. Fireworms (Polychaeta)


Fireworms, 5-18 cm long, bear many white bristles along their sides which can cause itching when touched. They bear a superficial resemblance to centipedes and millipedes. A well-supported PMP and POc reconstruction for ‘centipede’ exists, namely _&ast;qalipan_, continued in PCP as _&ast;qaliva_ ‘millipede’. A separate term for ‘fireworm’, sometimes called ‘sea centipede’, is attributable to POc based on agreements between Saliba, a Papuan Tip language, and Polynesian witnesses. It appears that in PPn a single term, _&ast;weli_, was applied both to fireworms and to centipedes and furry millipedes. Glosses given to cognates in North-Central Vanuatu and Southeast Solomonic suggest that this range of reference may well have existed in POc.

[POc &ast;_weli_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-7-2-211-POc-weli-a)


<a id="p-212"></a>


<a id="s-7-3"></a>

### 7.3. Palolo worm (_Eunice viridis_, aka _Palola viridis_, _Leodis viridis_)


The palolo worm is distributed from Indonesia to the central Pacific. It burrows into coral. When spawning, the posterior end, filled with sperm and eggs, breaks off and swims to the surface. The annual spawning or ‘rise’, governed by the phase of the moon, occurs at regular times in the months October to December and at these times people scoop up the worms which are cooked and eaten.

A name for the palolo worm is attributable to PEOc, based on cognates shared by SES and NCV languages. The former reflect _&ast;odu_, the latter _&ast;udu_. The only known WOc cognate occurs in a Santa Isabel language, Maringe: _na-udu_, where _na-_ reflects the POC common noun marker _&ast;na_. The Maringe form may be a borrowing from a neighbouring SES language but it is noteworthy that its first vowel agrees with NCV rather than SES witnesses.

[4-4-7-3-212-mm-maringe-naudu](cf.csv#cldf:4-4-7-3-212-mm-maringe-naudu)

[PEOc &ast;_(o,u)du_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-7-3-212-PEOc-oudu-a)

A separate term is reconstructable for PCP, with reflexes in Fijian and Polynesian languages.

## 8. Poriphera: sponges


Sponges are conspicuous inhabitants of coral reefs. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, attaching themselves wherever they can find a space. Some Oceanic languages have a general term for sponges, e.g. Lau _losi_, _lo-losi_, Gela _loi-losi_, Roviana _puha_, Dobuan _halu_, Motu _puta_, Sa’a _hulo_, but no widespread cognate sets have been noted, other than the following from Polynesian languages.

[PPn &ast;_oma_](cognatesetreferences.csv#cldf:4-4-8-None-213-PPn-oma-a)


<a id="s-9"></a>

## 9. What proportion of POc taxa have been reconstructed?


Leaving aside the collective term _&ast;pinaŋoda_, the number of fairly secure POc reconstructions for aquatic (including semi-aquatic) invertebrate taxa is 42, with a few additional tentative reconstructions at POc level and a number of other reconstructions attributable to PEOc or PWOc. Taking the Wayan figure of about 240 taxa as fairly typical of those Austronesian maritime communities which exploit fringing reefs and mangrove swamps, it follows that 42 is probably less than a fifth of the total number of aquatic taxa distinguished by POc speakers. The breakdown in [Table 4.2](#table-4.2), comparing Wayan with POc, indicates the distribution of the shortfalls across the main groups of aquatic invertebrates.

The relative paucity of POc reconstructions can be attributed in large part to gaps in the coverage provided by dictionaries of contemporary languages. Few dictionaries give anything like an exhaustive listing of terms for invertebrates. However, a pattern is discernable in the kinds of terms that can/cannot be reconstructed. One important category of terms almost completely missing from our reconstructions is binomials. A run through the list of reconstructions shows that all the POc terms are uninomials (unitary lexemes). By contrast, about a third of the Wayan names are binomials, including 40 of the 105 gastropod taxa, but only seven of the 35 bivalve taxa.

Why are uninomials more stable than binomials? [Berlin](Source#cldf:Berlin1992) ([1992](Source#cldf:Berlin1992)) argues that in folk taxonomies of wild animals and plants the most salient and well-marked categories for purposes of identification are folk generics (see [ch. 8, §1.2.3](ContributionTable?anchor=s-1-2-3#cldf:4-8)). Names of taxa at the level of folk generic are usually uninominals (e.g. English _owl_, _whale_, _oak_, _willow_) or idioms, e.g. _blackbird_, _she-oak_, _pussy willow_). A folk generic may have a number of folk specifics, which are perceived as closely related but distinct types. These are typically known by binomials, made up of a folk generic plus a descriptive modifier which refers to one or another distinguishing feature of the taxon - its characteristic habitat, colour, size, shape, etc., e.g. _barn owl_, _grass owl_, _sooty owl_, _hump-backed whale_, _blue whale_. Folk generics commonly fall under high-order taxa, particularly the type that Berlin calls a life-form, such as English _fish_, _bird_, _snake_, and _tree_. Sometimes levels between life-form and folk generic are distinguished and Berlin calls these intermediates.

<a id="p-215"></a>

The POc terms for aquatic invertebrates that have survived are exclusively generics of some sort, either folk generics or high-order generics. The modifiers that distinguish folk specifics have not been stable. There are, perhaps, several reasons why modifiers are unstable. One is the variability of local species. Although the same orders, families and genera of common reef and shoreline animals are usually common to different regions of the tropical Pacific, the species are more variable from region to region. Migrants might be expected to apply new modifiers to newly encountered species if these were clearly distinct from those known in their former homeland. Another factor is the wide range of distinctive characteristics exhibited by certain species and genera of the same family, such as colour, shape, size and behaviour. Speakers can be expected from time to time to change the choice of the characteristic used to distinguish one taxon terminologically from its sister taxa. Finally, particular modifying terms may themselves be replaced by synonyms which come into favour, sometimes leading to loss or change of meaning in the original modifier.

Some groups of invertebrates show a much higher ratio of taxa reconstructed to POc level than others, when compared with Wayan totals. Among the crustaceans, the Anomura (hermit crabs) have a high ratio with 4/4, whereas the Brachyura (true crabs) score only 7/33. Prawns and shrimps score much lower (1/7), the sole POc term reconstructed being the generic for prawns and lobsters. Sea cucumbers and sea urchins also show a very low ratio: three POc reconstructions compared with 27 taxa distinguished in Wayan. The cephalopods (3/4) have by far the highest ratios among the molluscs. The bivalves (10/35) score much higher than the gastropods (7/105), a difference not solely attributable to the fact that binomials make up 40 of the 105 Wayan gastropod names but only 7 of the 35 bivalve names.

These ratios can be taken as a very rough measure of how persistent POc names have been for particular invertebrate groups: a high score for POc indicates a high retention rate of terms in daughter languages, a low score the converse. Very likely there is a correlation between how persistent a term is, and how salient or important the referent is to to members of the speech community. Of course, a creature can be salient for any of a number of reasons: economic importance, large size, unusual appearance, being dangerous, and so on. Closer study of such matters must be left for another occasion.


## Notes

[^1]: This is a much revised and expanded version of Pawley (1996). I am grateful to Meredith Osmond for help in compiling and checking the list of cognate sets, and to Ann Chowning. John Lynch and Malcolm Ross for valuable comments on a draft of the paper. I am also indebted to Ann Chowning for data on some New Britain languages, to Paul Geraghty for providing terms from the Viwa dialect of Wayan Fijian and for helpful discussion of the Wayan material and to John Lynch for comparative material on Southern Vanuatu languages.

[^2]: In these two reconstructions I have substituted _&ast;d_ for the POc phoneme that Clark writes as _&ast;nt_.

[^3]: With respect to ‘shellfish’, much used in dictionary' and wordlist glosses cited for this and certain other cognate sets, it should be noted that this term means different things to different people. Nearly all New Zealanders and many Australians and English people use ‘shellfish’ to mean ‘(edible) molluscs with external shells’, excluding crustaceans, whereas others, including most people from the USA, use it to mean ‘(edible) crustaceans and molluscs with external shells’. It is apparent that most of our sources for Oceanic languages use this term in the narrower sense.

[^4]: These numbers refer to terminal taxa, i.e. excluding higher-order taxa (generic terms with two or more subtaxa), and counting only one item for each set of synonyms or variant forms. Numbers are necessarily approximate because of disagreements among informants, the uncertain status of some descriptive binomials, and other factors.

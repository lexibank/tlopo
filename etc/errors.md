# Errors noted in the volumes

## Volume 1

A footnote in vol 2 notes:
> In vol. 1, p.189 the form POc *ijuŋ ‘projecting headboard of prow’ is erroneously given for *(i,u)cuŋ. 

A footnote in vol 2 notes:
> In vol. 1, p.139 the form PCP *pusi is erroneously given for *vusi 

Volume 3 notes:
> PWOc *(m,mʷ)ali (incorrectly given as *maRi in vol. 1, ch.8, §7)

A footnote in vol 3 says
> In vol.1, ch.S, §8, the reconstructed form is _*(d)rama(R)_, but initial _*dr-_ (as opposed to _*r-_) is not required by the data.

Vol 5 says
> A reconstruction here labelled ‘PROc’ was in volume 1 or 2 labelled ‘PEOc’, but if its supporting data include no SE Solomonic reflexes, it has the same status as a PROc reconstruction in volumes 3 and 4 and the present volume.

Vol 5 says in the section "carrying on a canoe":
> In vol.1 (p198) it was inferred that Oceanic items reflected POc _*lujan_, and _*ujan_. With a better understanding of Oceanic sound correspondences, _*Rujan_ is inferred here, rather that _*lujan_

Vol 5 says
> A verb for slapping, POc _*pʷasa(r,R)_, _*pʷasa(r,R)-i-_ ‘slap, hit’, was reconstructed in vol.1:273. With considerably more data the form and gloss of the reconstruction can be edited as shown below.

A footnote in vol 5 says
> Tolo _vuli-_ ‘wash (hands, clothes)’ was attributed to POc _*pulu_ in vol.1:243, instead of to _*puRiq_.


## Volume 2

Vol 3 states 
> The reconstruction of POc _*maRaŋo_ 'coconut growth stage 9: ripe, flesh hardened (or stage 10: dry and ready to fall)' entails a phonological problem. I assumed in vol. 2 (ch.7, §5.6) that reflexes of this term were cognate with reflexes of POc _*[ma]raŋo_ 'become withered (of vegetation)', reconstructed by Osmond in vol. 1 (ch.5, §9.4). I assumed further that both reflected PMP _*(ma)Raŋaw_ and that the POc form was _*[ma]Raŋo_, regularly reflecting the PMP form. As I noted in vol.2, this is problematic, as Southeast Solomonic reflexes of the form _raŋo_ 'be withered' reflect POc _*r_, not _*R_. On balance the data now available suggest that my assumption in vol. 2 was wrong, and that two POc reconstructions must be made: POc _*[ma]raŋo_ 'become withered (of vegetation)', as reconstructed by Osmond, and _*maRaŋo_ 'coconut growth stage …'.

A footnote in vol 5 says
> In vol.2:.111 PPn _*awa_ was incorrectly listed as a reflex of POc _*sawa(n,ŋ)_ ‘channel, passage’ with unexplained loss of _*s-_.

A footnote in vol 5 says
> The reconstruction in vol.2 (p97) is _*puso_. but the external evidence suggests _*puco(q)_.

Vol 5 has revisions of reconstructions in vol 2:
> A consequence of this is that §§4.8.1–2 are revisions of the section on temperature in vol. 2:217–218—this despite the fact that those terms were concerned with (b), whereas we are here concerned with (a). Although it may be assumed that POc made distinctions of the kind listed above, it is not possible to determine accurately how reconstructed terms for ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ related to (a), (b) and (c).
 
- A footnote in vol 5 says
  > In vol.2:212, _*[t,d]onu(p)_ ‘straight’ was reconstructed. The PT reflexes now show that the final consonant was _*-q_.

## Volume 5

vol 6 says:
> POc _*qata(r)_ ‘soul, spirit; shadow, reflection’ was reconstructed with POc final _*(-r)_ in vol.5:205, following Dempwolff’s (1938:60) PMP _*qantad_. In vol.5 the PMP term was wrongly glossed ‘appearance, mark’. Dempwolff glosses it ‘be visible’. With this gloss it is an unlikely antecedent of POc _*qata_ ‘soul …’. The latter is distinct from the homophonous POc _*qata_ ‘person’ (vol.5:46).

A footnote in vol 6 says
> In vol.5:80 this is reconstructed as _*tubu-a(ŋ)_. The MM reflexes above show that the final consonant was _*-n_ and that the term is reconstructable with this meaning as far back as POc.

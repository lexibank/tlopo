ancestral Oceanic society.

Volume 6 – People: society

Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond

People: society is the sixth and last volume in the series of six volumes of The lexicon of
Proto Oceanic, the ancestor of the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family.
Earlier volumes are: vol.1 Material Culture, vol. 2 The physical environment, vol. 3
Plants, Vol. 4 Animals and Vol. 5 People: body and mind. The present volume begins by
listing the titles of the chapters of all six volumes.

Volume 6 begins with a general introduction to the series in Chapter 1, along with new
findings about the origin of Proto Oceanic itself. Chapter 2 is a detailed reconstruction
of Proto Oceanic (POc) kinship terms and structures. Chapter 3, by the late Per Hage,
uses evidence from various disciplines to answer the question, “Was POc society
matrilineal?” The POc terms for chieftainship and rank, and what can be gleaned from
them about POc speakers’ social structure, are the topic of Chapter 4. Reconstructed
terms are employed in Chapter 5 to investigate POc speakers’ settlement patterns.
Chapter 6 concerns POc speakers’ probable recreational activities: music, song, dance
and games. Their belief system provides the topics of chapters 7 to 10: the spirit
world, magic, mana and tabu. Chapter 11 investigates how Oceanic speakers referred to
the seasonal cycle and their use of the sun, moon and stars to regulate agricultural activity.
Chapter 12 deals with the terms POc speakers used to refer to various aspects of
speech. Terms to do with trade and with change of possession—giving, receiving and
stealing—are the subject of Chapter 13. It also introduces ceremonial exchange
practices, which play a role in chapter 14 on the POc decimal counting system and
numeral classifiers. Chapter 15 suggests that POc speakers may also have used a digit-
tally system for everyday counting. Finally, Chapter 16 deals with the subset of
numeral classifiers used in measurement. Appendices list data sources and the
languages mentioned in the volume, along with various kinds of information about
them.

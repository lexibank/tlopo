1 Introduction

1.1 Aims

   This is the first of a set of five volumes bringing together the results of recent work on the
lexicon of the Proto Oceanic (POc) language.[1] Volume 1 deals with material culture, volume
2 with the physical world including landscape and conceptions of location, meteorology,
astronomy and time, volume 3 with flora and fauna, volume 4 with terminologies centring on
human beings, including the body and basic human conditions and activities, and social
organisation, and volume 5 with grammatical (closed) categories including adjectives, pronouns,
and number. Volume 5, as it is planned at the time of writing, will also include an index to
the POc and other reconstructions presented in the whole work, as well as an English-to-POc
finderlist and a list of all languages cited, together with their subgroups.

   Proto Oceanic is the immediate ancestor of the Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian
language family (see Map 1). This subgroup consists of all the Austronesian languages of
Melanesia east of 136°E, together with those of Polynesia and (with two exceptions) those of
Micronesia - more than 450 languages in all.[2] Extensive arguments for the existence of
Oceanic as a clearly demarcated branch of Austronesian were first put forward by Otto
Dempwolff in the 1920s (cf. Ch. 2, §2.4) and the validity of the subgroup is now recognised
by virtually all scholars working in Austronesian historical linguistics.

   The development and break-up of the POc language and speech community were stages in
a truly remarkable chapter in human prehistory - the colonisation by Austronesian speakers
of the Indo-Pacific region in the period after about 3000 BC. The outcome was the largest of
the world's well-established language families and (until the expansion of Indo-European
after Columbus) the most widespread. The Austronesian family comprises around 1,000
distinct languages. Its eastern and western outliers, Madagascar and Easter Island, are two-thirds
of a world apart, and its northernmost extensions, Hawaii and Taiwan, are separated by 70
degrees of latitude from its southernmost outpost, Stewart Island in New Zealand.

   It is likely that the divergence of Oceanic from its nearest relatives, which are the Austronesian
languages spoken around Cenderawasih Bay and in South Halmahera (Blust 1978a), began
when Austronesian speakers from the Cenderawasih Bay area moved eastwards along the
north coast of New Guinea or into the Bismarck Archipelago. There is a strong school of
opinion that associates the subsequent break-up of POc with the rapid colonisation of Island
Melanesia and the central Pacific by bearers of the Lapita culture between about 1500 and
 1000 BC (see Map 2).[3]

   The present project aims to bring together a large corpus of lexical reconstructions for
POc, together with supporting cognate sets, organised according to semantic fields and using
a standard orthography for POc. The symposium entitled
_Austronesian terminologies: continuity and change_ held at the Australian National University
in October 1990 showed
that there was considerable interest among scholars in such a project (the proceedings were
published as Pawley & Ross 1994).

   We hope that this thesaurus will be a useful resource for culture historians, archaeologists
and others interested in the prehistory of the Pacific region.[4] The comparative lexical material
should also be a rich source of data for various kinds of purely linguistic research, e.g. on
semantic change and subgrouping in the more than 400 daughter languages.

[1] The project has been jointly directed by Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross, with research assistance from
Meredith Osmond, in the Department of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the
Australian National University.

[2] The listing in Tryon ed. (1995) contains 466 Oceanic languages, many of which are subdivisible into
dialects.

[3] For accounts of this colonisation from archaeological and linguistic viewpoints respectively, see
Bellwood (1978, 1987), Green (1979), Kirch (1997), Kirch and Hunt (1988), Pawley and Ross (1995), and
Spriggs (1995). Pawley and Green (1984), Pawley and Ross (1993), and Ross (1995b) provide accounts of
various aspects of the spread of Austronesian speakers into the Pacific in the wider context of the
Austronesian dispersal as a whole.

[4] The proper relationship between the three disciplines in doing prehistory is a controversial matter.
In Ch. 3, §1, Green and Pawley discuss (and adopt) the approach of the culture historian in drawing on
diverse lines of evidence. In Ch. 7, § 1, Pawley and Pawley discuss the important distinction between the
comparative typological method of historical reconstruction, drawing on ethnographic evidence, and the
genetic comparative method used by historical linguists.


1.2 The relation of the current project to previous work

   Reconstructions of POc phonology and lexicon began with Dempwolff's pioneering work
in the 1920s and 1930s. Dempwolff's dictionary of reconstructions attributed to 'PAn'
(Dempwolff 1938) - but equivalent in modern terms to 'PMP' - contains some 600
reconstructions with reflexes in Oceanic languages.

   Since the 1950s, POc and other early Oceanic interstage languages have been the subject
of a considerable body of research. However, relatively few new reconstructions safely
attributable to POc were added to Dempwolff's material until the 1970s. In 1969 George
Grace made available as a working paper a compilation of reconstructions from various
sources amounting to some 700 distinct items, attributed either to POc or to early Oceanic
interstages. These materials were presented in a new orthography for POc, based largely on
Biggs' (1965) orthography for an interstage he called Proto Eastern Oceanic. Updated
compilations of Oceanic cognate sets were produced at the University of Hawaii in the period
1977-1983 as part of a project directed by Grace and Pawley. These compilations and the
supporting data are problematic in various respects and we have made only limited use of
them.


                                                                                Introduction      3

    Comparative lexical studies have been carried out for several lower-order subgroups of
Oceanic: for Proto Polynesian by Biggs (resulting in Walsh and Biggs (1966),
Biggs et al. (1970) and subsequent versions of the POLLEX file, including Biggs (1993), the version we
have referred to in our work); for Proto Micronesian by scholars at the University of Hawaii
(Bender et al. 1983); for Proto North/Central Vanuatu by Clark (1994); for Proto Southern
Vanuatu by Lynch (1978b, 1996b); for New Caledonia by Ozanne-Rivierre (1992), Haudricourt
and Ozanne-Rivierre (1982) and Geraghty (1989); for Proto Southeast Solomonic by Levy (1980, n.d.)
and Lichtenberk (1988); for Proto Central Pacific by Hockett (1976) and
Geraghty (1983, 1986, 1994 and 1996, together with a number of unpublished papers); for Proto
Eastern Oceanic by Biggs (1965), Cashmore (1969), Levy and Smith (1970), and Geraghty (1990);
and for Proto Central Papuan by Pawley (1975), Lynch (1978a, 1980), and (Ross 1994a).

   Robert Blust (1970, 1980b, 1983-84a, 1986, 1989) of the University of Hawaii has, in a
series of papers published extensive, alphabetically ordered, lexical reconstructions (with
supporting cognate sets) for interstages earlier than POc, especially for Proto Austronesian,
Proto Malayo-Polynesian and Proto Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. He has also written several
papers investigating specific semantic fields (Blust 1980a, 1982, 1987, 1994). At the time of
writing, Blust is in the process of compiling his Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (ACD)
on disk at the University of Hawaii. The version to which we refer dates from 1995.

   Several papers systematically investigate particular semantic domains in the lexicon of
POc, e.g. Milke (1958), French-Wright (1983), Pawley (1982a), Pawley and Green (1985),
Lichtenberk (1986), Walter (1989), and the various papers in Pawley and Ross (1994). Ross (1988)
contains a substantial number of new POc lexical reconstructions, as well as proposed
modifications to the reconstructed POc sound system and the orthography.

   These earlier works have provided valuable points of reference, both inside and outside the
Oceanic group, and we are indebted particularly to Biggs (1993), Clark (1994) and Blust (ACD).
However, previous Oceanic lexical studies were limited both by large gaps in the data,
with a distinct bias in favour of 'Eastern Oceanic' languages, and by the technical problems
of collating large quantities of data. Although most languages in Melanesia remain poorly
described, there are now many more dictionaries and extended word lists, particularly for
Papua New Guinea, than there were ten years ago. And developments in computing hardware
and software now permit much faster and more precise handling of data than was possible
even five years ago. A list of sources and a summary of the Project's collation procedures is
found in Appendix 1.

   As the present project proceeded, we came to realise that the form in which preliminary
publications were presented - namely as essays, each discussing a particular terminology at
some length - would also be the best form for the presentation of our final synthesis. A
discursive treatment of individual terminologies, as opposed, say, to a dictionary-type listing
of reconstructions with supporting cognate sets, makes it easier to relate the linguistic
comparisons to relevant issues of culture history, language change, and methodology. Hence
each of the present volumes is a collection of essays, each paper presenting the reconstruction
of a POc terminology. Some of these have been published or presented elsewhere, but are
printed here in revised form. Sections dealing with theoretical considerations common to all
the papers have been edited out and these matters are instead dealt with once, in this Introduction.
Different contributors followed somewhat different conventions in their initial publications,
and these have been edited to conform with the conventions outlined above. In some cases we
have updated the earlier versions in the light of subsequent research, and, where appropriate,
have inserted cross-references between contributions. Authorship is in some cases something
of a problem, as a number of people have had a hand in collating the data, doing the
reconstructions, and (re)writing for publication here. In most papers, however, one person did
the research which determined the structure of the terminology, and that person appears as
the first or only author, and where another or others had a substantial part in putting together
the paper itself, they appear as the second and further authors. Meredith Osmond, the project's
research assistant, played an important role in collating the cognate sets of most papers, and
all contributions have undergone a rather greater degree of editorial adjustment by all three
editors than would otherwise be normal in a composite volume.

1.3 Reconstructing the lexicon

   The lexical reconstructions presented in these volumes are arrived at using the standard
methods of comparative linguistics, which require as preliminaries a theory of subgrouping
(§3.2) and the working out of systematic sound correspondences among cognate vocabulary
in contemporary languages (§3.3). As well as cognate sets clearly attributable to Proto Oceanic,
we have included some cognate sets which at this stage are attributable to various interstage
languages, particularly Proto Western and Proto Eastern Oceanic (but see below for definitions).
We have set out to pay more careful attention to reconstructing the semantics of Proto
Oceanic forms than has generally been done in earlier work, treating words not as isolates but
as parts of terminologies.


1.3.1 Terminological reconstruction

    Our method of doing 'terminological reconstruction' is as follows. First, the terminologies
of present-day speakers of Oceanic languages are used as the basis for constructing a hypothesis
about the semantic structure of a corresponding POc terminology, taking account of (i)
ethnographic evidence, i.e. descriptions of the lifestyles of Oceanic communities and (ii) the
geographical and physical resources of particular regions of Oceania. For example, by
comparing terms in several languages for parts of an outrigger canoe, or for growth stages of
a coconut, one can see which concepts recur and so are likely to have been present in POc.
Secondly, a search is made for cognate sets from which forms can be reconstructed to match
each meaning in this hypothesised terminology. The search is not restricted to members of the
Oceanic subgroup; if a term found in an Oceanic language proves to have external (non-Oceanic)
cognates, the POc antiquity of that term will be confirmed and additional evidence concerning
its meaning will be provided. Thirdly, the hypothesised terminology is re-examined to see if it
needs modification in the light of the reconstructions. There are cases, highlighted in the
various contributions to these volumes, where we were able to reconstruct a term where we
did not expect to do so and conversely, often more significantly, where we were unable to
reconstruct a term where we had believed we should be able to. In each case, we have
discussed the reasons why our expectations were not met and what this may mean for
Oceanic culture history.

    Blust (1987: 81) distinguishes between conventional 'semantic reconstruction', which asks,
"What was the probable meaning of protomorpheme X?", and Dyen and Aberle's (1974)
'lexical reconstruction', where one asks, "What was the protomorpheme which probably
meant 'X'?" At first sight, it might appear that terminological reconstruction is a version of
lexical reconstruction. However, there are sharp differences. Lexical reconstruction applies a
formal procedure: likely protomeanings are selected from among the glosses of words in
available cognate sets, then an algorithm is applied to determine which meaning should be
attributed to each set. This procedure may have unsatisfactory results, as Blust points out.
Several reconstructions may end up with the same meaning; or no meaning may be reconstructed
for a form because none of the glosses of its reflexes is its protomeaning.

                                                                               Introduction      5

   Terminological reconstruction is instead similar to the semantic reconstruction approach.
In terminological reconstruction the meanings of protomorphemes are not determined in
advance. Instead, cognate sets are collected and their meanings are compared with regard to:

__ul__
their specific denotations, where these are known;
the geographic and genetic distribution of these denotations (i.e. are the glosses from which the protogloss is reconstructed well distributed?);
any derivational relationships to other reconstructions;
their place within a working hypothesis of the relevant POc terminology (e.g., are terms complementary -'bow' implies 'arrow'; 'seine net' implies 'floats' and 'weights'? Are there different levels of classification-generic, specific, and so on?).

For example, it proved possible to reconstruct the following POc terms for tying with cords
(Ch. 9, §10):

__ul__
POc *buku 'tie (a knot); fasten'
POc *pʷita 'tie by encircling'
POc *paqu(s), *paqus-i- 'bind, lash; construct (canoe +) by lashing together'
POc *pisi 'bind up, tie up, wind round, wrap'
POc *kiti 'tie, bind'

In each of the supporting cognate sets from contemporary languages there are a number of
items whose glosses in the dictionaries or word lists are too vague to tell the analyst anything
about the specific denotation of the item, and in the case of _*kiti_ this prevents the assignment
of a more specific meaning. The verb _*buku_ can be identified as the generic term for tying a
knot because of its derivational relationship (by zero derivation) with a noun whose denotation
is clearly generic, _*buku_ 'node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood,
string or rope' (Ch. 4, §3.2). Reconstruction of the meaning of _*pʷita_ as 'tie by encircling' is
supported by the meanings of the Lukep, Takia and Longgu reflexes, respectively 'tie by
encircling', 'tie on (as grass-skirt)' and 'trap an animal's leg; tie s.t. around ankle or wrist':
Lukep and Takia are North New Guinea languages, whilst Longgu is Southeast Solomonic.
Reconstruction of the meaning of _*paqu(s)_, _*paqus-i-_ as 'bind, lash; construct (canoe +) by
tying together' is supported by the meanings of the Takia, Kiribati and Samoan reflexes,
respectively 'tie, bind; construct (a canoe)', 'construct (canoe, house)', and 'make, construct
(wooden objects, canoes +)': Takia is a North New Guinea language, Kiribati is Micronesian,
and Samoan is Polynesian. The meaning of *pisi is similarly reconstructed by reference to
the meanings of its Mono-Alu, Mota, Port Sandwich, Nguna and Fijian reflexes.

   Often, however, the contributors of these chapters have been less fortunate in the information
available to them. For example, Osmond (Ch. 8, § 9) reconstructs six POc terms broadly
glossed as 'spear'. Multiple terms for implements within one language imply that these items
were used extensively and possibly in specialised ways. Can we throw light on these specialised
ways? Unfortunately, some of the word lists and dictionaries available give minimal
glosses - 'spear' or 'net'. What we need to know is: what is the level of reference? Is it a term
for all spears, or perhaps all pointed projectiles including arrows and darts? Or does it refer to
a particular kind of spear? Is it noun or verb or both? If a noun, does it refer to both the
instrument and the activity? Most word lists are frustratingly short on detail. For this kind of
detail, ethnographies have proved a more fruitful source of information than many word lists.

Note: Italics are used to indicate a group of languages or a language which have no exclusively shared
common ancestor. Thus Formosan languages indicates a collection of languages descended (along with Proto
Malayo-Polynesian) from Proto Austronesian. It is assumed that there was no 'Proto Formosan'.

                                                                                      Introduction        7

   Another problem is inherent in the dangers of sampling from over 450 languages. The
greater the number of languages, the greater are the possible variations in meaning of any
given term, and the greater the chances of two languages making the same semantic leaps
quite independently. Does our (sometimes quite limited) cognate set provide us with a clear
unambiguous gloss, or have we picked up an accidental bias, a secondary or distantly related
meaning? Did etymon x refer to fishhook or the material from which the fishhook was made?
Did etymon y refer to the slingshot or to the action of turning round and round?


1.3.2 Subgrouping and reconstruction

   The strength of a lexical reconstruction rests crucially on the distribution of the supporting
cognate sets across subgroups. The distribution of cognate forms and agreements in their
meanings is much more important than the number of cognates. It is enough to make a
secure reconstruction if a cognate set occurs in just two languages in a family, with agreement
in meaning, provided that the two languages belong to different first-order subgroups and
provided that there is no reason to suspect that the resemblances are due to borrowing or
chance. The PMP term _*apij_ 'twins' is reflected in several Western Malayo-Polynesian
languages (e.g. Batak _apid_ 'twins, double (fused) banana') but in only a single Oceanic
language (Roviana _avisi_ 'twins of the same sex'). Because Roviana belongs to a different
first-order branch of Malayo-Polynesian from the Western Malayo-Polynesian witnesses and
because there is virtually no chance that the agreement is due to borrowing or chance similarity,
this distribution is enough to justify the reconstruction of PMP and POc _*apij_ 'twins'.

    Although the subgrouping of Austronesian languages and questions about which
protolanguage was spoken where remain somewhat controversial, it is impossible to proceed
without making some assumptions about these matters. Figure 1 is an approximate rendering
of our subgrouping assumptions, and also serves as a key to abbreviations of names of
language groups and protolanguages. The upper part of the tree (as far down as POc) is due
to Blust, originally presented in Blust (1977a) and repeated with additional supporting evidence
in subsequent publications (Blust 1978a, 1982, 1983-84b, 1993).[5]

    Within Oceanic we assume a minimum of three primary subgroups: Western Oceanic,
Admiralties (Adm), and Eastern Oceanic (see Map 3). Western Oceanic and Admiralties are
reasonably well founded, and have been defined by Ross (1988). The St Matthias group, also
a possible primary subgroup (represented here only by Mussau), is here included with
Admiralties.[6] Eastern Oceanic ('Central/Eastern Oceanic' in the terminology of Ross 1994b)
includes all other Oceanic languages.[7] Eastern Oceanic does not meet normal subgrouping
criteria (i.e. no shared innovations define the whole group), but treating them as a unit ensures
a rigorous criterion for recognising a reconstruction as POc: it must have reflexes in at least
two of the subgroups that are generally regarded as primary, or possibly primary, branches of
Oceanic.[8] Both here and at the interstages described below, no reconstruction is made if there
are grounds to infer borrowing from one subgroup to another.[9] Occasionally, we make use of
data from Yapese, which may also be a single-member primary subgroup of Oceanic (Ross 1996a),
but we have not treated it as a subgroup for the purpose of reconstruction (i.e.
reflexes of an etymon in Yapese and in just one of the three primary subgroups listed above
would not be enough to justify a reconstruction).

[5]  For a commentary on Austronesian subgrouping, see Ross (1995b).

[6]  On the position of Mussau, see Ross (1988:315-316, 331) .

[7]  The term 'Eastern Oceanic' has been used in different ways by various authors. Ours is more
inclusive than most, resembling more closely the "Central/Eastern Oceanic" set up by
Lynch and Tryon (1983). The published version of the latter (1985), presents a less inclusive
version of Central/Eastern Oceanic.

Map 3: Higher-order subgroups of Oceanic languages used in this work for the purposes of reconstruction

                                                                                           Introduction        9


   The Western Oceanic languages seem to be the outcome of the gradual and complex
diversification of an old dialect network. It could be argued that these languages have no
exclusively shared protolanguage other than POc (this is the approach of Ross 1994b), but
there are enough innovations in the lexicon and elsewhere to suggest that the original Western
Oceanic dialect network was quite compact, and we treat it here as a unitary protolanguage,
Proto Western Oceanic.

   Western Oceanic in turn consists of the North New Guinea (NNG), Papuan Tip (PT) and
Meso-Melanesian (MM) clusters and the Sarmi/Jayapura (SJ) group (see Map 4). The last-named
may belong to the NNG cluster, but this is uncertain (Ross 1996b). It is possible that the NNG
and PT clusters form a super-cluster, New Guinea Oceanic, and so etyma which occur only in
NNG and PT languages are attributed to a putative Proto New Guinea Oceanic (PNGOc), and
etyma found in either NNG or PT (or both) and also in MM are labelled Proto Western
Oceanic (PWOc).

   The Admiralties subgroup is treated as having no internal subgrouping. The Eastern Oceanic
subgroup is assumed to consist of Southeast Solomonic (SES), North/Central Vanuatu (NCV),
South Vanuatu (SV), New Caledonia (NCal), Nuclear Micronesian (Mic), and Central Pacific
(divided for convenience into Fijian [Fij] and Polynesian [Pn]) (see Map 3). Reflexes in any
two of these groups are enough to justify reconstruction of a Proto Eastern Oceanic (PEOc)
etymon.[10]

   As noted above, it is likely that Eastern Oceanic is not a primary subgroup, but a collection
of primary subgroups resulting from the very rapid dispersal of POc speakers (Pawley & Ross 1995).

   We ask the reader to be mindful of the fact that we have provided this diagram as an aid
to presentation: as soon as one draws a tree diagram, one has to choose among alternative
hypotheses and draw all nodes as if they were equally well supported. This is far from the
case. One can find more convincing evidence for some parts of this tree than for others, and,
although these differences are not important to our reconstructions, we would not wish Figure 1
to be taken as a definitive representation of our current assumptions about Oceanic
subgrouping.

[8] A result of this process is that much of the data available to us remains unused because it cannot be
     attributed to a cognate set. An increase in available dictionaries would probably allow more cognate
     sets to be identified and, therefore, more reconstructions to be made, but it is reasonable to assume
     that there would always be a large proportion of the available data which would not fall into cognate
     sets because of the vocabulary innovation which goes on in all languages, although at varying speeds.

[9] Cases where such an inference can be made in regard to primary subgroups occur mostly at the boundary
     (in the Solomon Islands) between WOc and EOc. Where an etymon occurs (1) in WOc and only in the
     Southeast Solomonic languages of EOc or (2) in EOc and only in the Northwest Solomonic languages of
     WOc, borrowing is likely (and is often reflected in unexpected sound correspondences).

[10] This subgrouping may well prove to be somewhat inaccurate, especially with regard to North/Central
     Vanuatu (see Lynch (1995), but will not invalidate any reconstructions made here. The 'Fijian'
     grouping is used only for presentational purposes, and is not assumed to be a discrete subgroup
     within Central Pacific.

      Languages from which data are cited in this volume are listed in Appendix 2 in their
subgroups, together with an index allowing the reader to find the subgroup to which a given
language belongs.


1.3.3 Sound correspondences

    As we noted above, reconstruction depends on working out the systematic sound
correspondences among cognate vocabulary in contemporary languages and on having a
working hypothesis about how the sounds of Proto Oceanic have changed and are reflected in
modern Oceanic languages. Working out sound correspondences even for twenty languages is
a large task, and so we have relied heavily on our own previous work and the work of others.
The sound correspondences we have used are those given by Ross (1988) for Western
Oceanic and Admiralties; by Levy (1979, 1980) and Lichtenberk (1988) for Cristobal-Malaitan,
by Pawley (1972) and Tryon and Hackman (1983) for Southeast Solomonic; by Tryon (1976) and
Clark (1994) for North/Central Vanuatu; by Lynch (1978b, 1996b) for South
Vanuatu; by Geraghty (1989) and Ozanne-Rivierre (1992) for New Caledonia; by Jackson (1986)
and Ross (1996a) for Nuclear Micronesian; by Geraghty (1986) for Central Pacific;
by Biggs (1978) for Polynesian; by Ross (1996a) for Yapese; and by Ross (1996b) for Irian
Jaya.

   For non-Oceanic languages we have referred to sound correspondences given by Tsuchida (1976)
for Formosa; by Zorc (1977, 1986) and Reid (1982) for the Philippines; by Adelaar (1992a) and
Nothofer (1975) for Malay and Javanese; by Sneddon (1984) for Sulawesi; by
Collins (1983) for Central Maluku; and by Blust (1978a) for South Halmahera and Irian
Jaya.

   We are well aware that regular sound correspondences can be interfered with in various
ways: by phonetic conditioning that the analyst has not identified (see, e.g., Blust 1996a), by
borrowing (for an extreme Oceanic case, see Grace 1996), or, as recent research suggests, by
the frequency of an item's use (Bybee 1994). We have tried at least to note, and sometimes to
account for, irregularities in cognate sets.


1.3.4 Proto Oceanic phonology

   Work based on the sound correspondences of both Oceanic and non-Oceanic languages
has resulted in the following reconstructed paradigm of POc phonemes:

1.4 Conventions

1.4.1 Chapter format

    Each of the contributions to the present volumes (except Chapter 2 of this volume)
concerns a particular Proto Oceanic 'terminology'. Generally, each contribution begins with an
introduction to the issues raised by the reconstruction of its particular terminology, and the
bulk of each contribution consists of reconstructed etyma with supporting data and a
commentary on matters of meaning and form. In the interests of space, we have not given the
history of the reconstructions themselves, as this would often require commentary on the
modifications made by others and by us, and on why we have made them. Where a reconstruction
is not new, we have tried to give its earliest source, but this is difficult when earlier
reconstructions differ in form and meaning from ours, so the decision as to whether a
particular reconstruction is 'new' is rather subjective.

    In general, the contributions to these volumes are concerned with items reconstructable in
POc, PWOc, PEOc and occasionally PNGOc. Etyma for PWOc, PNGOc and PEOc are
reconstructed because these may well also be POc etyma for which known reflexes are not
well distributed. The contributors to this volume vary in the degree to which they reconstruct
etyma for interstages further down the tree. Reconstructions for lower-order interstages are
decreasingly likely to reflect POc etyma and may be the results of cultural change as Oceanic
speakers moved further out into the Pacific.

    Except for the authors of Chapter 7, contributors have not sought to make fresh
reconstructions at interstages superordinate to POc. What they have done, however, is to cite
other scholars' reconstructions for higher-order interstages, as these represent a summary of
the non-Oceanic evidence in support of a given POc reconstruction. Occasionally, non-Oceanic
evidence has been found to support a POc reconstruction where no reconstruction at a
higher-level interstage has previously been made. In this case a new higher-order
reconstruction is
made, and the non-Oceanic evidence is given in a footnote. Chapter 2 is a brief technical
introduction to those aspects of POc which are relevant to the reconstruction of POc words. It
is mainly intended for readers with linguistic training.

    Whilst we have tried to use the internal organisation of the lexicons of Oceanic languages
themselves as a guide in setting the boundaries of each terminology, we have inevitably taken
decisions which differ from those that others might have made. There are, obviously, overlaps
and connections between various semantic domains and therefore between the contributions
here. We have done our best to provide cross-references, but we have sometimes duplicated
information rather than ask the reader repeatedly to look elsewhere in the book. Indexes at
the end of each volume and in the final volume are intended to make it easier to use the
volumes collectively as a work of reference.

                                                                                       Introduction        13

1.4.2 Data

    The sources of our data are listed in Appendix 1.

    For most reconstructed etyma, only a representative sample of reflexes is given. We have
endeavoured to ensure, however, that in each case this sample not only is geographically and
genetically representative, but also provides evidence to justify the shape of the
reconstruction. Where only a few reflexes are known to us, this is usually noted.

    Because our supporting data are drawn from such a wide range of languages, the convention
is adopted of prefixing each language name with the abbreviation for the group of languages
to which the language belongs, so that the distribution of a cognate set is more immediately
obvious. These groups are genetic except, perhaps, North/Central Vanuatu (abbreviated 'NCV')
and Fijian (abbreviated 'Fij').[11] We have sought to be consistent in always listing these
groups in the same order, but contributors vary in the ordering of languages within groups.

   Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages from
which data are cited here, all data are transcribed into a standard orthography (see
Ross 1988: 3-4) in order to facilitate comparison. Except for inflexional morphemes,
non-cognate portions of reflexes, i.e. derivational morphemes and non-cognate parts of compounds, are
shown in parentheses (…). Where an inflexional morpheme is an affix or clitic and can
readily be omitted, its omission is indicated by a hyphen at the beginning or end of the base.
This applies particularly to possessor suffixes on directly possessed nouns (Ch. 2, §3.2).
Where an inflexional morpheme cannot readily be omitted, then it is separated from its base
by a hyphen. This may happen because of complicated morphophonemics or because the
morpheme is always present, like the adjectival _-n_ in some NNG and Admiralties languages
and prefixed reflexes of the POc article _*na_ in scattered languages. When a reflex is itself
polymorphemic (i.e. the morphemes reflect morphemes present in the reconstructed etymon)
or contains a reduplication, the morphemes or reduplicates are also separated by a hyphen.

[11] An argument that North/Central Vanuatu does not constitute a genetic subgroup is made
     by Lynch (1995) and summarised in Lynch, Ross and Crowley (2002: Ch. 5). The argument
     that Fijian does not constitute a genetic subgroup was made by Geraghty (1983) and is
     incorporated into Figure 1, where 'Fijian' comprises Rotuman, the East Fijian dialects,
     and West Fijian (also a dialect network).


1.4.3 Conventions used in representing reconstructions

   POc reconstructions, and also PWOc, PEOc and PNGOc reconstructions, are given in the
orthography of §3.4. For reconstructions at higher-order interstages the orthographies are
those used by Blust in his various publications and the ACD. Reconstructions at lower-order
interstages are given in the standard orthography adopted for data (§4.2). Geraghty's (1986)
PCP orthography, for example, is based on Standard Fijian spelling, and is converted into our
standard orthography in the same way as Fijian. Biggs' PPn reconstructions are in any case
written in an orthography identical to our standard.

   Bracketing and segmentation conventions in protoforms are:

__ul__
   _(x)_      it cannot be determined whether _x_ was present
   _(x,y)_    either _x_ or _y_ was present
   _[x]_      the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with and one without _x_
   [x,y]      the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with _x_ and one with _y_
   _x-y_      _x_ and _y_ are separate morphemes
   _x-_       _x_ takes an enclitic or a suffix
   _<x>_      _x_ is an infix

                          14              Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond

   It happens fairly often that the final consonant in a higher-order reconstructed etymon
(e.g. _*-R_ in PMP _*kamaliR_ 'men's house') is not evidenced in any Oceanic reflex. Often POc
final consonants are regularly lost in all the languages from which reflexes are drawn, and
we therefore have no evidence as to whether or not the final consonant was retained in the
POc etymon in question. In such a case, since we know that final consonants were usually
retained in POc, the consonant is reconstructed in brackets (e.g. POc _*kamali(R)_).

    When historical linguists compile cognate sets, they commonly retain the glosses given in
the sources from which the items are taken. However, again in the interests of comparison,
we have often reworded (and sometimes abbreviated) the glosses of our sources. Where the
latter were in a language other than English, we have translated them. In the interests of
space and legibility, and because data often have multiple sources, we have given the source
of a reflex only when it is not included in the listing in Appendix 1. We have adopted the
convention of providing no gloss beside the items in a cognate set whose gloss is identical to
that of the POc (or other lower-order) reconstruction at the head of the set, i.e. the
reconstruction which they reflect.

    Where glosses have been standardised, they are given according to the conventions
described by Geraghty (1983:8-11), although our abbreviations differ from his. Briefly, a
noun modifying a gloss is enclosed in brackets. If it refers to a subject or possessor, it
precedes the gloss; if to an object, it follows the gloss. A plus sign after the noun
indicates that it is a member of a set (e.g. the gloss '(basket +) old' indicates that a set
of items of which 'basket' is a member,
probably inanimates, may function as subject of the stative verb glossed as 'old'). Where
necessary, we use '(V) ', '(VI)', or '(VT)' to indicate that a gloss is a verb, intransitive verb or
transitive verb, '(N)' to indicate that it is a noun. In glosses we use the conventional abbreviations
'k.o.' (as in 'k.o. yam') for 'kind of', 's.o.' for 'someone', and 's.t.' for 'something'.

    In putting together cognate sets, we have quite often found apparent reflexes which do not
quite 'fit' the set: either they display a phonological irregularity or their meaning is just a little
too different from the rest of the set for us to assume cognacy. Rather than eliminate them,
our authors often include them below the cognate set under the rubric 'cf. also'.

    We have mostly not indicated the POc word class to which a reconstruction belongs, as
this is often unclear. POc word classes and factors affecting their identification are discussed
in Chapter 2, as are issues concerning the derivational morphology which can be reconstructed
for POc.




2 Proto Oceanic phonology and morphology

2.1       Introduction

   This chapter is intended largely for historical linguists who have an interest in the
reconstruction of POc phonology and grammar. The non-linguist reader who chooses to skip
it will miss little that diminishes understanding of the chapters which follow.


2.2 Phonology

2.2.1 Phonemes

   Work based on the sound correspondences (Ch. 1, §3.3) of both Oceanic and non-Oceanic
languages has resulted in the following reconstructed paradigms of POc consonants and
vowels:

__pre__
*pʷ         *p          *t            *c           *k         *q
*bʷ         *b          *d            *j           *g
                        *s
*mʷ         *m          *n            *ñ           *ŋ
                        *r                                    *R
                        *dr
                        *l
*w                                    *y

__pre__
            *i                        *u
            *e                        *o
                        *a


16      Malcolm Ross

The paradigm reconstructed by Dempwolff (1937) has been modified in various ways by
Haudricourt (1951), Milke (1968), Grace (1969), Wolff (1974), Blust (1978b) and
Ross (1988, 1989b, 1996d). The paradigm and orthography here are from Ross (1988), with the
addition of _*pʷ_.

The reconstruction of _*pʷ_ was first proposed (with little commentary) by Blust (1984), and
used in reconstructions by Ross (1994a, 1996d). The POc consonant inventory reconstructed
by Ross (1988:93-94), as well as its orthographically somewhat different predecessor
reconstructed by Grace (1969; see §2.4), included the pairs _*p_ and _*b_, _*t_ and _*d_, and _*k_ and
_*g_,[1] but only the single velarised bilabial _*bʷ_ (Grace's _*ŋp_); so the conclusion that _*pʷ_ is also
required by the data is not surprising. However, the reflexes of _*pʷ_ have not been worked out
as fully as those of other POc consonants (they are generally missing from the sources listed
in Chapter 1, §3.3), and unexplained inconsistencies remain among the small number of
widely reflected items in which it is reconstructed. Reflexes which signal its presence are:

a) velarised bilabials (usually _pʷ_) in contexts where they do not reflect _*bʷ_;
   see _*pʷaraq_, _*pʷararaq_ 'thunder', _*pʷatik_ 'potato yam, aerial yam, Dioscorea bulbifera', _*ku(p,pʷ)ena_ 'fishing net';
b) apparent fortis reflexes of _*p_ in Western Oceanic and SES languages in environments where a lenis reflex is usually found;
   see _*(p,pʷ)ilak_ 'lightning', _*pʷaraq_, _*pʷararaq_ 'thunder', _*pʷatik_ 'potato yam, aerial yam, Dioscorea bulbifera', _*pʷita_ 'snare; to snare', _*(p,pʷ)aRaRa_ 'handle' ;
c) apparent reflexes of _*b_ or _*bʷ_ in Polynesian or Nuclear Micronesian (and occasionally other) languages;
   see _*la(p,pʷ)a(r,R)_ 'lightning, phosphorescence', _*pʷaraq_, _*pʷararaq_ 'thunder', _*ku(p,pʷ)ena_ 'fishing net', _*(p,pʷ)aRaRa_ 'handle'.

In some cases we reconstruct _*(p,pʷ)_ as we are unsure whether the protophoneme was _*pʷ_ or
whether we are confronted by one of several other phenomena, including (i) borrowing, (ii)
Western Oceanic and SES fortis reflexes of _*p_, or (iii) velarisation before a rounded vowel in
certain languages. As Blust (1981a) remarks with regard to POc _*bʷ_ and _*mʷ_, velarisation
generally does not occur in non-Oceanic languages and sometimes occurs in POc etyma
where non-Oceanic cognates give us no reason to expect it.

   Although the reconstructed paradigm is fairly secure, questions remain about the phonetics
of some segments. The phonemes _*pʷ_, _*bʷ_ and _*mʷ_ are known in the literature as 'labio-velars';
this orthography reflects their pronunciation in the majority of Oceanic languages in which
they remain distinct, but there is evidence to suggest that they may have had the double
articulations [k͡p], [g͡b] and [ŋ͡m] that 'labio-velar' suggests, since some languages (e.g.
Mwotlap) have these realisations, whilst others (on Malaita and in Fiji) have velar reflexes.
Among the apicals, it is possible that _*t_ was dental, the others alveolar, as in a number of
west Indonesian languages (Ozanne-Rivierre 1992) and in Banoni (MM, NW Solomonic).
The voiced obstruents in the second row were also prenasalised. Probably the phoneme _*r_ was
an alveolar trill, whilst _*dr_ was a prenasalised alveolar trill, reflected thus in languages in the
Admiralties and Fiji. The phoneme _*c_ is assumed to have been a voiceless palatal obstruent,
because this is the articulation one would predict on the basis of non-Oceanic cognates and of
its position in the paradigm. However, it is distinctively reflected only in some Admiralties
languages, where its reflexes are mostly alveolar liquids ([l], [r)) or glottals ([ʔ], [h)). Elsewhere
it has merged with _*s_. The phoneme _*j_ is more widely reflected, as [tʃ], [dʒ] or [d], and was
more evidently a voiced palatal obstruent. Of the two postvelars (see Ross 1988:31 -32), _*q_
was probably a glottal stop, but its uvular stop reflexes in some languages give room for
doubt, whilst _*R_ was probably a uvular trill, easily lost or merged with _*r_ or _*l_ in daughter
languages.

[1] These pairs are derived from PMP pairs of which the first member was an obstruent, the
    second a nasal + obstruent sequence, and so, viewed diachronically, the POc pairs
    _*r_ and _*dr_, _*s_ and _*j_, and _*c_ and _*j_ (sic)
     belong here too.

                                                                      Phonology and grammar                17

    A noteworthy feature of the reconstructed consonant paradigm is that the only phonemic
contrast between stops and fricatives is the one between _*t_/_*d_ and _*s_, but, on the basis of
widespread reflexes, it is likely that *[ɸ, β] and *[x, ɣ] occurred as allophones of _*p_ and _*k_
(and *[z] of _*s_). It is also possible that a voiced flap was an intervocalic allophone of _*t_.



2.2.2 Phonotactics

    POc words were made up of (C)V syllables, with the option of a word-final consonant.
These word-final consonants are lost in the majority of Oceanic languages, but retained in a
scattering of Western Oceanic languages, in Mussau, and in some cases in South Vanuatu
and New Caledonian languages. Quite often, we know that the PMP form had a final
consonant, but no reflex occurs in any of the Oceanic languages which reflect final consonants,
and so we have no means of knowing whether that consonant occurred in POc or not. In such
cases the final consonant is shown in parentheses in the reconstructed POc form: e.g. PMP
_*kamaliR_ 'men's house' but POc _*kamali(R)_ (Ch. 3, §3.3). Similarly, where a suffixed form
preserves a root-final consonant but the unsuffixed root loses it, the unsuffixed form is
reconstructed with a parenthesised final consonant, e.g. POc _*kinit-i-_ (VT) 'pinch (s.t./s.o.)'
but _*kini(t)_ (VI) 'pinch'. It appears that PMP word-final consonants were quite consistently
retained in POc, but to my knowledge no one has demonstrated that this is so.

    PMP permitted CVC syllables both word-finally and word-internally, as in _*gapgap_
'stammer'. One of the innovations which defines POc is the loss of the final consonant of a
word-medial syllable, as in POc _*kaka(p)_. The most common context for this innovation is
reduplicated forms like _*gapgap_ (Blust 1977a), but it also occurred elsewhere; for example,
PMP _*beRŋi_ 'night' became POc _*boŋi_.

    The prenasalised consonants _*bʷ_, _*b_, _*d_, _*j_, _*g_, _*dr_ and the glides _*w_, _*y_ did not occur
word-finally. The consonant _*d_ seems to have occurred only intervocalically: if it did occur
word-initially, these occurrences were extremely rare.

    POc vowel sequences have, to my knowledge, never been systematically investigated, but
they seem not to have been particularly common. A check of several geographically and
genetically well distributed languages which are otherwise phonologically conservative[2] reveals
a consistency which probably reflects the POc pattern, namely that each vowel in a sequence
is the nucleus of a separate syllable. Although some Oceanic languages contrast long vowels
with short or contrast a sequence of two identical vowels with a single vowel, this kind of
contrast is not reconstructed for POc, where only sequences of unlike vowels were permitted.
POc _*e_ is derived from PMP word-final _*-ay_ (§2.4), and this historical origin apparently
precludes its occurrence in POc vowel sequences except in a few probable borrowings and
some derived forms. However, it is probable that all sequences of _*i_, _*a_, _*o_ and _*u_ occurred.
Well attested, for example, are _*waiR_ 'fresh water', _*raun_ 'leaf', _*maosak_ 'ready to be eaten
(because ripe or cooked)', _*bou_ 'main bearers supporting raised floor or roof structure, centre
post supporting ridgepole', _*panua_ 'inhabited territory; community together with its land and
things on it', _*qio(r,R)_ 'spear, arrow'. It is probable, incidentally, that the falling sequences
_*ua_ and _*ia_ were not distinct from _*uwa_ and _*iya_.


[2]   The languages and sources are: Loniu (Admiralties, Hamel 1994:7-8), Manam
(WOc, NNG, Lichtenberk 1983: 21 -32), Tawala (WOc, PT, Ezard 1997), Nakanai (WOc, MM,
Johnston 1980: 247-248), Kwaio (EOc, SES, Keesing 1985: 8-9), Longgu (EOc, SES, Hill 1992),
Nguna (EOc, NCV, Schütz 1969: 11 - 12), Boumaa Fijian (EOc, Fij, Dixon 1988: 15- 16).

2.2.3 Stress

   POc stress also remains uninvestigated, but phonologically conservative languages generally
agree in displaying primary stress on the penultimate syllable and secondary stress on every
second syllable preceding the penultimate, and this was probably the basic POc pattern.

2.2.4 Phonological innovations and Proto Oceanic orthographies

     Oceanic languages reflect a set of shared innovations relative to PMP, and it was on the
basis of some of these that Dempwolff (1937) first recognised Oceanic as a major Austronesian
subgroup. A number of these innovations occurred among the consonants, as we see when we
tabulate the correspondences between the reconstructed consonant paradigms of PMP and
POc (for discussion of the PMP consonant paradigm, see Ross 1992 or 1995b). Table 1 kills
two birds with one stone, also showing the two current POc orthographies. The first was
established by Grace (1969) and has been used with a number of variants (separated by a
slash) shown below. The second is the one generally used in this chapter, introduced by Ross
(1988).

The terms 'oral grade' and 'nasal grade' were used by Grace (1969) and have become
conventional among Oceanic linguists to refer to the outcomes of (c) below. Grace's orthography
roughly represents the pre-POc situation. The innovations which occurred over the pre-POc
period were mergers and splits, the introduction of new phonemes, and one deletion, as
follows:

a)   The PMP voiced/voiceless pairs _*p_, _*b_ and _*k_, _*g_ merged respectively as early pre-POc
     _*p_ and _*k_. Ozanne-Rivierre (1992) suggests that the corresponding _*t_, _*d_ merger was
     hindered by their mismatch in point of articulation (dental vs alveolar).

b)   The PMP pairs _*s_, _*Z_ and _*d_, _*r_ merged respectively as pre-POc _*s_ and _*d_ (phonetically
     probably [r], since Eastern Malayo-Polynesian cognates are liquids).

c)   PMP and a number of its descendants had word-medial homorganic nasal + obstruent
     sequences (not in Table 1). Some instances of the pre-POc word-initial obstruents _*p_, _*t_,
     _*k_, _*d/r_, _*s_ and _*j_ also acquired a preceding homorganic nasal (the occurrence of this
     process is unpredictable and its causes largely unknown; cf. §3.1.3). These sequences
     became the unitary early pre-POc phonemes _*mp_, _*nt_, _*ŋk_, _*nd/nr_ and _*nj_, subsequently
     the POc prenasalised voiced obstruents _*b_, _*d_, _*g_, _*dr_, and _*j_ (PMP nasal + _*s_ and nasal
     + _*j_ merged as pre-POc _*nj_, POc _*j_). It is possible that pre-POc _*nt_, POc _*d_ never
     occurred word-initially.

d)   The labio-velars _*pʷ_, _*bʷ_ and _*mʷ_ entered the language. Most of the items containing a
     labio-velar lack non-Oceanic cognates, and some, at least, must have been borrowed
     into POc from neighbouring Papuan languages. For example, it can be argued that
     _*mʷapo(q)_ 'taro' was borrowed by POc speakers as they acquired more sophisticated
     taro-growing techniques from Papuan speakers (Ross 1996d). A few of these items
     were inherited into POc, and the labio-velar was the reflex of a labial occurring next to
     a round vowel. However, it is not clear in these items that the labio-velar actually
     occurred in POc (Blust 1981a). Thus a number of Oceanic languages reflect _*tamʷata_
     'man, husband', derived from _*tau_ 'body, person' + _*mataq_ 'unripe, immature, young',
     but we cannot be sure whether this or _*taumata(q)_ was the POc form.

e)   PMP _*h_ was lost in POc.

f)   PMP _*e_, phonetically [ə], became POc _*o_, and the PMP word-final diphthongs _*-uy(-)_,[3]
        _*-aw_ and _*-ay_ were simplified to POc _*-i_, _*-o_ and _*-e_ respectively, the first two thereby
        merging with plain vowels.

[3] The notation _*-uy(-)_ reflects the fact that there is one known case where the change to _*i_ occured word-medially: PMP _*kamuihu_ (independent 2PL pronoun) > _*kamuyu_ > POc _*kamiu_.

The combined effect of (a) and (c) is that each of the PMP pairs _*p_, _*b_ and _*k_, _*g_ first
merged and then split. As a result, for example, PMP _*p_ became either POc _*p_ or POc _*b_,
and the same was true of PMP _*b_, giving the kind of crossover seen in the initial consonants
of these examples:

__pre__
PMP *panas           'hot, warm'              POc *panas
PMP *punay           'wild pigeon'            POc *bune

20   Malcolm Ross

Similarly, either PMP *k or PMP *g could become either POc *k or POc *g. For example,

__pre__
PMP *kuDen           'cooking pot'            POc *kuron
PMP *kabut           'mist'                   POc *gabu
PMP *gapgap          'stammer'                POc *kaka(p)
PMP *gemgem          'make a fist'            POc *gugu(m) 'grasp in fist, clench fist'.[4]

[4]  PMP etyma with an unambiguous initial _*g-_ are rare, and this example shows a mismatch between the
  vowels of PMP and POc (see Ch. 9, §7).


2.3 Word classes

   The remarks below on POc word classes and derivational morphology are rather brief,
largely because these remain somewhat poorly explored areas. More detail is provided by
Lynch, Ross and Crowley (2002), but there is a great deal about POc morphosyntax
that we do not know and which is perhaps irretrievable. The major publication on POc
grammar is Pawley (1973).[5]

   Ideally, the reconstruction of a Proto Oceanic etymon should include not only its form and
meaning, but also its word class membership. POc had just two open lexeme classes: nouns
and verbs. POc was a head-marking language, and each valent (dependent) noun phrase was
cross-referenced on its head noun or verb by a clitic or suffix. Both nouns and verbs fell into
two subclasses on the basis of valency.

[5]  Pawley's (1972) reconstruction of PEOc grammar is also relevant to POc reconstruction, particularly as it is
  not clear that EOc was a discrete interstage, and features reconstructed for PEOc may consequently be
  attributable to POc.


2.3.1 Verbs[6]

   POc verbs had a valency of either one or two, that is, they were either intransitive or
transitive. There were probably no trivalent/ditransitive verbs, i.e., verbs whose role structures
required or allowed three noun phrases without case marking, but we cannot be certain about
this, as some modern languages do have trivalent verbs (Manam, Hoava).

   Verbs apparently took a proclitic cross-referencing their subject and, if transitive, an
enclitic cross-referencing their object (in many daughter languages these are a prefix and a
suffix), e.g. POc _*i-kiniti-au_ 'he pinched me' (cf. Manam _i-ʔint-a_).[7] To judge from descriptions
of verbs in modern Oceanic languages (e.g. Dixon 1988: 201-202), a majority of POc verb
roots had both intransitive and transitive (or causative) alternants. In at least one language,
Hoava (WOc, MM), all verbs in the corpus have transitive and intransitive alternants (Davis
1997).

[6]  In order to reconstruct the POc verbal system, I have consulted grammars which (a) are sufficiently detalled
  and (b) describe languages which seem phonologically and morphologically quite conservative. There are not
  many of these: I have consulted descriptions of Manam (WOc, NNG) (Lichtenberk 1983), Hoava (WOc,
  MM) (Davis 1997), Kwaio (Keesing 1985) and Longgu (Hill (992) (both EOc, SES), Ambae (Catriona
  Hyslop, pers.comm.) and Malo (Jauncey 1997) (both EOc, NCV) and Boumaa Fijian (EOc, Fij) (Dixon
  1988). The criterion of morphological conservatism is the sharing of morphosyntactic features across djfferent
  Oceanic subgroups. Unfortunately, we have no grammar of an Admiralties language which is sufficiently
  detalled.

[7]  It is not clear how complete the POc clitic sets were. Evidence is strong that an object enclitic occurred only
    if the object was singular or third person non-singular. If it was first or second person non-singular, the
    object was probably an independent pronoun (Evans 1995). Something similar may have been true of subject
    proclitics.

                                                                            Phonology and grammar                   21



2.3. 1. 1 Verb classes

   We can reconstruct three major classes of POc intransitive verb on the basis of semantic
and morphological criteria, as shown in Table 2.

__Table 2: Classes of intransitive verb in Proto Oceanic__

__table__
|                 |  1      |  2  |   3 | 4   |
|             --- |  ---    | --- | --- | --- |
|                 | inherently stative or inherently dynamic? | intransitive  subject | forms a transitive? | forms a causative? |
| A verbs         | dynamic | A   | yes | yes |
| U verbs         | neither | U   | yes | yes |
| U-stative verbs | stative | U   | no  | yes |

    As Table 2 shows, the only criterion which distinguishes all three classes from each other
is a semantic one: is the intransitive verb inherently dynamic[8], inherently stative, or inherently
neither (column 1)? However, I follow Oceanist convention by using labels which refer to the
macrorole of the intransitive subject: A for actor, U for undergoer (column 2), even though
this leads to the partially redundant 'U-stative' label where 'stative' would do.[9]

[8]   I use the term 'dynamic' (rather than 'active') in contrast with 'stative' simply because 'active' also contrasts
    in a quite different sense with 'passive'.

[9]   The terms 'actor' and 'undergoer' are from Foley and van Valin (1984). Dixon (1988) uses A
and O. Arms (1974a), Foley (1976) and others use A (actor/agent) and P (patient), but this
labelling is infelicitous in
    today's terms as it confuses macrorole (A, U) and role (agent, patient, experiencer, theme etc.). The distinctions
    between the three classes were first demonstrated systematically by Pawley (1973: 126- 140) with data from
    Motu (PT), Roviana (MM), Kwara'ae (SES), Arosi (SES), and Bauan Fijian. The seminal work on Fijian A
    and U verbs is Arms (1974a). Biggs (1974) addresses parallel issues in Polynesian, Foley (1976) in Malayo-Polynesian. Boumaa Fijian examples in this section are from Dixon (1988:204, 231).

    Fijian preserves the classification in Table 2 quite clearly, although individual verb forms
in modern Fijian are not always in the same classes as the POc etyma they reflect. Intransitive
verbs with an actor subject, i.e. A verbs, are necessarily dynamic (Table 2, columns 1 and 2).
The subject of the intransitive is also the subject of the corresponding transitive, as the
Boumaa Fijian clauses in (1) illustrate:

22      Malcolm Ross

__pre__
(1) a. Au   rabe.
       s:1s kick
       'I'm kicking.'
    b. Au    rabe-t-a     a   polo.
       s:1s  kick-TR-O:3s ART ball
       'I'm kicking the ball.'

   Intransitive verbs with an undergoer subject, on the other hand, fall into two classes, U
and U-stative. With U verbs the subject of the intransitive is the object of the corresponding
transitive:

__pre__
(2) a. E    gagi  a   dovu.
       s:3s crush ART sugarcane
       'The sugarcane is being crushed.'
    b. Au   gagi-a     a   dovu.
       s:1s crush-O:3s ART sugarcane
       'I'm crushing the sugarcane.'

U verbs and U-statives differ from each other in two respects. First, unlike U verbs, U-statives
have no corresponding transitive (but do have a corresponding causative, as described below).
Second, U-statives like loaloa 'be black' in (3) are inherently stative, whereas U verbs like
gagi in (4) are inherently neither dynamic nor stative. With appropriate aspect marking and
context, the clause in (4) may be given either a dynamic ('the sugarcane is being crushed') or
a stative ('the sugarcane is [already] crushed') interpretation.

__pre__
(3) E    loaloa   a   ʔolii yai.
    s:3s be.black ART dog   this
    'This dog is black.'
(4) E    gagi  a   dovu.
    s:3s crush ART sugarcane
    'The sugarcane is crushed.'

The dividing line between U and U-stative is a thin one. In some, probably many, Oceanic
languages, including Fijian, appropriate aspect marking can force a dynamic interpretation of
an U-stative (e.g. of 'black' as 'become black '). There does, however, seem to be a semantic
difference between the two classes: intransitive U verbs imply some unmentioned agent or
instrument, whereas U-statives do not.

   There is a tendency both in the reconstruction of POc (Pawley 1973)[10] and in descriptions
of modern Oceanic languages to regard all intransitives with an U subject as stative. In some
modern languages this is seems to be correct, but in others, and apparently in POc, they
are/were distributed between the classes I have labelled U and U-stative. [11]

   Although it is not difficult to identify the three verb classes in many modern Oceanic
languages, it can often be difficult to determine which class a given POc verb belonged to.
The reasons for this are: (i) languages which retain the three classes do not always agree on
the class to which the reflexes of a given POc verb belong; (ii) in some languages (e.g.
Kwaio) more than others (e.g. Longgu), a verb may belong to more than one class, and indeed
some verbs may have belonged to two classes in POc; (iii) particularly in north-west Melanesia
there are languages which have entirely lost the stative class (e.g. Takia) and/or the neutral
class (e.g. Takia, Tawala, Mangap-Mbula), replacing all statives and some neutral verbs by
adjectives or adjectival nouns (Ross 1998a) and transferring other neutral verbs to the dynamic
class.

[10]   Pawley (1973:128) has A-class statives and B-class statives, corresponding respectively to my U-stative and
     U classes. His Intradirectives are members of my A class, which also includes the intransitive alternants of
     his Spontaneous Transitives and Deliberate Transitives. The differences among the subclasses of A intransitives
     are not morphological but lie in the exact semantic roles of their subjects and of the objects of their transitive
     alternants.

[11]     Thus, this example from Hoava is labelled "stative" by Davis (1997) but the verb appears to be an U verb, at
     least in this usage (sa leboto is the subject of intransitive tuke):
      Tuke                sa       leboto.
      be.thrown.away ART:SG bushknife
      'The bushknife was thrown away.'

2.3. 1.2 Derivational morphology of verbs

   POc transitivising morphology was rather different from that of its Fijian reflexes above.
POc verb roots were mostly disyllabic and, in line with POc phonotactics (§2.2), either
consonant-final or vowel-final, that is, (C)V(C)VC or (C)V(C)V. In most cases, the canonic
shape of the root alone determined its transitivising morphology. The transitive of a
consonant-final root was formed by adding the suffix _*-i-_ between the root and the object enclitic. This
suffix is known in the Oceanic literature as the '(close) transitive suffix' and was the same
regardless of whether the root was A or U :

__table__
| (5) |         | intransitive                | corresponding transitive        |               |
| --- | ---     | ---                         | ---                             | ---           |
|     | A verbs | _*kinit_[12] 'pinch'        | _*kinit-i-_ 'pinch (s.o/s.t)'   | (Ch. 9, §6.3) |
|     |         | _*inum_ 'drink '            | _*inum-i-_  'drink (s.t.)'      |               |
|     | U verbs | _*pʷosa(k)_ 'crack open'    | _*pʷosak-i-_ 'crack (s.t.) open'| (Ch. 9, §5.2) |
|     |         | _*loŋoR_ 'be audible'       | _*loŋoR-i-_ 'hear, listen to'   |               |

[12] Note that _*kinit_ is reconstructed with final _*-t_ but _*pwosa(k)_ with parenthesised _*-k_ simply because we have a
     reflex of _*kinit_ in a language which retains POc final consonants, but none for _*pwosa(k)_. Following the
     convention outlined in §2.2, final _*(-k)_ is inferred from reflexes of transitive _*pʷosak-i-_.

    With a vowel-final root like _*wase-_ 'share (s.t.) out' or _*kati-_ 'husk (s.t.) with teeth', no
transitive suffix occurred and the object enclitic was added directly to the root (Evans 1997).
The one possible exception to this are roots ending in _*-a_, where the suffix _*-i-_ probably
occurred between the root and the object enclitic, at least when the enclitic itself began with
_*a_ (_*au_ o:1s, _*a_ o:3S). Note that the final _*-i-_ of a disyllabic base like _*kati_ was also present
when the verb was used intransitively. Hence it was not a transitive suffix in POc, although
in some cases it was derived from an earlier suffix. With vowel-final roots, as with
consonant-final, there was no formal difference between A and U roots:

__pre__

|     | A verbs | _*kati_ 'husk with teeth' | _*kati-_ 'husk (s.t.) with teeth'     | (Ch. 9, §3.7) |
|     |         | _*muri_ 'follow'          | _*muri-_ 'follow (s.t./s.o.)'         |               |
|     |         | _*soka_ 'pierce, stab'    | _*soka-i-_ 'pierce, stab (s.t./s.o.)' | (Ch. 9, §4.1) |
|     | U verbs | _*wase_ 'be shared out'   | _*wase-_ 'share (s.t.) out'           |               |
|     |         | _*poli_ 'be bought'       | _*poli-_ 'buy (s.t.)'                 |               |

   Below are some examples of POc intransitive/transitive verb pairs with their Boumaa
Fijian reflexes. The POc transitive includes the third person object enclitic _*a_:

The reader will notice that formal restructuring has occurred in Fijian. The POc final consonant
is lost from consonant-final intransitives. This leads to a resegrnentation of the transitive,
such that the intransitive form is treated as the root in Fijian, the POc final consonant
becomes the transitive marker, and the POc transitive suffix _*-i-_ is lost. Because the POc
consonant is no longer part of the Fijian root but an allomorph of the transitive suffix, the
etymological consonant is sometimes replaced by another or a consonant has been inserted
where none is expected (Arms 1974b).[13] This is the case with _roŋo-o-a_ 'hear it' above, where
the normal Fijian reflex of POc _*R_ is zero or occasionally _r_, but never _o_.

    Fijian-like restructuring has occurred in many Oceanic languages because of the loss of
the POc final consonant. In most of these languages (and in some Fijian dialects), _*-i-_ has not
been lost, with the result that a language has a set of transitive suffixes with the form _-Ci-_, as
in Longgu.

__table__
| (8)| POc            |               | Longgu      |
| ---|---             | ---           | ---         |
|    | _*inum_        | 'drink'       |  _inu_      |
|    | _*inum-i-a_    | 'drink it'    |  _inu-vi-a_ |
|    | _*taŋis_       | 'weep'        |  _aŋi_      |
|    | _*taŋis-i-a_   | 'weep for it' |  _aŋi-si-a_ |

The consonant of the _-Ci-_ suffix is known as the 'thematic consonant'. Transitive verbs in our
data corpus are often cited with a reflex of POc _*a_ o:3s. Where this can readily be omitted
because it permutes with other object enclitics, its absence is marked with a hyphen. Where it
is not synchronically separable, it is parenthesised in accord with the conventions of Chapter
1, §4.2.

    Above, I wrote that transitivising morphology is determined in most cases by the canonic
shape of the root. There are some exceptions to this generalisation, and one set of these is
discussed by Blust (1977a). These consist of forms like those in (9), descended from a PAn or
PMP reduplicated monosyllabic root. The intransitive POc form in each case reflects the
earlier form with regular loss of the final consonant of the first syllable (§2.2). The transitive
form reflects a single monosyllabic root plus an _*-i-_ which by POc times was no longer
separable, so that the transitive forms were similar in their behaviour to the transitive forms
of vowel-final roots like *kati- 'husk with teeth'.

[13] A special case of non-etymological consonant insertion occurs with (A) verbs of motion and
posture, where the transitive form takes a location as its object. For example, Longgu _eno_
'lie down' (< POc _*qeno_) vs
_eno-vi-_ 'lie on', _dio_ 'fall' (< POc _*sipo_ 'descend') vs _dio-ŋi-_ 'fall on'; Boumaa _laʔo_
'go' (< POc _*lako_) vs
_laʔo-vi-_ 'go for'. To date I have found such cases only in EOc languages and do not reconstruct
this feature for POc.

We also find 'deponent' cases in POc where a PAn/PMP reduplicated monosyllable and a
POc transitive monosyllable + _*-i-_ form are reconstructable, but no intransitive form. This is
perhaps a reflection of the fact that in many cases the formal relationship between reflexes
of the intransitive and transitive forms, especially after loss of the final consonant from the
intransitive, has become so opaque that the pairing of all but the most frequently used forms
has been lost.

    We have seen that a majority of non-stative POc verb roots had both intransitive and
transitive (or causative) alternants, and that the transitive is usually derived from the intransitive.
There seem to have been a few POc verb roots, however, which were intrinsically transitive
and from which either an A or an U intransitive could be formed.

    An A intransitive was formed by reduplicating the disyllabic (transitive) root. One such
verb was apparently POc _*kani-_ 'eat (s.t.)', whose corresponding intransitive was _*kani-kani_.
Hence we find Malo (NCV) _hani-_ 'eat (s.t.)' vs _han-hani_ 'eat' and Motu (PT) _ani-_ vs _ani-ani_.
A Boumaa Fijian example is _ʔusi-_ 'wipe (s.t.) with a cloth' vs _ʔusi-ʔusi_ 'wipe hands after
washing them at the end of a meal'.[15]

    An U or U-stative intransitive was apparently formed by prefixing the anti-causative
prefix _*ma-_ to the transitive root, reflected, e.g., in Malo _ma-duru_ 'be split' from _duru_ 'split
(s.t.)' and _ma-mbila_ 'be shattered' from _bila_ 'shatter (s.t.)', and in Arosi _ma-hita_ 'be split,
broken' from _hita_ 'split, hit, strike (s.t.)'. Like these examples, most modern reflexes of _*ma-_
derive U-statives from transitives, but we have already noted a tendency for U intransitives to
become statives. There is, however, a scattering of languages in the North New Guinea and
Papuan Tip clusters where _ma-_ derives A verbs. Since these are languages in which U
intransitives have been reinterpreted as A intransitives, I take it that these A verbs reflect
earlier U verbs. For example, from Sio _liŋi_, Misima _liŋi-n_ 'pour (s.t.) out' we can reconstruct
transitive POc _*liŋi_ 'pour (s.t.) out', and from Sio _ma-liŋi_, Misima _ma-liŋi-n_ '(liquid) run
away' we can reconstruct the POc U verb _*ma-liŋi_ 'be poured out'.

    Thus there were five morphological relationships between intransitive and transitive forms
in POc, illustrated in (10), the first two being the most widely represented:

[14]   These reconstructions are drawn from Ch. 9. Glosses are abbreviated or omitted here for the sake of clarity,
     and cross-references are to the full presentations in Ch. 9.

[15]   Possible counterevidence is provided by Longgu, where reduplication forms both A and U
       intransitives: _ale-a_
     'bite him' vs _ale-ale_ 'bite', but _ʔave-a_ 'bend it' vs _ʔave-ʔave_ 'be bent'. But comparative
     evidence suggests that
     _ʔave_ was originally an U verb ('be bent') from which _ʔave-a_ was derived, and that _ʔave-ʔave_
     is the result of pattern extension.

    As the foregoing examples show, in the reconstructions a transitive verb is marked with a
final hyphen. If an intransitive/transitive pair is reconstructed, it will be shown as, e.g., _*kinit_,
_*kinit-i-_ 'pinch'. Where a vowel-final verb like _*wase_ 'distribute' is reconstructed, consistency
would require us to show this as _*wase[-]_, that is, as reconstructable with and without a
following object enclitic. This convention is followed in Chapter 9, but not in other chapters;
it is in any case often very difficult to determine whether a vowel-final root was used both
transitively and intransitively in POC.[16] Where a pair of verbs is reconstructed without and
with _*-i-_, the supporting cognate sets are usually combined. Occasionally, where the cognate
sets supporting the intransitive and transitive forms are of considerable size, they are given as
separate lists.

    One final point must be made with regard to POc _*-i-_. I have adopted the usual convention
of calling it a transitive suffix. However, in a number of modern languages (e.g. Hoava,
Davis 1997), in circumstances where the verb is immediately followed by a modifier, the
'suffix' (if any) and the object enclitic follow the whole verb-modifier complex, suggesting
that _*-i-_ may have been a transitive enclitic rather than a suffix. However, this has no bearing
on lexical reconstruction.

    Implicit in the discussion above are two slightly unusual features of transitivity in POc and
many daughter languages. One is the division of non-stative intransitives into A and U verbs.
The other is the use of the A intransitive alternant of verbs which are semantically transitive.
If the object of, say, POc _*inum_ 'drink' or _*kati_ 'husk with teeth' was not mentioned, the
intransitive form was evidently used.

    Two other morphemes were productive in the derivation of POc verbs: the causativiser
_*pa-_ or _*paka-_ and the applicative _*-aki_ or _*-akini_. As these occur less often in our
reconstructions than the transitivising and detransitivising morphemes discussed above, they
are described only briefly here.

    Although transitives could not be formed from U-stative roots, causatives could be formed
from roots of all three classes. The POc prefix deriving causatives was _*pa-_ or _*paka-_ (both
forms are reconstructable, and the difference between them needs more research). A causative
formed with this prefix was a transitive verb whose subject was alway the causer and whose
object was the same as the subject of the corresponding intransitive verb (Table 2, column 2).
Thus an U-stative verb like POc _*ponuq_ 'be full' could be causativised (= transitivised) with
_*pa[ka]-_ to give _*pa[ka]-ponuq-i-_ 'cause (s.t.) to be full, make (s.t.) full' (object=U). [17] An U
verb like _*wase_ 'be shared out' gave _*pa[ka]-wase-_ 'cause (s.t.) to be shared out' (object=U),
and an A verb like _*inum_ 'drink' gave _*pa[ka]-inum-i-_ 'cause (s.o.) to drink' (object=A).
Presumably the liquid which was drunk was expressed by an oblique phrase, but this needs
more research. The presence or absence of _*-i-_ in causative verbs was again determined by
whether the root ended in a consonant or a vowel.

[16] It could be said that consistency requires us to put a hyphen before every verb to mark the
presence of the subject proclitic, but we find this redundant since in this regard every verb behaves
in the same way.

[17] The fact that U-stative roots could only be transitivised with _*pa[ka]-_ was one of the features
of this verb class recognised by Pawley (Pawley 1973: 128- 129) and used to distinguish it from what I
have here called the U class.

                                                                           Phonology and grammar                  27


   The applicative _*-aki_ or _*-akini_, reconstructed by Pawley (1973) as the 'remote transitive'
suffix, is attached to an A or U root to form a transitive verb. In its canonic usage, the object
of this verb is a referent which would appear as an oblique with the corresponding direct
transitive. For example:

__pre__

           *taŋis-i-a        'weep for it'                taŋi-o-a
           *taŋis-akini-a    'weep about it'              taŋi-oaʔin-a
           *soka             'stab, spear'                ooʔa
           *soka-i-a         'stab, spear it'             ooʔa-
           *soka-(C)-akini-a 'stab, spear with it'        ooʔa-taʔin-a
           *puni             'hide'                       vuni
           *puni-a           'hide it'                    vunt-a
           *puni-(C)-akini-a 'hide (s.t.) for s.o. '      vuni-taʔin-a

Again there are two reconstructable forms, POc _*-aki_ and _*-akini_. The difference between
them needs more research, as does their status, their POc function, and the history of their
reflexes (Harrison 1978, 1982). It was noted above that the POc transitiviser _*-i-_ occurred
only with consonant-final or _*-a-_ final roots. The applicative _*-aki[ni]_ was not subject to this
limitation. In Boumaa Fijian, like other languages, an apparently non-etymological thematic
consonant is in many cases inserted between a vowel-final root (including one in _-a-_) and the
reflex of _*-aki[ni]_ to form _ðoʔa-taʔin-a_, _vuni-taʔin-a_ and so on. The inserted thematic
consonant is apparently a lexically determined choice between _-t-_ and _-v-_.[18] This gives rise to
the reconstructive difficulty seen in (11): we do not have enough information to know what
happened in POc when _*-aki[ni]_ followed a root ending in a vowel.

[18] Cf. _dusi-a_ 'point it out (nearby)' vs _dusi-vaʔin-a_ 'point it out (far off)'; _te-a_ 'plant (crop)' vs _tee-vaʔin-a_
     'plant (land)'; _tala-a_ 'send her/him' vs _tala-vaʔin-a_ 'send for s.o.'.


2.3. 1.3 Fossilised verbal morphology

   The morphology described in §3.1.2 was largely productive when POc diversified into
daughter languages. There are a few patterns in our reconstructions of verbs, however, which
reflect morphology that was already dead by this stage.

   One of these is illustrated in (9), where intransitive forms descended from PAn or PMP
reduplicated monosyllabic roots correspond with transitive forms reflecting the unreduplicated
root plus inseparable _*-i-_. PAn monosyllabic roots have been investigated in some detail by
Blust (1988) and are also often reflected as the second syllable of POc CVCVC intransitive
roots.[19] As a result, consonant-final disyllables with related meanings often share their second
syllable. Thus in Chapter 9, §6.1we find the following reconstructions forming the following
set:

[19]   A tentative explanation of the origin of PAn monosyllabic roots is offered by
Ross (1995b:95-96).

28      Malcolm Ross

__pre__
(12) PAn root *-buC 'weed, pull, pluck out' (Blust 1988: 86-87)
     POc      *pupu(t), *puti-                        'pick (fruit +), pluck (feathers +)'
     POc      *(s,j)apu(t), *(s,j)aput-i-           'pull out, pull up, pluck (fruit, nuts)'
     POc      *tapu(t), *taput-i                      'strip (crops), pull off'

The pair _*pupu(t)_, _*puti-_ reflects PAn _*buC-buC_ in accordance with the paradigm in (9),
whilst the intransitive roots _*(s,j)apu(t)_ and _*taput_ apparently reflect PAn forms _**sa-buC_
and _**ta-buC_.[20] 0ther such sets are:

__pre__
(13) PAn root *-pak 'break, crack, split' (Blust 1988: 135-136)
     POc *sapaki 'pluck off, break off (leaves) with the hand' (Ch. 9, §6.1)
     POc *paki 'pluck, break off (leaves) with the hand' (Ch. 9, §6.1)
     POc *lopa(k) 'break' (Ch. 9, §6.2)

__pre__
(14) PAn root *-Tuk 'knock, pound, beat ' (Blust 1988: 160- 161) (Ch. 9, §5.1)
     POc *tutuk, *tuki- 'pound, mash by pounding, hammer, crack by hammering'
     POc *putu(k) 'repeatedly knock, pound, beat'
     POc *butu(k), *butuk-i- 'repeatedly knock, pound, beat'

__pre__
(15) PAn root *-Tak 'sound of cracking, splitting, knocking' (Blust 1988: 157- 158)
      POc *potak, *potak-i- 'crack open, split open, make incision' (Ch. 9, §3.8)
      POc *botak, *botak-i- 'crack open, split open, make incision' (Ch. 9, §3.8)
      POc *pita(k), *pitak-i- 'break, split' (Ch. 9, §5.2)

An additional complication consists in the fact that Blust finds PAn/PMP roots which differ
only in the voicing of the root-initial consonant and which have similar meanings. Since
PAn/PMP voicing distinctions were not retained in POc (§2.4), their reflexes are
indistinguishable in Oceanic languages. Thus POc _*tupu(k)_, _*tupu(k)-i-_ 'knock against',
apparently reflecting PMP _*tu(m)buk_ 'pound', is attributed by Blust (ACD) to the PAn root
_*-buk_ 'pound, thud, heavy splash' (Blust 1988: 87-88). POc _*sapu(k)_, _*sapu(k)-i-_ 'hit', on the
other hand, apparently reflecting PMP _*sa(m)puk_ 'collide, bump into', is attributable to the
PAn root _*-puk_ 'throb, thud, clap, break' (Blust 1988: 87-88) (cognate sets in Ch. 9, §5.1).

   PAn monosyllabic roots probably ceased to be independent morphemes (if indeed they
ever were independent) sometime around the break-up of PAn, although they may well have
played a role in the phonaesthetics of daughter languages for some time after the break-up.
The other dead patterns I wish to consider, however, probably arose from morphology which
remained productive in Eastern Malayo-Polynesian until not long before the break-up of
POc. This is morphology which reflects the Austronesian 'focus' system, variants of which
occur in many non-Oceanic Austronesian languages. I present the reconstructed systemic
changes first, then the instances of them, partly because the systemic changes also have a
bearing on POc nominal morphology, discussed in §3.2.1.

   The essence of the focus system is that the semantic role of the 'topic' (alias 'subject',
'nominative', 'pivot', 'trigger') of a verbal clause is indicated by an affix or affixes on the
verb.[21] The morphology of the PMP focus system was, at least roughly, as in (16).

[20] The double asterisks indicate that I do not know of non-Oceanic cognates which would independently
     support the PAn reconstructions.

[21] The question of how 'focus' systems should best be described has a long and controversial
history. A good basic description of such a system is provided by Schachter (1987).

The symbol √ represents the verb root and <…> an infix after the root-initial consonant. PMP
_-N-_ represents an underlying velar nasal which combined with a root-initial voiceless obstruent
to give the homorganic nasal, and with a root-initial voiced obstruent to give either the
homorganic nasal or a nasal + obstruent sequence:

__pre__
(17) *paN- + *takaw 'steal'         ->      *panakaw 'steal (actor focus)'
     *paN- + *deŋeR 'hear'          ->      *pandeŋeR 'hear (actor focus)'

The systemic features relevant to this discussion are that (i) there were two sets of verb
forms, the first used in indicative independent clauses and the other in non-indicative
independent and dependent clauses; and (ii) those in the first set were formally identical with
nominalisations. However, there were probably no nominalisations corresponding with the
actor focus forms.

   The historical relationship between the PMP and simpler POc system has intrigued various
scholars (Pawley & Reid 1980, Starosta, Pawley & Reid 1982, Wolff 1980). The POc
system in (18) is set out in such a way that it corresponds with (16).

The stages by which the PMP system became the POc system lie beyond the scope of this
chapter (Ross 1997 provides a hypothesised sequence), but the main changes (not necessarily
in diachronic order) were:

a)      Instrument or beneficiary focus *√-án was replaced by *√-aki[ni]-. This change is also
        reflected in many languages in Indonesia.
b)      PMP patient focus forms were lost, and the function of location focus forms was
        extended to include patient focus. These forms became the POc transitives.
c)     The PMP indicative independent verbal forms lost their verbal functions and remained
        only as nominalisers, leaving the erstwhile non-indicative/dependent verbal forms as the
        only verbal forms.

   Note that the verbal morphology reconstructed in the rightmost column of (18) is what has
been described in §3.1.2. The only additions are the parenthesised forms, representing possible
fossils. Evidence for these is given in (19).

        *buni           *muni              *puni-, *muni-   'hide (VT)'

In POc _*panako_ and _*paŋan_, we have clear cases where *paN- is preserved. The pair _*paŋan_
and _*kani_ is evidence that some relic of the focus system may have continued to exist until
shortly before the break-up of POc, _*paŋan_ reflecting the actor focus in this sytem, _*kani_ the
patient focus. This in turn allows us to intepret the POc pairs _*sopi_, _*ñopi_ etc. in (19) as
patient/actor pairs. Note, however, that this interpretation is not watertight. First, the expected
outcome of _*-N-raŋ_ is _**draŋ_, not _*naŋ_. Second, _*ñopi_ 'suck' displays both initial _*ñ-_ and
suffixed _*-i-_, i.e. the morphology of both actor and patient focus simultaneously.[22]

   A third set of morphological fossils also seems to date from the pre-POc period and may
also be associated with the focus system. We find a number of POc verbs, mainly in Chapter
9, where the data support the reconstruction of a pair of forms differing in the grade (oral or
nasal; cf. §2.4) of their initial consonant. For the verbs in (20), the data justify the reconstruction
of two forms. For those in (21), the case is not quite so clear, but there are forms which
indicate that there may also have been a POc form with a nasal-grade initial.

[22] This doubling up of morphology has at least two possible explanations. One, _*-i-_ was added to
_**ñop_ by analogy after the focus system had collapsed. Two, the system reconstructed in (21) is
wrong and the pre-POc system was more like that of a number of Indonesian languages, where reflexes of
_*maN-_ and _*-i_ co-occur in a single verb form. The evidence to date is too thin to permit a choice.

     *sapu(t), *saput-i- 'pull out, up, pluck'      Roviana zapu 'pull coconuts from a tree'

The pairs _*p_/_*b_, _*k_/_*g_, _*s_/_*j_ and _*r_/_*dr_ are represented in (20) and (21). Differences in
token frequency are probably largely attributable to differences in the frequency of these
consonants across POc vocabulary as a whole. The other logically possible pair _*t_/_*d_ is not
represented, but this reflects the fact that word-initial occurrences of _*d_ were either rare or
zero (§2.2).

     A salient fact about these pairs is that there are generally more reflexes with the oral-grade
alternant than the nasal-grade. This suggests that the nasal-grade alternants reflect
morphologically marked forms of the unmarked oral-grade forms. If this is correct, then we
have to ask whether all POc verb roots had an unmarked form with an initial oral-grade
consonant. The answer seems to be a qualified 'yes'. Exceptions occurred when a noun with
an initial nasal-grade consonant was used as a verb, e.g. POc _*buku_ 'node, knot, protuberance'
was used as the verb _*buku_ (VI), _*bukuti_ (VT) 'tie (a knot); fasten'. Otherwise we find, in
Chapter 9 for example, that the large majority of reconstructed POc verbs begin with an
oral-grade consonant. A few, like POc _*baba(k)_, _*baki-_ 'strike one against another, knock',
begin with a nasal-grade initial, and I have no explanation for these other than to speculate
that an oral grade-initial root occurred but is not reflected in our data.

     If the suggestion of the previous paragraph is correct, then we are looking for a morphological
alternation that ceased to be productive shortly before the break-up of POc. Initial nasal-grade
consonants (which did not occur in this position in PMP) arose from a sequence of nasal +
obstruent. That is, _*b_, _*g_, _*dr_, _*j_ developed from pre-POc _*mp_, _*ŋk_, _*nr_, _*ns_ (and _*nc_)
(§2.4). It is only a short step to infer that this nasal feature was the actor focus morpheme
_*-N-_ seen in (16) and (18) and that these pairs are systemically parallel to those in (19). But
we should be wary of making this inference too quickly. PMP nasal + obstruent sequences
occurred in actor focus verbs only when the root-initial obstruent was voiced, as illustrated in
(17). If the nasal feature in the voiced-initial members of the pairs in (16) and (18) really was
_*-N-_, then we would expect to find that they were all descended from PMP voiced-initial
roots. But when the known PMP ancestors of these pairs are listed against them, we find that
they often have a voiceless initial obstruent:

       *kawit, kawit-i- 'hook, catch hold of'          *kawit

This means that instead of the pair _*kiri_/_*giri_, for example, descended from PMP
voiceless-initial _*kirkir_, we would expect a pair _*kiri_/_**ŋiri_, corresponding to the pairs in the lower half
of (19). But the only such pairs I have found are those in (19). Thus, although I cannot
exclude the possibility that the pairs in (16) and (18) reflect a feature of the focus system, I
am unable to give a principled account of them.[23]

[23] Explanations might include (i) errors in the association of POc and PMP reconstructions, i.e.
more items in (23) and (24) are descended from voiced-initial PMP roots than is apparent (unlikely, as
PMP _*g-_ had a very low functional load); (ii) some unrecognised developments had occurred in the
pre-POc focus system; (iii) the nasal feature came not from PMP _*-N-_ but from PMP _*<um>_ in (19),
i.e. the POc system in (21) is incorrectly reconstructed.


2.3.2 Nouns

   Nouns had a valency of either one or zero. A monovalent noun normally took a suffix
which cross-referenced the person and number of the dependent noun phrase, usually its
possessor, e.g. POc _*tama-gu_ 'my father', _*tama-na_ 'her/his father' (cf. Bali-Vitu, Tolai,
Fijian _tama-gu_, _tama-na_), _*tama-na tamʷata_ 'the man's father'. I assume that, as in many
modern languages, the dependent noun phrase usually occurred only if it was third person,
and was optionally omissible even there.[24] A zero-valency noun had no affixation, e.g. POc
_*Rumaq_ 'house' (Ch. 3, §3.3). Monovalent nouns were nouns that are possessed by default:
they included kin terms (like _*tama-_ 'father'), body parts (e.g. POc _*qaqe-_ 'leg') or parts of
wholes (e.g. POc _*gabʷari-_ 'area underneath a raised house' (Ch. 3, §3.4)), and are shown in
reconstructions and supporting data with a final hyphen. Zero-valency nouns were all other
nouns. These two subclasses are reflected in numerous Oceanic languages, and are referred
to in grammars either by the semantic labels 'inalienable noun' and 'alienable noun' or, since
Lichtenberk (1985a), by the syntactic labels 'directly possessed noun' and 'indirectly possessed
noun'.

[24] When a monovalent noun had a non-specific possessor, it was evidently linked to the latter by
the preposition _*qi_, e.g. _*natu qi boRok_ 'piglet' (lit. 'child of pig'), but there is
considerable evidence that _*qi_ was bound to the preceding monovalent noun (cf, for example,
Seimat (Admiralties) _nat-i pou_ 'piglet'; see Hooper 1985 for further evidence).
A description of the (quite complex) POc possessive system is beyond our scope. The interested
reader is referred to Pawley (1973:153-169), Lichtenberk (1985a), Hooper (1985), Lynch (1996a).


2.3.2.1 Derivational morphology of nouns

   Morphemes which derive nouns have rather a complex history in Oceanic. As noted above
(§3.1.3), PMP nominalisations were identical to certain independent indicative forms of the
verb. These are repeated in (23), with examples based on the root _*kaʔen_ 'eat' to illustrate
how the system apparently worked. The meanings based on the focus labels are the probable
central meanings of these nominalisations: as in the modern languages, each affix must have
had other senses too.


                                                                         Phonology and grammar       33

                                                           *k<in>aʔen 'thing eaten'

Instrument            i-√              (i-<in>√)        *i-kaʔen 'thing one eats with'

The affix combination *i-<in>√ is parenthesised because I know of no reflexes of it as a
nominaliser. Reflexes of *<in>√-an are known only from Oceanic, and may reflect a local
innovation.

   The corresponding POc nominalisations are tabulated in (24). Although the verbal focus
system had disappeared in POc, it is reasonably clear that the nominalising morphology
continued to be associated with semantic roles:

__pre__
(24) POc              nominalisation
                      imperfective perfective              *kani 'eat'
Patient               (√-on)           <in>√           *kano'1 'thing to be eaten, food'
                                                          *k<imani 'thing eaten'
Location              √-an             <in>√-an         *kan-an, *kana'1 'place where one eats'
                                                          *k<iman-an 'place where one has eaten'
Instrument            i-√                               *i-kani 'thing one eats with'

The affix combination _*√-on_ is parenthesised because it survived only in fossilised forms like
POc _*kanoŋ(a)_ 'flesh, meat, coconut flesh' (Ross 1996d: 174). However, it is clear that the
rest of the system remained productive in POc (and much of it remains productive in various
modern languages), as _*<in>_ and _*i-_, at least, were evidently added to the productive POc root,
e.g. _*kani_, not the stem *kan reflecting PMP _*kaʔen_. However, it is less clear that this is true
of _*-an_.

   Instrumental _*i-√_ has kept its PMP function, e.g. _*asa(q)_ 'grate', _*asaq-i-_ 'grate (s.t.)';
_*i-asa(q)_ 'grater' (Ch. 9, §2.1). It has been lost in a number of languages, however, sometimes
where it was in competition with initial-syllable reduplication, which also formed instruments.

   I noted in §3.1.3 that the function of location focus forms was extended to include patient
focus. This also happened to a degree with nominalisations, in that _*√-on_ survives only in
fossils. However, its perfective counterpart _*<in>√_ survives as patient and general nominaliser
in Mussau and the Meso-Melanesian cluster.[25] In Roviana and Hoava (MM) the general
nominaliser is _<in>_, e.g. Roviana _k<in>era_ 'song' from _kera_ 'sing', whilst _*-an_ retains its local
meaning, e.g. Roviana _huhuve-ana_ 'bathing place, bath' from _huhuve_ 'bathe' (Roviana preserves
POc final consonants with a following echo vowel, so _-ana_ is the regular reflex of _*-an_). In
other languages the reflex of the erstwhile locational _*√-an_ has taken over the function of
general nominaliser, so that some reflexes of POc _*mate-an_, e.g. Vitu (MM) _mate-a_, Longgu
(SES) _mae-a-_, _mean_ 'death', rather than 'deathbed' or 'cemetery'. The affix combination
_*<in>√-an_ is reflected in fossilised reflexes of POc _*k<in>ani-ana_ 'food' in the languages of
Epi (central Vanuatu) (Tryon 1976:289).

[25] Zero-derivation or reduplication is also used to form deverbal nouns in a number of languages.

34      Malcolm Ross


   The history of _*√-an_ as a nominaliser in Oceanic has several complications. First, as
_*kanaŋ_ and _*kanoŋ_ above indicate, forms in final _*-ŋ_ occurred in POc alongside those in
final _*-n_, so _*√-an_ and _*√-aŋ_ apparently coexisted, a fact for which I have no explanation.
Secondly, there is good evidence that both also occurred with an additional _*-a_, i.e. as _*√-ana_
and _*√-aŋa_. The only known language where a contrast has been found between forms
without and with _-a_ is Mangseng (NNG), where _-ŋ_ is the general nominaliser, _-ŋ-a_ the
instrumental formative (e.g. _puno-ŋ_ (N) 'fight', _puno-ŋ-a_ 'weapon ', both from _pun_ (V)
'fight'). This suggests that the forms with _*-a_ may have had a separate function in POco

   Forms reflecting _*√-an_ and _*√-aŋ_ can be disambiguated only in languages which preserve
POc final consonants faithfully, and in fact only two such languages are known to reflect
_*√-an_. These are Roviana and Hoava, as illustrated above. However, if reflexes of _*√-ana_
are also taken as evidence of POc _*√-an_, then there are a number of these in the Admiralties,
e.g. Seimat _paku-an_[26] (N) 'dance', from _pak_ (V) 'dance', and in Central and South Vanuatu,
e.g. Paamese _sau-ene_ 'singing' from _sau_ 'sing', Lenakel _akar_ 'talk' from _n-akar-aan_ 'talking'
(where _n-_ reflects a POc article _*na_).

    Forms reflecting _*√-aŋ_ are found in languages of the NNG cluster. Here, however, there
is a different complication, namely that _*√-aŋ_ and _*√-aŋa_ are reflected as _*√-ŋ_ and _*√-ŋa_,
e.g. _*mate-aŋa_ 'death' is replaced by _*mate-ŋa_, getting rid of the vowel sequence in favour of
the strongly CV canonic shape of early Oceanic (§2.2). This is evidently a local innovation.
Thus we find, for example, Lukep-Pono _kani-ŋ_ 'yam' (from _*kani_ 'eat'), Gitua _gururu-ŋ_ (N)
'thunder' (from _*guru_ (v) 'thunder').

    Forms reflecting _*√-aŋa_ and _*√-ŋa_ are well scattered, for example, Poeng (NNG) _mate-ŋa_
'death' (from _*mate_ 'die'), Mussau _palapala-ŋa_ (N) 'thunder' (from _*pʷaraq_ (V) 'thunder',
Samoan (Pn) _inum-aŋa_ 'draught, dose' (from _*inum_ 'drink'), _tafi-ŋa_ 'removal' (from _tafi_
'remove'), and throughout Polynesia.

    There is a wealth of languages in which final consonants are lost, so that both _*√-an_ and
_*√-aŋ_ are regularly reflected as _-a_, leaving us with no way of knowing which form was
ancestral (e.g. Loniu _he-ya_ 'washing' from _he_ 'wash'; Malo _dule-a_ 'clearing bush' from _dule_
'clear bush'). The Bali dialect of Bali-Vitu retains final consonants with a following echo
vowel, but neutralises POc _*-n_ and _*-ŋ_ as _-ŋ-_, so that the ancestral consonant is again
ambiguous (e.g. _moŋe-aŋa_ 'sleeping' from _moŋe_ 'sleep').

    In the light of these complications-and because we do not understand them well-we
reconstruct each nominalisation as the data require, with _*√-an_, _*√-aŋ_, _*√-ana_ or _*√-aŋa_ (or
on occasion _*√-ŋ_ or _*√-ŋa_), but recognising that this is probably not an accurate rendering of
the POc form. As I noted above, however, we find cognate sets which allow the reconstruction
of, say, both _*mate-an_ (or _*mate-aŋ_ or whatever) and _*m<in>ate_ 'death'. These pairs occur
almost certainly because the reflex of one of _*√-an_ (etc.) or _*<in>√_ has extended its productivity
at the expense of the other in various languages, creating the appearance that POc had both
forms. In such cases we reconstruct, e.g., POc _*mate_ ('die') + NOMINALISER 'death', as we
cannot tell which form was in fact lexicalised in POc.

[26] The presence of _-n_ attests the earlier presence of a following vowel.


2.3.3 Adjectival classes

                                                                         Phonology and grammar                35


   POc had no separate adjective class. Instead, it had a large class of adjectival verbs and a
small class of adjectival nouns (Ross 1998a). The class of adjectival verbs appears to have
included all U-statives, and at least some U intransitives (§3.1.1). Many reconstructed adjectival
verbs include the U intransitive prefix _*ma-_ (§3.1.2). Both adjectival verbs and adjectival
nouns could apparently follow the noun they modified without any morphological marking,
but their behaviour differed in the predicate. There, an adjectival verb behaved like any
intransitive verb, whilst an adjectival noun behaved as a (zero-valency) noun whose property
is attributed to a referent or referents. Thus POc _*saqat_ 'bad' was an adjectival verb, _*paqoRu_
'new' an adjectival noun. Either could modify a noun: POc _*a Rumaq saqat_ 'a bad house',
POc _*a Rumaq paqoRu_ 'a new house' (where _*a_ was a common article). Compare Bali-Vitu
_a rumaka zaɣata_ and _a rumaka vaɣoru_ (Bali-Vitu is a conservative Oceanic language of the
Meso-Melanesian cluster). However, as predicates they behaved differently, probably as in
the Bali-Vitu examples below, where _zaɣata_ 'bad' is a verb preceded by the proclitic _ti_, a
portmanteau marker of third person subject and perfective aspect, whilst _vaɣoru_ 'new' is
preceded by the article _a_ and means 'a new one'.
(25) Bali-Vitu:

__pre__
        a. A       vaga  beini  ti           zaɣata.
           ARTICLE canoe that   PERFECTlVE:3 bad
           'That canoe is broken.'

__pre__
        b. A       rumaka beini a       vaɣoru.
           ARTICLE house  that  ARTICLE new
           'That house is new.'



2.4 Assigning reconstructions to word classes

   Although we know with reasonable certainty what the open word classes were in POc and
what their major subclasses were,[27] we cannot always assign a reconstructed etymon to a
single word class or subclass. Some items, of course, like _*tama-_ 'father', _*Rumaq_ 'house'
and _*kinit-i-_, are easily assigned: they are, respectively, a monovalent noun, a zero-valency
noun and a transitive verb. Quite a number of the items we reconstruct are derived items, and
their morphology allows us to assign them to a class. Relevant morphemes are described
above in §3.1.2 and §3.2.1, Other items, especially zero-valency nouns and intransitive verbs,
the comparative evidence suggests, could readily serve in more than one word class without
any morphological change. Thus in cases like POc *(p,pʷ)anaq (N) 'bow', (VI) 'shoot' (Ch. 8 ,
§9) we assume that the etymon served as both a noun and verb in POc.

   In other cases our data sources simply give insufficient or inaccurate information about
word class and subclass memberships, so that we often do not know whether a disyllabic
vowel-final verb base in a given language is transitive, intransitive or both. In the case of
adjectival nouns and adjectival verbs, we cannot always be sure which of the two subclasses
an etymon belonged to. Confronted with situations of this kind, we have not always attempted
formally to assign POc etyma to their word classes, but allow our glosses and the hyphenation
conventions referred to in the discussion above to speak for themselves.

3 Architectural forms and settlement patterns

3.1  Aims and methodological preliminaries

   This chapter seeks to reconstruct something of the architectural elements and settlement
patterns of speakers of Proto Oceanic and its immediate descendants, speech communities
that many associate with the colonisation of south-west Oceania by bearers of the archaeological
culture known as Lapita in the second half of the 2nd millennium BC (Bellwood 1978,
Pawley & Ross 1995, Shutler & Marck 1975, Spriggs 1995).[1]

   Some methodological questions are in order. Are such culture historical reconstructions
feasible? Which disciplines and methods can provide evidence relevant to this task? What is
each method good for, and to what extent, if at all, can evidence provided by different
methods be connected?

   At least three distinct disciplines - historical linguistics, archaeology and comparative
ethnology - are used to do culture history. Each discipline has particular strengths and
limitations.[2] Although their combined testimonies are likely to reveal a fuller picture than any
yielded by a single discipline, synthesising evidence from diverse disciplines and methods is
not a straightforward matter. A synthesiser can accept the testimony of different disciplines
but it is not easy to know when the witnesses are talking about the same historical events.
One is reminded of the story of the six blind philosophers each of whom touched a different
part of an elephant and then equated the parts with six unrelated objects.

The richest primary data for culture historical reconstruction come from comparative
ethnology (or comparative ethnography, if you prefer). This discipline has the advantage,
under favourable circumstances, of starting with descriptions of contemporary or historical
societies and cultures that are immensely more complete than anything the archaeologist can
hope to recover. However, the historical method of comparative ethnology is a fairly blunt
instrument.[3] The method is based on general arguments from typology. From contemporary
reports of cultures the comparative ethnologist may arrive at a theory of earlier cultural types
and their transformations or their directions of diffusion. The proofs for drawing such inferences
are essentially statistical, based on the frequency and distribution of types and typological
associations in contemporary societies: often the most common and/or most widely distributed
type is assumed to be the oldest. A problem familiar to archaeologists and linguists who use
ethnographic analogy is that the reconstructed past becomes simply an extension and reflection
of one's knowledge of present-day traditional societies. Quite different pasts are not easily
recognised.

[1] This chapter is based on a longer paper by Green and Pawley (in press, vol. 3) which correlates archaeological
   findings from Lapita sites with the linguistic work presented here. The current version includes some minor
   revisions and the archaeological data are omitted here, as the aim of the present series is to reconstruct POc
   lexicon without attempting to treat archaeological evidence in any detail. We are indebted to Meredith
   Osmond for research assistance and comments. Peter Sheppard, Richard Walter, Janet Davidson, Patrick
   Kirch, Malcolm Ross and Valerie Green also read the draft and suggested a number of improvements.

[2] Blust (1976b) points out ways in which archaeological and linguistic evidence can be complementary,
    corroboratory or contradictory.

38       Roger Green and Andrew Pawley

   The following remarks by Waterson (1993: 221) about the antiquity of houses on piles and
roof styles are fairly typical of the kinds of argumentation used by historical ethnologists:

|     Architectural styles can change rapidly - but they can also maintain continuity over surprisingly
|     long periods. The antiquity of some aspects of architectural style in the Austronesian world
|     is undoubted. Elements such as pile building and the saddle roof with its extended ridge line
|     are first to be seen on the bronze drums of the Dong Son era, but to judge from their
|     appearance in regions as distant from the [Southeast Asian] mainland as Micronesia and
|     New Guinea, it is reasonable to assume they are much older than their earliest surviving
|     pictorial representations; in other words, that this style is a genuinely Austronesian invention.

In her two-volume work, _Kulthäuser in Nordneuguinea_, Hauser-Schäublin (1989: 618) writes
as follows of houses in a region that contains hundreds of non-Austronesian languages as
well as a smaller number of Austronesian languages:

|     The hut on piles with supports carrying both the roof and the built-in floor seems to belong
|     to Austronesian cultures. On the North Coast both elements are combined: the first floor
|     platform is supported by its own poles, whereas the upper floors are slotted into the horizontal
|     beams. In areas settled by non-Austronesian groups, all parts of the building are traditionally
|     lashed with lianas. Pin and peg techniques are only known in those regions where Austronesian
|     languages are spoken. The Middle Sepik cultures took over the idea of buildings with
|     projecting gables from the Austronesians who settled at certain places on the North Coast.
|     They adapted it to their own technology and architectural experience, giving it a new expression.
|     [translated from the German, in Waterson 1993]

   Note the temporal priorities assigned in these two accounts. The conclusions about what is
older and younger based on ethnological distributions may well be valid, but how much
confidence can we place in them? The same reservations apply to conclusions about directions
of diffusion. A serious weakness of comparative ethnology, as an instrument for doing
prehistory, is that it has no very reliable way of distinguishing between shared resemblances
among a set of contemporary cultures that are due to (a) retention from a common ancestral
tradition, (b) convergent development, or (c) diffusion.

   In a different context, Bellwood has remarked that "only archaeology will tell us for
certain whether pile-built dwellings really belong to an early phase of Western Austronesian
culture, or whether they have been diffused at a much later date…" (Bellwood 1987:92). As
we shall see, in that particular matter, historical linguistics can also provide crucial evidence.


[3]  The nature of the contrast between the historical methods of comparative ethnology and
linguistics is discussed in Blust (1980a), Green (l 994a) and Pawley and Ross (1993, 1995).

                                         Architecturalforms and settlement patterns            39

    Granted these caveats, the evidence of comparative ethnology can at times be very suggestive.
Thus it forms one of the more fruitful sources of testable interpretations about the recent past
and of analogical inferences employed by archaeologists in their reconstructions. Such evidence
can provide a useful constraint on the semantic reconstructions proposed by linguists. For
example, in his study of Austronesian terms for 'house', Blust (1987) gave good reasons for
glossing POc _*kamali(R)_ as 'men's house'. He then proposed to extend this gloss back to
Proto Malaya-Polynesian (PMP). However, Fox (1993) and Waterson (1993) give ethnographic
arguments for rejecting this last proposal. A building specifically for men alone to use as a
meeting and sleeping place and for ritual activities is common among Austronesian societies
only in parts of Melanesia. Fox (1993: 12) suggests, reasonably, that the institution of a
men's house was not part of original Austronesian or Malayo-Polynesian culture, but was
borrowed by early Oceanic speakers from non-Austronesian speaking peoples of Melanesia.

   The great advantage of prehistoric archaeology over comparative ethnology and historical
linguistics is that it can locate particular assemblages of structural and portable artefacts
more precisely in space and time. However, archaeologists must generally make do with
extremely fragmentary data. The portable artefacts recovered are typically confined to durable
items of material culture while those of the structural kind require extensive excavations of
the remnants of structures and the below-ground imprints of features. Often only a very
small sample of the range of a society's entire material culture is recovered and inferences
about the rest of the culture-including its systems of beha viour and belief -must be made on
indirect grounds.

   The strengths and weaknesses of historical linguistics are largely complementary to those
of archaeology and comparative ethnology. Like ethnologists, linguists draw their primary
data from reports of contemporary or historical language-culture systems. They lack truly
reliable methods for placing in space or absolute time the languages and linguistic events they
reconstruct. Unlike comparative ethnology, however, historical linguistics has a method for
reconstructing prehistoric events that is quite distinct from typology. (Strictly speaking, it has
a theory, which underlies a set of established procedures for interpreting data, including
techniques for evaluating competing interpretations.) This method or theory derives its force
from the fact that in all languages the code for forming minimal signs (morphemes) is
arbitrary, i.e. the conventions for pairing form (pronunciation) and meaning in morphemes
are not based on functional considerations. For this reason, unrelated languages are unlikely
to show anything more than occasional resemblances in their morphemes, unless there has
been borrowing between them. Languages, like organisms, are highly integrated systems and
certain elements in the system - particular sounds and particular morphemes - show a continuity
over time that may usefully be called 'genetic'. These continuities are traceable in spite of
changes in the form of these elements across generations of speakers.

   The special nature of linguistic systems and linguistic change gives linguists a powerful
method for reconstructing the histories of related words (cognates) shared by sister languages.
In any language the sounds and meanings of the words of a language undergo constant,
though normally gradual, change. In time, over many thousands of years, all languages will
change beyond recognition if they continue to be spoken at all. Paradoxically, it is precisely
this fragility of linguistic artefacts, together with the regular nature of one kind of linguistic
change, which makes it possible (i) to distinguish genetic relationship from other kinds of
resemblances and (ii) to determine subgrouping or family tree relationships within genetic
stocks. Regular change is characteristic of sound systems. In a socially homogeneous speech
community, pronunciations tend to change regularly, such that if in some words the sound x
changes to y under certain structural conditions, say [t] to [s] before [i], or [p] to [v] between
vowels, that change will generally extend to all words that meet those structural conditions.
However, words borrowed from a sister language or dialect after the change x to y is
complete usually will not undergo that change and, in that case, will be detectable as anomalous.

40      Roger Green and Andrew Pawley

   The weakest link in linguistic reconstructions is meaning. Semantic change is not regular
or systematic in the way that sound change is, and when cognates in languages A, B, C, etc.
exhibit a diverse range of meanings, it may be difficult to determine the original meaning(s).
Some of the procedures linguists adopt to constrain semantic reconstruction are discussed in
Blust (1987). How linguists approach these issues and the problems they pose for archaeologists
who wish to use such reconstructions is discussed in Green (1994a).

   The linguistic comparative method works well only at fairly shallow time depths because
cumulative change wears away the evidence of common origin. There have been few cases in
which the genetic comparative method has reliably penetrated much deeper than about 6,000
years. No special mystique should be attached to this particular figure - it happens that
several of the large, well-defined language families in the world are the outcome of dispersals
that began within the last 5,000 to 6,000 years.[4] When the relevant cognate sets survive, the
reconstructions for prehistoric 'artefacts' and 'ecofacts' accessible to historical linguistics
cover an extremely wide range of cultural domains - so this discipline is well equipped to
recover elements of the perishable material often unavailable to archaeologists as well as
cognitive aspects of social organisation, beliefs, and ideology that archaeologists find difficult
to infer. However, historical linguistics must look to archaeology to supplement its relatively
weak methods for locating reconstructed prehistoric languages in space and in absolute time.

   But here an old problem arises: How can reconstructed languages be correlated with
archaeological assemblages? For instance, how can one make a strong claim about whether a
particular Lapita site was occupied by Austronesian speakers or by non-Austronesian speakers?
Aren't there culture areas where people speaking different, indeed unrelated, languages share
very similar material cultures? Welch et al. (1992) certainly make such a claim concerning
the Sepik coast (and Lapita), but things have not turned out to be as clearcut as they supposed
(cf. Moore & Romney 1994, 1995, Roberts, Moore & Romney 1995). The answer is that we
can confidently make the Austronesian-Lapita association only when one or more of the
following conditions are met: (a) when there is good evidence for believing that Austronesian
speakers were the only people to inhabit a region in prehistoric times - as is the case in, say,
Micronesia, Fiji and Polynesia - or at least around the time in question, as appears to be the
case in, say, the area of Central Papua around Port Moresby 2,000 years ago; (b) when there
is well-established continuity between the prehistoric site or sites in question and recent,
historically documented Austronesian-speaking communities in the region; (c) in the case of
regions known to have been inhabited by both Austronesian and non-Austronesian speakers,
when the material culture of Austronesian speakers is sharply distinct from that of non-Austronesian
speakers. And if a site was occupied by Austronesian speakers, we may ask
how it can be shown that the occupants were speakers of, say, stage A or subgroup A of
Austronesian rather than stage B or subgroup B. The short answer is that this is a complicated
business that involves taking account of the distribution of subgroups, continuities and
discontinuities in the archaeological sequence, and geographic, demographic and political
factors.

[4]  It has been suggested that the expansion of many of the world's large, well-defined language
groups was associated with the spread of agriculture (Bellwood 1991, Renfrew 1987, 1992). Be that
as it may, reconstruction of fairly remote protolanguages is certainly easiest when the number
of descendants is large, as is the case with such well-known families as Indo-European (at least
140 languages) and Austronesian (about 1,000 languages). The conservativeness of a good many
Austronesian languages is such that, if they were to change no more over the next 5,000 years
than they have in the past 5,000 or so, their genetic relatedness would still be obvious, some
10,000 years after their divergence.

    Our strategy, since the mid-1960s, has been to seek detailed, systematic points of connection
between particular prehistoric cultures and cultural sequences in the Pacific Islands, as defined
by archaeology and historical linguistics, respectively, always with an eye on the comparative
ethnology.[5] The islands of the Polynesian Triangle, settled so late in human history, have been
an ideal laboratory to make such correlations. In Melanesia, a region with a far more complex
prehistory, but receiving far less attention, the pieces have not come together nearly so well.
But over the past 30 years it has gradually become increasingly evident that the settlement of
Near Oceania by Austronesian speakers preceded the first Austronesian settlement of Remote
Oceania by only a few hundred years.

    Between 1500 and 1000 BC variants of a culture known as Lapita appear in the
archaeological record across a wide belt in the Southwest and Central Pacific (Allen & Gosden 1991, 
Galipaud 1992, Green 1967, 1979, 1994a, Kirch & Hunt 1988, Spriggs 1990, 1995, 1996; see Map 5). 
The chief markers of Lapita sites are well-made earthenware
with a characteristic variety of vessel shapes, with some vessels decorated by very distinctive,
elaborate dentate-stamped geometric motifs. Lapita pottery is usually associated with other
features. Settlements are in the hamlet-to-village range and nearly always situated on small
islands or on the coast of large islands and handy to beaches that would provide good
launching sites for boats. The Lapita tool kit frequently contains ground and polished stone
and shell adzes; obsidian and chert flake tools, often imported from remote sources; one-piece
shell fishhooks; pearlshell knives and scrapers; various kinds of conus shell disks and pendants;
earth ovens; and middens full of lagoon fish and turtle bones and also containing the bones of
dog, chicken and pig.

    The earliest Lapita sites are in the Bismarck Archipelago. There the distinctive pottery
style appears suddenly, full blown, around 1500 BC. No exact match has yet been found
outside of Oceania but the ultimate antecedents of Lapita probably lie further west, in
Indonesia and Southeast Asia, where broadly similar pottery traditions can be found, although
these lack the complex decorative style characteristic of Lapita. In the Bismarcks, the earliest
Lapita pottery style is known as Early or Far Western Lapita. After 1200 BC it was replaced
in that region by a style, known as Western Lapita, with modified vessel forms and decorative
patterns which continued in some sites up till about 500 BC. A slightly modified form of
Western Lapita pottery was present in sites in Santa Cruz, Vanuatu and New Caledonia by 1200 BC.
By 1200-1000 BC another variant, known as Eastern Lapita, appears in Fiji,
Tonga and Samoa.

[5]  For example, Green (1966, 1967, 1979, 1981, 1986, 1994a, 1994b); Kirch and Green (1987);
Pawley (1981, 1982a, 1996a); Pawley and R.Green (1973, 1984); Pawley and K.Green (1971);
Pawley and Pawley (1994); Pawley and Ross (1993). We have not been alone in this enterprise.
From the 1920s on, Kenneth Emory was a pioneer in Polynesian culture history, when archaeological
and historical linguistic studies in that region were in their infancy and the main reliance was
on comparative ethnology. For more recent interdisciplinary work see Bellwood (1978, 1985, 1987, 1991);
Blust (1976b, 1980a, 1984-85, 1994);

   On currently favoured subgrouping hypotheses, the likeliest dispersal centre for the Oceanic
subgroup was the Bismarck Archipelago (Pawley & Ross 1993, 1995, Ross 1988; cf. also
Grace 1961, 1964). This conclusion is consistent with the view that the break-up of Proto
Oceanic (POc) was associated with the dispersal of the Lapita culture beyond the Bismarcks
after about 1300 BC.

   Throughout Remote Oceania the appearance of the Lapita culture can be associated with
the first arrival in the region of Austronesian languages, specifically members of the Oceanic
subgroup. The connections are easiest to make in Fiji and Western Polynesia, regions that
almost certainly were not inhabited by humans before the bearers of the Lapita culture
arrived. In Fiji and Polynesia there is a continuity of tradition, with more or less gradual
change, from Eastern Lapita material culture to later archaeological cultures that are clearly
ancestral to recent, historically documented cultures. Comparable continuities are harder to
demonstrate in parts of Remote Oceania west of Fiji, where the archaeological record has
become more complex, but a strong case can still be made there for the Lapita-Oceanic
Austronesian association (Green 1997).


3.2. Settlement patterns: evidence from archaeology and comparative ethnology

    The archaeological record tells us much about the siting and size of Lapita sites. All 36
sites of known size are on the coast (see Map 5), usually handy to lagoons and beaches that
would have provided seafood and canoe landing and launching places. Settlements cover the
typical Oceanic ethnographic range from hamlets to small villages, though a few are larger
(the largest being 72,500 m²) (Green 1994b). But what does archaeology tell us of the internal
organisation of Lapita settlements? Disappointingly little. Although the size of most Lapita
living sites has been calculated from surface features, such as the distribution of potsherds,
only a few sites have been extensively excavated. Thus, reconstructions of the internal
organisation of Lapita settlements rest mainly on a few large-scale investigations of portions
of settlement areas (e.g. Best 1984, Frimigacci 1974, 1980, Kirch 1988, Poulsen 1987,
Sheppard & Green 1991).

   The ethnological record on settlement patterns and architecture in Austronesian-speaking
societies is far too extensive to review here. Our remarks must be very brief and selective.
We will use selected ethnological evidence and a comparative approach mainly to generate
hypotheses that might be tested against evidence from archaeology and/or linguistics.

   For example, certain features of Austronesian settlements in Oceania were so widespread
at first European contact, that one may reasonably ask whether these directly continued
traditions established during the initial dispersal of Oceanic languages. Recurrent features
noted in the literature (Forge 1972, Hogbin & Wedgewood 1953, Oliver 1989) include those
set out below.

44     Roger Green and Andrew Pawley

__ul__
(1) There is a preference for coastal settlements, handy to reef/lagoon systems and beaches with landing places for boats, and to garden land in the interior.
(2) Both dispersed and nucleated settlements are common. Dispersed settlements, sometimes containing hamlets inhabited by a few extended families, are commonest where land is plentiful. Nucleated settlements, consisting of villages of up to 300 people, are invariably found when land is in short supply and, where attacks are feared, settlements may be situated in inaccessible places with defences constructed.
(3) In villages where the terrain allows, main dwellings are generally arranged in parallel lines on each side of a rectangular space that serves as a ceremonial centre for the settlement.
(4) Villages divide into sections or wards each belonging to a single lineage (or section of a lineage) and containing one or more households.
(5) The sections are not physically bounded but each lineage owns certain house sites and these sites have considerable ritual importance.
(6) Each family or extended family has a rectangular main house, which in western Melanesia is generally raised on piles; but in eastern Melanesia, nuclear Micronesia and Polynesia comes in both rectangular, oval, and round forms and is usually (there are some exceptions in Micronesia) built on the ground or, in some regions, on a flat mound.
(7) Main dwelling houses have two-section thatched roofs with high gable. This relatively heavy superstructure is supported by large posts and beams.
(8) There is a porch in the front of raised houses and often on those built on the ground.
(9) The interior of the main dwelling is divided into compartments with an inner room or compartment for sleeping and an outer 'living room'.
(10) While main houses serve as sleeping places and as storage places for valuables, much daily life takes place in smaller, less durable structures erected on the ground near the main dwelling and used for various daytime activities such as preparing food, cooking, eating, weaving mats, conversation with neighbours and sometimes for sleeping in at night. These structures, including kitchen and day-houses, are less well built, being open-sided or only partly walled, often with flat roofs of coconut leaves or rough thatching.
(11) Coastal settlements have open-sided boat houses, each usually belonging to an extended family.
(12) In yam-growing areas there are storage houses with raised platforms for keeping yams; similar structures often occur elsewhere.
(13) In parts of Melanesia a men's house is commonly part of the hamlet or village, providing a centre where men and boys may congregate and perform certain rituals from which women are barred.
(14) A menstrual hut is sometimes built near the main dwelling of a family.
(15) Ovens made with heated stones, including both earth ovens (where the food is cooked in pits) and above-ground ovens, occur close to the dwellings.
(16) Graves, often marked by piles of stones, may be sited under or close to the main dwelling house.
(17) The ritual activity of kin groups is focused in dwelling houses. The principal ritual foci within the house are the posts, entrance, ridge-pole and hearth.

   In a passage cited earlier, Hauser-Schäublin (1989) discussed features of house design
among Austronesian peoples of the central north coast of New Guinea. Let us take another
example, from south-eastern New Guinea. The traditional dwelling houses of the people of
Goodenough Island in the D'Entrecasteaux group were, by Austronesian standards, extremely
modest structures, smaller and less elaborately constructed than the grander houses of many
regions. Yet they exhibit most of the basic structural features of dwelling houses among the
coastal Austronesian-speaking peoples living throughout the New Guinea area. The following
description (cited in Young 1993: 182) applies to the early contact period of 1911-12.

                                            Architecturalforms and settlement patterns                   45


|    All houses … are erected on four poles forked at the top to hold the plates … Two plates run
|   horizontally from the front to the back posts of the house, and from them a series of poles
|   and rafters lead up and support the ridge pole. Everything is firmly lashed together with
|   vines … Thus the framework of the house is provided; for walls it is covered with overlapping
|   layers of sago-leaf matting. Back and front are sometimes covered in the same way, but
|   often the matting is here replaced by planks on which the native can display his artistic
|   powers. The back wall is unbroken but a gap is left in the front by which the inmates can
|   enter; it can be closed at will by native mats. A platform is often built in front, usually as a
|   mere extension of the floor, though sometimes a foot or so lower. This … offers a very
|   convenient place to sit and gossip, especially when the roof and sides are made to project as
|    well and so ward off both sun and rain. Propped up against the platform … will be found a
|   ladder, which is simply the stem of a small tree with notches cut for steps at intervals of a
|   few inches. The floor is made of transverse poles or rough boards resting on the plates, and
|   is generally covered with mats of coconut leaves. The interior is sometimes divided into an
|   inner and an outer compartment, with a gap in the dividing wall similar to that in the front of
|   the house. In some houses there is a low bench running along one side, for the inmates to
|   sleep on, but this is not very common.

|        … A medium sized hut that we measured had a front of 22'6" (6.9 m) and a depth of 26'
|   (8 m). The platform, which extended 6' (1.8 m) outwards from the floor, was 5' (1.5 m) above
|   the ground, and the height of the room inside from floor to ridge-pole was only 4'8" (1.4 m)
|   (Jenness & Ballantyne 1920: 182-183).

   In his overview of domicile arrangements in Island Melanesia, Oliver (1989: 333) chose a
community of the Austronesian-speaking Baegu (Malaita, Solomon Islands) to "typify,
substantively, hundreds of Island Melanesia's thousands of communities" (New Guinea
communities are given separate treatment). Given his extensive ethnographic knowledge of
the region, and his objective in setting up a model to characterise most communities in it, the
selection of Baegu is, one would believe, no accident. And it suits well the need for a general
ethnographic guideline within which to work.

   Baegu communities consist of one or more _fera_ (or hamlets) (Ross 1973). Although _fera_
"had no visible boundaries and little symbolic identity, they remained more or less localised
and were distinctly perceptible in terms of social interactions of the members". Baegu local
communities become more 'solidary' under the influence of 'focal' men, clan seniors and
priests whose statuses were ascribed by birth, and feast givers and war leaders whose positions
were achieved.

   Note also the gender arrangements and symbolic structures of relations within and without
the _fera_, shown in Figure 2. Strikingly similar parallelism of inside-outside structural relations,
physical and symbolic, were noted by Goodenough (1983) for Malekula and the Polynesian
marae and by Green (1986: 54) for a Kwaio settlement in relation to Polynesian settlements.

3.2.1 Dwelling house architecture

   Most Oceanic-speaking societies distinguish by name more than one design of dwelling
house. Arosi speakers, of San Cristobal in the Solomons, for instance, first distinguish _ruma_
'a house, oblong in shape' from _hare_ 'a shed for yams, a house with roof thatched on one side
only, a shrine (a small house on poles)' and then distinguish at least the following kinds of
_ruma_ (Fox 1978):

__ul__
- _ruma huri_, a round house, taller than the well-known Santa Cruz round house
- _ruma gaura_, a double, oblong house
- _ruma ora_, a house with ten posts or more (five pairs of posts)
- _ruma pʷarapʷara_, a house roughly built, with roof of whole fronds instead of thatching
- _ruma rangi_, a house with two roofs, the second roof only above the upper part of the first roof, made by extending the rafters upwards
- _ruma rokera_, like ruma rangi but the two roofs close together
- _ruma sinakuhi_, house with rounded end
- _ruma waiho_, simplest form of oblong house with six posts (three pairs).

Are there significant structural differences between the houses and settlements of Austronesian
and non-Austronesian speakers in Melanesia? It is hazardous to generalise - in these matters
individual societies in Melanesia show considerable variation and in certain regions there has
been much cultural influence across linguistic boundaries. But if we exclude the most
problematic cases, the following generalisations about non-Austronesian societies seem to
apply rather widely. 

__ol__
(1) There is a preference for inland settlements. 
(2) Main dwelling houses are built on the ground, not on piles. 
(3) Houses are relatively small and lack a high, gabled roof requiring strong crossbeams and centre-posts. Instead, the roof is relatively low and flat or domed with the support of centre poles. 
(4) Timbers are lashed, and seldom secured by wooden pins or pegs. 
(5) There is no projecting gable. 
(6) There is no porch or raised open platform outside the room. 
(7) There is often a men's house. 
(8) Boat houses are absent. 
(10) Stone heated ovens, including earth ovens, are made close to the dwellings.

   The ethnological evidence suggests various questions for culture history. Can we show by
linguistic or archaeological evidence that these features were part of the settlement patterns
of Proto Oceanic speakers and their immediate descendants?


3.3. Settlement patterns: evidence from comparative linguistics

3.3.1 Subgrouping

   Given the minimal subgrouping assumptions set out in the Introduction, we can reconstruct
a Proto Oceanic etymon for any set of cognate lexical units that is regularly reflected in at
least one language in any two of the following subgroups or sets: (a) the Admiralties, (b)
Western Oceanic, (c) Eastern Oceanic, or in at least one Oceanic language and one non-Oceanic
Austronesian language.

48     Roger Green and Andrew Pawley

    Interstages later than Proto Oceanic are also of interest. Of particular concern are those
that might be associated with archaeologically discernible events, such as the first appearance
of the Lapita culture in certain regions or changes in architectural or settlement patterns.
Lapita appears in the Bismarck Archipelago between 1500 and 1300 BC and spread rapidly
south-east across the SW Pacific as far as Fiji and Western Polynesia. If the bearers of
Lapita spoke hardly differentiated dialects of Oceanic when they spread to the major
archipelagos of SW Melanesia, it should occasion no surprise that it is hard to find evidence
for subgroups that span different archipelagos in that region. What we do find is a number of
fairly well-defined subgroups confined to particular island groups of Remote Oceania.

    There are two prominent exceptions to this prevalence of geographically compact major
subgroups. Each of the Polynesian and Nuclear Micronesian groups is spread over a number
of far-flung archipelagos. The many innovations defining the Polynesian subgroup indicate a
long pause, probably on the order of 1,000 years, in a compact area before dispersal 
(Clark 1979, Pawley 1996a). From the internal subgrouping of Polynesian one can deduce that this
'homeland' was in the Tonga-Samoa area (Green 1966, 1981). Evidence for a period of
common development uniting the Polynesian subgroup with the Fijian languages and Rotuman
(Geraghty 1983, 1986, Pawley 1996a) is consistent with this view, as is the archaeological
evidence for the Fiji-West Polynesia region (Green 1981, Kirch & Green 1987). The internal
structure of the Nuclear Micronesian subgroup, as defined by Bender (1971) and Jackson (1983), 
suggests an initial dispersal centre somewhere in the eastern half of Micronesia.


3.3.2 Lexical reconstructions

   A number of cognate sets yield lexical reconstructions that tell something about early
Austronesian settlement patterns. These are treated here under the headings: (a) kinds of
buildings, (b) house site and main structural components of house, (c) other structures associated
with buildings or settlements and (d) spatial organisation of settlements. We will focus on
those etyma that are definitely or possibly attributable to Proto Oceanic, noting in passing
others that have considerable antiquity but cannot be reconstructed for Proto Oceanic.


3.3.3 Kinds of buildings

   Blust (1987) compared four widely distributed cognate sets whose members generally
name types of domestic buildings. He attributed the reconstruction _*Rumaq_ 'dwelling house'
to both PAn and PMP but could reconstruct the terms _*balay_, _*kamaliR_ and _*lepaw_ only as
far back as PMP, tentatively attributing to them the respective senses of 'public building',
'men's house' and 'granary'. His formal reconstructions are secure but the semantic
reconstructions for the last three forms are somewhat problematic. _*lepaw_ is not known to
have Oceanic reflexes. The other three terms are all reflected in a number of Oceanic
subgroups and therefore must be attributed to POc. Let us briefly review the lexical
reconstructions and supporting data.

   The central sense of PAn, PMP and POc _*Rumaq_ is uncontroversial: in contemporary
Austronesian languages this form is widely reflected in the meaning 'house, dwelling', including
the main dwelling house of a family or larger kin-group. In Oceania, reflexes having this
meaning are found in all major groups except Central Pacific. The question remains whether
_*Rumaq_ had other, secondary senses. Fox (1993) notes that "among Austronesian populations
[reflexes of _*Rumaq_ are] often given a metaphoric sense to define an associated social group
claiming some kind of common derivation or ritual unity …". Blust (1980a) reconstructed
PMP _*Rumaq_ 'lineage, descent group'. This and associated reconstructions sparked off a
lively discussion about early Austronesian social organisation which need not concern us here
but could prove important in the interpretation of Lapita society. Suffice to say the present
day evidence for such a figurative use of _*Rumaq_ appears to be centred in Indonesia and
lacking in Oceania.

   Blust (1987) glosses PMP _*balay_ as 'public building'. However, Waterson (1993: 222)
observes that 'public buildings' traditionally are absent in many Southeast Asian societies.
Her architectural survey of Island Southeast Asia leads her to say (1993: 222-223) that
reflexes of PMP _*balay_ encompass architectural forms with two predominant meanings,
'unwalled building' and 'a meeting hall'. (It is not strictly accurate to speak of just two
predominant meanings because, in the Philippines, _*balay_ reflexes have generally usurped
_*Rumaq_ as the ordinary term for the main domestic building.)

   Our view is that the primary sense of PMP _*balay_ (and its POc continuation _*pale_) was
probably as a generic for open-sided buildings, whether crudely or well built, whether used
for private or public use and whether sited in the main settlement or elsewhere. This semantic
reconstruction has two virtues. First, it is consistent with the widely distributed reflexes of
_*balay_ (often occurring with modifiers) that refer to kinds of buildings with sides open or
partly open (e.g. yam sheds, garden shelters, canoe houses, shrines or god houses, public
buildings) without commitment to any one function or type. Second, it provides a social
motivation for the semantic shift to 'house, main domestic dwelling' that has occurred
independently in a number of branches of Malayo-Polynesian -namely, that _*balay_ named a
type of building of lower prestige than _*Rumaq_, and, as such, _*balay_ was an appropriately
modest or humorous term to call one's own house. In some cases this secondary sense
became the primary one.

PMP *kamaliR 'men's house' (Blust 1987); 'granary shed' (Tryon 1995)

   As was noted earlier, Fox (1993: 12) suggests that the institution of a men's club house
was not part of PMP culture but was borrowed by early Oceanic speakers from non-AN-speaking
peoples of Melanesia and the term _*kamali(R)_ was applied to this institution. Fox
prefers to follow Tryon's (1995) gloss of 'granary, shed' for PMP _*kamaliR_, noting that the
meaning 'storehouse for grain' is strongly attested only in the Philippines. How it came to
function as a place for men to congregate can at present only be a source of speculation.
Unlike PMP speakers, the POc speech community did not cultivate grain crops and it is
possible that in POc some communal social function associated with the building called
_*kamali(R)_ became central.

   Blust (1987: 97, 101) associates the meaning 'granary' with another PMP term, _*lepaw_.
Only one WMP and one CMP witness among the seven that he cites for this cognate set
exhibit reflexes of _*lepaw_ with the meaning 'storehouse for grain'. Why then does Blust
favour it? The main reason is his judgment that this reconstruction makes the best sense of
the overall data, i.e. of the range and distribution of meanings in the several cognate sets
whose members typically denote some sort of domestic building. In particular, there are
much stronger candidates than _*lepaw_ for the meaning 'dwelling house' (namely, _*Rumaq_
and _*balay_) but not for the meaning 'granary'. But in our view PMP _*kamaliR_ has at least as
strong a claim as _*lepaw_ to be glossed 'granary'. In any case, the range of meanings exhibited
by reflexes of _*lepaw_ in Blust's list is not confined to 'house' and 'granary', but also includes
'hut or building other than a longhouse', 'back verandah or kitchen', 'booth or shop'. If we go
beyond Blust's data we may note also Ilokano _lapaw_ 'hut, shanty, not necessarily having
walls, used e.g. as a temporary shelter or a poor family's dwelling', Lahanan _lepau_ 'farmhouse',
Kenyah _lepau_ 'field hut', Kayan _lepo_ 'single family farmhouse'. Our preference is to leave
the gloss of PMP _*lepaw_ uncertain while agreeing with Fox (1993: 11) that it might well have
been used for an 'alternative dwelling', a lesser kind of house or shack that could be used for
a variety of purposes -not only as a makeshift house but as a lodge for hunting, gardening,
or as a store house.

3.3.4 House site and main structural components of house

    In Indonesia and western Melanesia, contemporary dwelling houses are often raised on
piles, but as one moves east, and especially in Remote Oceania, dwellings are usually constructed
on the ground, often on flat mounds of earth raised some 40 cm to 150 cm. In the archaeological
record for Oceania, houses on piles (often over water) are known or inferred for Early Far
Western Lapita sites (the Mussau and Arawe Groups) and Western Lapita sites (Kreslo,
Nissan, Buka). In contrast, in the Reef Islands of Remote Oceania, Lapita houses have sand
floors with debris up against the walls and features within the ground floor are known. New
Caledonian Lapita buildings also have sand floors.

   The following cognate set indicates that POc speakers built dwellings raised on piles.
Although so far attested only in languages of NW Melanesia, the witnesses are widely
dispersed and belong to two distinct high-order (probably first order) subgroups of Oceanic
(Ross 1988), so that the POc reconstruction looks secure.

<

  PT:  Duau               gabule-
  PT:  Sinaugoro          gabule-

_*gabʷari-_ evidently took inalienable possessive marking, with 3rd person singular suffix
marking it as an integral part of a larger entity, namely, the house.

<
PEOc *apu 'mound for house site, platform of earth on which a house is built'
  SES: Gela          avu           'the site of a house'

  Fij: Wayan         avu           'house site, mound (consisting mainly of earth but sometimes also coral rubble), faced with stones, on which a dwelling house is built; functions of mound are drainage and status'
  Fij: Bauan         yavu          'house site, a mound, faced with stones, on which a main dwelling house is built'
  Pn:  Rapanui       ahu           'large platform of stones with religious functions'
  Pn:  Tahitian      ahu           'platform of stones, often stepped, with religious functions; pile up stones, put up wall of a marae'

  Pn:  Maori         ahu           'platform of stones'
>

   It is probably significant that this cognate set is restricted to the Southeast Solomons, Fiji
and Polynesia. The shift to solely ground-level houses seems to have taken place within
Remote Oceania, but perhaps began in the Southeast Solomons. There, and in Fiji and much
of Polynesia, houses are built on mounds or platforms of earth or coral rubble, faced with
stones. The height of the mound at times correlates with status: chiefs in Fiji have higher
mounds (but not in Samoa; see Davidson 1969). In Eastern Polynesia the meaning of _*apu_
changed. In several regions the term was applied to (often very elaborate) sacred platforms,
on which offerings and sacrifices to the gods were presented.

_*kataman_ probably referred to an entrance with its wooden framework. From ethnographic
evidence we infer that true doors were not used: when entrances were to be closed they were
probably blocked off by a barricade.

   Dutton (1994) has reviewed in detail cognate sets referring to sago palms (PMP _*Rambia_
or _*rumbia_) and their uses. Ethnographic descriptions show that, where available, the leaves
of sago palms (esp. Metroxylon spp.) are preferred by Austronesian speakers as roofing
materials, several leaves being sewn together before being lashed to the ridge-pole and stringers.
However, we suggest that 'thatch of sago palm leaves' is too narrow a gloss for PMP _*qatep_
and POc _*qatop_. Leaves of other palms (e.g. coconut, nipa) and grass are also widely used as
thatch. The more general gloss 'thatch, roof' allows for variation in roofing materials.

   A second POc term for thatch is reconstructable, namely _*rau(n)_, whose primary sense
was 'leaf, leaves, foliage'.

   The Papuan Tip (Bwaidoga, Misima) forms point to POc _*pou_, other forms to _*bou_. No

_*turus_ (and their POc reflexes) and of POc _*bou_ are unclear. Reflexe of _*turus_ most often
refer to a main weight-bearing post, supporting either the top plates or ridge-pole. Reflexes of
POc _*bou_, except in Central Pacific, usually refer to a main bearer supporting the raised
floor or roof timbers.

   The next term, POc _*soka(r)_, evidently referred to any sort of bracing timber in a house or
boat.

3.3.5 Other structures associated with buildings

   Under this heading we include terms for partitions, shelves, steps, and so on.

  NNG: Hote          lok      '(garden) fence; wall of house'
  Mic: Kiribati      roki     'screen (of mats +); curtain; bathroom; closed with screen' (possibly borrowed from Polynesian)
  Fij: Rotuman       loki     'the end of the interior of a house'

  cf. also:
  SES: Gela          voki     'room, partition in a house'
>

The meaning of _*logi_ is not entirely clear. The weight of the ethnographic and linguistic
evidence suggests that it probably referred to an inner room or partition containing a bed or
sleeping platform screened off from the outer and more public area of a house. In contemporary
societies the inner room is generally used as a bedroom for husband and wife and for storing
valuables. However, it is conceivable that the POc term did have a more generalised meaning
and could be applied to any partitioned area, whether house or garden (see also Ch. 5, § 12).

The Nauna, Loniu and Lau forms point to POc _*paRa_, the Fijian reflex to _*para_, while other
Oceanic forms cited here are compatible with either reconstruction. [6]

[6] Blust (ACD) has proposed POc _*pala_ or _*paRa_ 'platform, firewood shelf above the hearth' and, under

The Polynesian forms reflect PPn glottal stop rather than expected _*k_, a development found
in several other words (Geraghty 1983, 1986).

    As metal tools were almost certainly unknown to the early Austronesians, POc _*pako_ and
its PMP source presumably referred to wooden pegs or pins. In many languages the reflex of
this term was later applied to iron nails. Terms for stone woodworking tools can be reconstructed
for PAn and later interstages (see Ch. 4, §4.1), indicating a woodworking tradition continuing
from PAn times.


3.3.6 Other structures associated with settlements


   A general term for fireplace or hearth is reconstructable for PMP and continued in POco
We cannot tell from linguistic evidence whether or not fireplaces for cooking were built
inside main dwelling houses.

The PT and SES forms in the above set are cognate on the assumption that metathesis
occurred in one set or the other. In many Oceanic languages a reflex of _*lua(ŋ)_ is the general
term for any sort of hole, including pits used for cooking or for storing breadfruit and certain
other crops. POc _*giRu_ or _*guRi_ may have referred to deep pits dug for graves or wells.

3.3.7 Settlement patterns

   Some contemporary Oceanic societies live in villages of up to several hundred people in
size; others live in scattered hamlets or homesteads containing one or two extended families.
No POc term specifically meaning 'village' or 'nucleated settlement' can be reconstructed

nucleated settlement originally meant something else. This point is illustrated by the following
four cognate sets.

   Although reflexes of PMP _*banua_ carry the meaning 'village' in a number of languages
belonging to different high-order subgroups (or at least are given this gloss in the dictionaries)
a host of other evidence, summarised in Blust (1987: 94-95, 99-100) suggests that PMP
_*banua_ and its reflex in POc referred primarily to an inhabited territory; not only to the land
but to the human population and dwellings and all plant and animal life and other elements
that contribute to the maintenance of the human community-a complex concept with no
simple equivalent in European languages (but compare the many senses of 'land' and 'country').
Indeed, the single word glosses that bilingual dictionaries give for reflexes of _*banua_ should
generally be regarded not as accurate descriptions of their meaning in the source language,
but as shorthand translations designed to fit the categories of the target language.

   The term _*pera_ is well-attested in both major subgroups of Southeast Solomonic (i.e.
Cristobal-Malaitan and Guadalcanal-Gelic) but has only one secure external cognate, in
Manam. The range of meanings or glosses associated with this cognate set makes it impossible
to make a firm semantic reconstruction either for POc or for Proto Southeast Solomonic. Our
best guess is that *pera referred to some sort of settlement or space associated with this.

   For POc _*malaqai_, Milke (1968) proposed the gloss 'village'. However, that gloss applies
only to its few Western Oceanic reflexes. PPn _*malaʔe_ clearly denoted an open space in the
centre of a settlement, used for communal activities.

<
POc *m(a,e)laqai '(?) open space in a settlement'
 NNG: Yabem           melaʔ           'village'

 Pn:  Maori           marae           'enclosed space before house, courtyard'
>

   Rotuman _maraʔe_ 'open space in centre of village' is indicated to be a loan from Polynesian
by the presence of _r_ and glottal stop for expected _l_ and zero. Kiribati _marae_ 'empty space,
clear place, public place, sports ground' is probably borrowed from Polynesian.

   Another POc term whose reflexes in a few daughter languages now mean 'village' is
_*mwalala_. Once again, however, the balance of the evidence suggests that it did not have this
meaning in POco

   Various POc terms for garden land and for land not under cultivation can be reconstructed
(see Ch. 5, §3). Here we cite only one, POc _*qutan_ 'bushland, hinterland, away from village
and gardens close to village' which goes back to PAn _*quCan_ 'fallow land' (Blust 1989);
'scrubland, bush' (ACD).



3.4 On variation and change in early Oceanic architectural styles and settlement patterns

   Contact with Papuan (non-Austronesian) speaking communities may have led to local
variation and change in the architectural forms and settlement patterns of Proto Oceanic
speakers or their immediate descendants. Earlier we touched on the possibility that the concept
of a 'men's clubhouse', associated with POc _*kamali(R)_, was borrowed from Papuan speakers.
The same applies to the concept of an oven made with heated stones, POc _*qumun_ 
(Chowning 1991, Lichtenberk 1994). Such ovens appear to have a much greater antiquity in Near
Oceania and Australia than in Southeast Asia (Allen, Gosden & White 1989: 550-551;
Berbetti & Allen 1972, Horton 1994).[8]

[8] Note that although ovens are very ancient in Australia, stones do not appear to have been used in them.

                                                 Architecturalforms and settlement patterns                   65


   The ethnographic and linguistic evidence point to a shift from dwelling houses built on
piles in the Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea area to houses built on the ground in the
Solomons and Remote Oceania. It is significant that the term _*apu_ 'mound, mound made for
a house site' appears to be confined to languages of the Southeast Solomons and Remote
Oceania. Conversely, it is not surprising that reflexes of POc _*gabʷari-_ 'area underneath a
house' are confined to Western Oceanic.

   In interstages postdating the break-up of POc a number of changes can be discerned in
terms for houses and their parts. For example, POc _*bou_ probably meant 'main bearer or
cross beam', but its Fijian reflexes now mean 'the tall or centre posts of a house' while in PPn
this term became the generic name for 'post', while POc _*turu(s)_ '(main) post' was lost. The
POc word for 'entrance, doorway', _*katama_, is replaced in PPn by _*faʔitoka_. In Central
Pacific, or at least in the eastern region of the Central Pacific dialect chain (ancestral to
Polynesian and some Eastern Fijian dialects), _*pale_ replaced _*Rumaq_ as the ordinary term
for a dwelling house. Further study is needed to see whether any of these linguistic changes
can be correlated with transformations in house forms in the eastern Fiji-Polynesian area.



3.5. Conclusion

   Where comparable evidence is available, the testimonies of archaeology, ethnology and
comparative linguistics are generally consistent regarding the architecture and settlement
patterns of the Austronesian speakers who colonised the SW Pacific in the late 2nd millennium
BC. Various POc terms for types of buildings and parts of a dwelling house and for associated
artefacts and activities have been reconstructed, including some elements that can be associated
with Austronesian as opposed to non-Austronesian speaking societies. The more completely
excavated Lapita sites show some of these elements and nothing inconsistent. At least some
dwellings in Far Western Lapita sites were of the raised platform type. However, as one
moves east into the Solomons and beyond, they more often sat on the ground, as is still the
case ethnographically. It should perhaps be emphasised that the equation of Lapita sites with
Austronesian languages does not rest solely on the evidence concerning house forms and
settlements. This equation is supported by a wide range of correspondences in many cultural
domains of which we have canvassed only one in detail. It is also in keeping with the
geographic distribution of these languages and sites. In our view the conjunction of the two
data sets opens up possibilities that are well worth exploring further. When both are employed
they allow the construction of a far more rounded picture of a period of considerable foment
in Pacific colonisation than either does alone.


4 Household artefacts

4.1 Introduction

   The artefacts considered here are mainly household items, used in the gathering and
storage of food, in the construction and maintenance of dwellings and gardens, and those
used for personal adornment. Some of the items--earthenware pots, stone adzes and axes,
bone needles, bone and shell ornaments, and stone bark-cloth beaters -have provided
archaeologists with data that permit dating. Those made of perishable materials-such as leaf
baskets, string bags, mats and bamboo knives -seldom leave any trace in the archaeological
record. For these we are dependent on linguistic reconstruction interpreted in the light of
current ethnographic practice.[1]

   Artefacts are organised under the following headings: (1) containers; (2) mats and cordage;
(3) tools; (4) items of body decoration and clothing, and (5) instruments of communication
and music. Terms for relevant processes are included. Thus, within the section on mats and
cordage we have included terms for weaving, making thread, sewing, and for needle and
twine. Often the term for a tool is derived from the verb denoting the activity of using it.


[1] We are indebted to Ann Chowning both for the many references taken from her 1991 paper
'Proto Oceanic culture: the evidence from Melanesia', and for her more recent comments and
additions to the data offered during the preparation of this chapter.


4.2 Containers

4.2.1 Pottery containers

   Pottery is one of the more distinctive features of the Lapita culture, here held to coincide
with and thus be an integral marker of the early dispersal of Proto Oceanic.[2] Pottery manufacture
in Oceania is geographically discontinuous. By no means all Oceanic speakers make pottery.
Obviously, pottery can only be made where suitable clay is available, but its availability is no
guarantee that pottery will be manufactured. Nor is its absence from the immediate locality a
guarantee that pottery will not be made: the Gumawana speakers of the Amphlett group
transport their clay some distance by sea from Fergusson Island. As a result of this discontinuity,
pots were traditionally important trade items. A linguistic spin-off of this trade is that words
for pots are not infrequently loan words, especially in the languages of the people who are not
potters.

[2] For a fuller account of POc pottery manufacture, see Ross (1996c).

68 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


   Ross (1996c:69) writes that most Oceanic languages have quite a simple pot terminology
with three or four main terms.

|   There is generally a term for cooking pot, which often also doubles as the term for pottery in
|   general … Secondly, there is a term for water pot or water jar. Thirdly, there is a term for a
|   bowl or dish with a variety of functions, and finally a term for a frying dish or frying pan (in
|   some societies the object itself is actually the large sherd of a broken pot).

    There is fair agreement across Oceanic languages about the structure of the
terminology -Ross provides evidence from NNG, PT, Admiralties and Fijian languages which
all have terms (not necessarily cognate) for pot (generic), cooking pot, water jar, bowl/dish
and frying pan (see Figure 4) - and we have PMP reconstructions in support of corresponding
POc terms. However, our cognate sets are disappointingly small. Of our reconstructions, the
cooking pot/generic term is the most soundly based.

4.2.1.2 Waterjar

    The best candidate for 'water jar' is POc _*kalala(ŋ)_, reconstructed on the basis of Proto
WMP _*kalalaŋ_ 'narrow-necked water jar' (Tagalog _kalalaŋ_ 'narrow-necked water jug'; Blust
 1980b). However, only one Oceanic reflex, in the PT language Iduna, has been found: _kalala_
'cooking pot made in Wedau'. Even this reflex is problematic, since POc _*l_ is reflected as
Iduna _n_ in directly inherited items, and we must therefore assume that the item has been
borrowed, as its gloss would imply.

    Another possible, PNGOc, term for water jar is _*bʷad(r)i_, for which the evidence is given
below. All reflexes except one are from the north coast of New Guinea, and mean 'pot
(generic), cooking pot', where they have ousted reflexes of POc _*kuron_ in this role, but there
is evidence that this is the result of post-Proto Oceanic genericisation. The characteristic
Oceanic cooking pot and water jar are quite similar in form, differing only in the narrowness
of the neck of the water jar, so that genericisation of the water jar term is quite likely. The
facts that the one non-north coast term, from Misima, means 'water pot' and that there are
indications (in Mindiri and Bilibil) that reflexes of _*bʷad(r)i_ also mean 'water pot' suggest
that this was its original meaning.

  NNG: Manam          boadi             'pot, cooking vessel'
  NNG: Kaiep          biar              'generic name for pots'
  NNG: Kairiru        buar̃              'cooking pot'

The Motu and Lala items are either borrowed or simply bear a chance resemblance to this set.

4.2. 1.3 Frying pan


  The best candidate for 'frying pan', POc _*palaŋa_, has been noted by Blust (ACD). Again,
Oceanic reflexes are not plentiful, but here there can hardly be any doubt that they reflect the
PMP term.

<
PMP *balaŋa 'shallow earthenware cooking pot or pan' (ACD)

  NNG: Gedaged  palaŋ            'potsherd, used to render fat and to cook oil; frying pan, shallow roaster'
>


4.2. 1.4 Large cooking pot


   One other Proto Oceanic term for a type of pot is reconstructable, namely _*bʷaŋa_. This
seems to have referred to a large pot, perhaps a communal cooking pot:

<
PMP *báŋaq 'pot, cooking vessel'
POc *bʷaŋa 'k.o. large pot'
PNGOc  *|(kuron) bʷaŋa| 'communal cooking pot'
  NNG: Adzera      |(gur) baŋa|     'common cooking pot for meat' (_gur_ 'clay pot')
  PT:  Misima      |(ulun) bʷana|   'cooking pot about 60 cm high, used as a community cooking pot' (_ulun_ 'clay pot')
>


4.2. 1.5 Dish


   We have been unable to reconstruct a POc term for a bowl or dish. Indeed, the only term
we have found reflected over quite a large area is PPT _*na(q)u(q)_. The meanings of its
reflexes indicate that it meant 'dish'. In a number of PT languages it has come to mean
'cooking pot', but this is not surprising if it is recognised that in south-east (but not central)
Papua, the typical Oceanic cooking pot with its restricted spherical form has been frequently
replaced by pots with an unrestricted, dish-like form. In Gumawana, an important pot-making
centre in the Amphletts, no, reflecting _*na(q)u(q)_, has been genericised to mean 'pot' and is
the first element in a number of pot types listed in Olsen's dictionary: _nobadala_, _nogaiga_,
_nokaokao_, _nokunu_, _nopaeva_, _nosipoma_. All of these are apparently dish-like in form. Some
reflexes of _*naquq_ are listed below. The crucial reflexes for determining the meaning of
_*na(q)u(q)_ are those from central Papua-Hula, Motu and Kuni - where Oceanic restricted
pot forms remain the norm, and _naɣu_/_nau_ clearly refers only to dishes.

<
PPT *na(q)u(q) 'clay dish'
  PT:  Gumawana       no               'clay pot'
  PT:  Molima         nau(kai)         'wooden dish' (_kai_ 'wood')
  PT:  Iduna          nauʔa            'dish, bowl, plate'
  PT:  Are            nau              'cooking pot'
  PT:  Muyuw          no(kay)          'large wooden dish' (_kay_ 'wood')
  PT:  Sudest         noɣa             '(wooden) dish'
  PT:  Hula           naɣu             'clay plate used by Motu and Mailu people'
  PT:  Motu           nau              'shallow open dish for serving'
  PT:  Kuni           nau
>

Only the Hula form reflects a possible medial _*-q-_. Since Hula sometimes adds a nonetymological 
_-y-_ between vowels, _*-q-_ cannot be reconstructed with certainty. Final _*-q_ is
reflected in Iduna and Sudest, but not in Gumawana, Molima or Are, where a reflex would
also be expected. These uncertainties raise the possibility that this term is cognate with the
forms attributed to POc _*napu_ 'steam (?), boil (7)' (Ch. 6, §3.4).

                                                                        Household artefacts   71


4.2.1.6 Lid

   Both cooking pots and narrow-necked water jars may have utilised lids. In addition to
those terms glossed 'plug, stopper', which are included with coconut or bamboo water carriers,
we have terms referring rather to 'lid' or 'cover':

<
PMP *tub-tub 'close, cover' (Mills 1981)
POc *tupi 'cover (s.t.)' (Blust 1978b)
POc *tutup 'cover' (Lichtenberk 1994)
  Adm: Lou                tup-tup             'cover up'
  Adm: Loniu              tu-tuh              'cover'
  Fij: Bauan              tuvi                'cover, conceal'
>

<
PMP *tub-an 'lid, cover' (Mills 1981, glossed as a verb)
POc *tup-a((n,ŋ)) 'lid, cover'
  Adm: Loniu             tu-tuha             'cover, lid, leaf used as lid'
  NNG: Tumleo            cup                 'lid'
>

Note that _*tup-a(n,ŋ)_ is a nominalised form derived from _*[tu]tup_, _*tupi_ (see discussion of
nominalisations in Chapter 2, §3.2.1).


4.2.1.7 Tools in pot manufacture

   Oceanic pots were typically made using the paddle-and-anvil technique, whereby a smooth
stone (the 'anvil') is held against the inside of the pot while the outside is beaten with a flat
piece of wood (the 'paddle'). Almost every Oceanic pot-making group for which we have
data refers to the anvil simply as the 'stone', for which the POc word was _*patu_ (Andra _pat_,
Mindiri _pot_, Uruava _patu_, Bauan Fijian _vatu_ are all reflexes used both in the general sense of
'stone' and in the specialised sense of 'anvil'). Ross (1996c) has reconstructed _*tapi_ 'paddle
for beating clay into shape' with the proviso that the apparent reflexes may be independently
derived instrumental nominalisations of the PMP verb _*tapik_ 'slap, pat lightly' (Blust 1988).

4.2.2 Wooden or coconut-shell containers

4.2.2.1 Wooden bowl

  The most important non-ceramic vessel in immediate pre-contact times was the wooden
bowl. In parts of Papua New Guinea, finely-wrought bowls were an important trade item.
(Among the most famous are bowls from the Tami Islands off the Huon Peninsula and the
Trobriand Islands). The generic term for a wooden bowl was probably POc _*tabiRa_:

Figure 5: POc _*tabiRa_ 'wooden bowl'

This last set could be taken to reflect a POc _**tabili_, but their formal and semantic similarity
to reflexes of _*tabiRa_ suggests that this inference is not justified. Rather, they are probably
descended from an etymon which originated somewhere in the Solomons in the borrowing of
a reflex of _*tabiRa_ denoting a trade item, apparently a wooden dish used for mashing and/or
crushing.

[3] The pair are strikingly parallel to POc _*upi_/_*ipu_ 'blow', and it is possible that both

   An additional reconstruction, POc _*asu_ (V) 'scoop or ladle out' ; (N) 'ladle, bailer', from
PMP _*aŋsu_ 'scoop or bail out' is included in Chapter 7, §7.4.

   The following set, from Ross (1996a), is listed because explanation is needed for the fact
that it is apparently reflected only in Yapese and NNG languages: is it a retention or a
borrowing? (Takia _-ae-_, Bilibil, Megiar _-ai-_ reflect _*-a-_ which has undergone umlaut because
of a lost final _*-i_.)

so, all that can be inferred is a second gloss for this reconstructed form (ACD).

4.2.2. 4 Stopper

up the mouth of a water bottle:

<

  SES: Gela                do-doŋa-na        'fitted tight as a cork'

This is a nominalisation of the verb below (cf. Ch. 2, §3.2.1):

<

4.2.2.5 Lime pot

   There is one other kind of container associated with Melanesians other than the inhabitants
of Vanuatu and Fiji, and that is the lime pot of betel-nut users. The lime container is usually a
gourd, coconut shell or small tightly-woven basket. A lime spatula of bone or wood, sometimes
highly decorated, rests in the gourd and is used to convey lime to the mouth. We have a
reconstruction for the spatula, POc _*d(r)amu_, but no specific term for the lime pot. In a
number of word lists the term for lime (often from POc _*qapu(R)_) also can refer to the pot.
We have reconstructed a PEOc term for a gourd, _*tapaya_ 'gourd, water bottle', but there are
no cognates from SES, which is the only area of eastern Oceanic where betel is chewed, and
we lack any Western Oceanic reconstruction.

                                                                    Household artefacts       77


4.2.2. 6 Lime spatula

  SES: Arosi              damu              'chew betel nut'
>

The final _-i_ of Mussau _ra-ramuti_ suggests that this reflects a transitive verb _*d(r)amut-i-_,
perhaps 'add lime to a chew of betel nut'.

4.2.3 Woven containers

    Usable baskets or trays can be improvised in a few minutes from the wealth of leaves and
fibres generally within easy reach. Baskets used today vary greatly in size, shape and function.
They range from the large trays used at feasts to tiny purses carried within string bags.
Individual communities have evolved their own shapes, styles and traditions of use. Some
styles may be so individual or striking that they come to be representative of a particular
region or community. Baskets may be with or without handles; carried over the shoulder,
from the head or hand or under the arm; used by men only or women only; strictly utilitarian
or finely decorated, multi-purpose or highly specific in their use. Different styles may be
distinguished by name.

   Perhaps surprisingly, in view of the widespread use of bags and baskets and the large
number of terms collected, it has proved difficult to locate clear cognate sets with broad
distribution. Any proliferation of types and styles would require new terms or reinterpretation
of old terms. The likelihood of borrowing is also high.

Arosi _-s-_ from _*-t-_ is conditioned by a following _*-u_, supporting its reconstruction rather than
that of _*-0_. Carolinian _xɔ̄t_ and some other Micronesian cognates are problematic, since their
_-t_ reflects POc _*s_ or _*j_ rather than _*t_.

This form is unlikely to be of POc ancestry, as medial _*-e-_ is rare in POc. It may well have an
association with one of the two _*k_-initial forms above.

Figure 9: Reconstructions (non-specific) include: POc _*katu(m,ŋ)_ 'basket', POc _*laka_
'basket ', POc _*tab(w)e_ 'basket, probably small', POc _*taŋa_ 'basket or bag, small, used for
personal effects' (after Koch 1986: 104 and n.d.:59)

   Biggs (1993) lists two further terms for PPn, *taapola 'basket plaited from a single coconut
frond' (from POc _*bola_ 'coconut leaves woven together for any purpose'. See under §3.1Mats); and _*qora_ 'fishing basket'.

   Bags, typically of twine made from fibres rolled together on the thigh and then knotted
into a mesh, are more likely to be used for carrying than for storage. They are a prominent
item among western Oceanic peoples, the women carrying them slung from a band round the
head, and the men generally over one shoulder. On the New Guinea mainland, they are the
means by which a woman carries a baby. The widespread modern term for these bags is
bilum, a Tok Pis in term apparently from Tolai, but without cognates outside MM . The
present distribution pattern of use would seem to reflect a possible Papuan origin for the net
bag. In east New Britain (Tolai and Baining at least) heavy loads are carried in a coconut leaf
basket suspended from the forehead by a tumpline (Ann Chowning, pers.comm.). The following
reconstruction may have been a general term for a small plaited or woven container which
has come to refer to a net bag in parts of western Oceania.

is used for both tree and the article typically made from it. Thus we have POc _*kiRe_ 'coastal
pandanus: mat made from its leaves', and PWOc _*moke_ 'pandanus species, used to make
capes and mats' (see Plants, vol. 3). Mats on which food is placed will usually be made from
coconut leaf. Where strength and endurance are important, as in canoe sails, pandanus is the
preferred leaf, and the items are sewn rather than woven. Sleeping mats and house walls may
be of either leaf. On the use of reflexes of *qebal for sails, see Chapter 7, §5.1.

  It is possible that the two NCV reflexes in the above set are borrowings from Polynesia
(Ross Clark pers.comm.). If so, this reduces the reconstruction from PEOc to PCP.

  Two further terms have been reconstructed for PPn only: _*fala_ 'plaited pandanus mat',
and _*faaliki_ 'cover floor with mats or grass; floor covering', both from Biggs (1993).



4.3. 1. 1 Weaving, plaiting

   The distinction between weaving and plaiting is not clear even in English, although as a
broad principle, weaving produces a fabric and plaiting a braid. Sometimes plaiting is used in
descriptive accounts as a general term for all forms of mat and basket making. There are
some processes in mat making where the edges of the mat are finished with a kind of
braiding. Any distinction between the terms in word lists is consequently not considered
significant, unless clarified by context. Where plaiting is used in reconstructions here, it is to
be taken as an inclusive term for all kinds of mat and basket manufacture (but excluding
loom weaving).

   Ann Chowning (pers.comm.) has offered an additional sense to POc _*raraŋ_, _*raraŋ-i-_
(from PAn _*da(n)daŋ_), which Lichtenberk glosses as 'warm oneself by fire'; 'warm up,
reheat (esp. food)' (see Chapter 6, §3.5, for the full cognate set). She contributes cognates
from Molima, Kove and Nakanai which all refer to the preparation of pandanus leaves for
mat making by softening them over a fire, and accord closely with the gloss of the single
Polynesian cognate.

4.3.2 Cord, twine

   The simplest material for tying would have been lengths of vine or rattan, or strips of
suitable bark, such as hibiscus. (pOc *waRoc 'vine, creeper, rope, string'; POc _*quwe_ 'rattan'
(see Plants, vol. 3)). A strong light twine could be made by rolling fibres together on the thigh.
The strongest cords and ropes are made by twisting or plaiting various kinds of fibres or
rolled thread, principally coconut fibre or hibiscus bark.

'pierce, sew (mats)' and _*(su)suRi_ 'bone (needle); sew' were also used for sewing, but this
was not their primary meaning.

    In the following set there may be some blending of meaning between two formally close
terms, POc _*s(u,i)ri_ 'pierce, poke' (Ch. 9, §4.1) and POc _*suRi_ 'bone', because needles were
at times made from bones (of bird or flying fox or occasionally pig).

needle, in addition to a more general meaning.

4.4 Tools

4.4.1 Cutting implements

4.4.1.1 Axe, adze

   Oliver (1989:88) identifies axe heads as having cutting ends bevelled on both sides, adzes
as having cutting ends bevelled on one side only, and axe-adzes which are bevelled so as to be
used either way. They are, of course, hafted differently on to their handle, the axe head lying
along the same plane while the adze head is set at right angles to the handle. Axes would
have been used primarily in tree-felling; adzes for such activities as the hollowing out and
shaping of canoes, or the extraction of pith from sago palms. Either implement could have
been utilised in the shaping of timber for the construction of houses, fenceposts etc. Although
the preferred material for an adze blade was presumably basalt, archaeological sites in Island
Oceania contain numbers of axes and particularly adzes, made of shell, mostly of Tridacna,
the giant clam (Oliver 1989: 89). On coral atolls, shell often has by necessity to substitute for
stone.

[5]   Takia -l- is the lenis reflex of POc *-t-.

The following are possibly related to the set above but all reflect an extra _*i_ (Loniu and
Tawala reflect a possible POc _*mʷati_, the NNG items a putative _*(m,mʷ)aita_). It is possible that
this _*i_ reflects the incorporation into _*(m,mʷ)ata_ of the generic possessive preposition _*qi_,
which would frequently have occurred immediately after it (e.g. POc _**(m,mʷ)ata-qi kiRam_
'axe blade') and is reflected in Mota matai above.

   The existence of axe and adze heads with characteristic shaping to accommodate a handle,
together with reconstruction of a term clearly designating 'handle of adze or axe' indicates
that POc speakers were familiar with a stone head hafted to a wooden handle. This would
have been by means of gum adhesives and cordage, much as described by latter day
ethnographers (e.g. Oliver 1974: 135-137 for Tahiti).

With regard to the reconstruction of _*(p,pʷ)_, see Chapter 2, §2.1. Western Oceanic and SES
languages show assimilation of POc _*r_ to _*R_, but we assume that assimilation had not
occurred in POc, since, as Blust points out, Puluwat _r_ reflects POc _*r_, whilst Woleaian _ṣ_
inexplicably reflects POc _*dr_. One of the Arosi reflexes and the Raga, Puluwat and Woleaian
reflexes show haplology.

4.4. 1.2 Knives

   Knives were typically made from bamboo. Shells also provided good cutting edges. Probably
the very best cutting edge would have been a flake of obsidian, used as a razor or for
whatever forms of surgery might have been performed on the human body, and the term for
this was apparently _*koto_ (see below). However, dedicated terms for 'knife', as opposed to
the substances they were made from, are hardly reconstructable in POco The only one we can
be sure of is:

<
PMP *pisaw '(bamboo) knife' [6]
POc *piso '(bamboo) knife'
    Adm:    Mussau             iso                  'cut (meat +)'

    reflexes listed here.


   Although PCP _*sele_ 'knife; cut with a knife' seems to have cognates elsewhere, it is highly
likely that the Lukep, Lihir and Nengone terms were introduced by Fijian or Polynesian
missionaries to apply to western metal knives:

forms are too different to suggest cognation. PEAd _*care_ points back to an otherwise unattested

4.4. 1.3 Flint, obsidian

    Obsidian, glass-hard volcanic stone found on Lou Island (Admiralties), on Fergusson
Island in the D'Entrecasteaux group, at Talasea (Willaumez Peninsula of New Britain) and
Banks Island, Vanuatu, and, from its traces in excavated Lapita sites, a much sought-after
trade item among early Oceanic speakers, serves as a fine cutting edge. POc _*nad(r)i_ is
reconstructable, although in places it refers only to hard stone (with a cutting edge?). _*qa(r,R)iŋ_
is reconstructable only for PWOc. Reflexes of POc *koto refer to a variety of uses of the
material and suggest that its primary meaning was 'obsidian cutting edge':

4.4. 1. 4 Awl

   MUlti-purpose piercing tools may have been carried, fashioned from bone, perhaps a pig's
femur. These were useful for piercing shells, splitting fibres for weaving, splitting areca nuts,
separating coconut meat from its shell and such daily activities. They were probably also used
to pierce earlobes and the nasal septum. Green (1979:39) lists a worked pig-tusk piercing tool
from the Main Reef Islands, circa 1100 B.C. Reconstructions appear primarily verbal, with a
term for the instrument sometimes derivable from the verb. They include  POc _*puru(k)_,
_*puruk-i-_ 'pierce, bore (hole)', POc _*buru_ 'bore a hole, drill'; PWOc _*bʷaR(i,e)_ 'bore (hole)';
and PEOc _*paRo_ 'drill through, pierce, perforate' (see Chapter 9, §4.2, for the cognate sets).

4.4. 1.5 Sharpening and grinding

   There is evidence that all three of the basic methods for shaping stone-flaking (also
called chipping), pecking and grinding-were practised in POc times (Oliver 1989: 144). We
have several reconstructions for actions which include sharpening or grinding, but they may
also refer to grating (foodstuffs), and at times to rasping and filing (wood and shell). Pumice,
widely available in volcanic regions, was typically used for sharpening stone. Although we
can reconstruct terms for the activity, the only reconstruction we have for the implement is
the PCP term for a whetstone.

<
PCP *vuqa(i)ŋa 'whetstone, grindstone'
  Fij: Wayan           vuaiŋō           'pumice stone, pumice; used for scouring coconut-shell cups'
  Pn:  Tongan          fuʔo-fuʔaŋa      'pumice'
  Pn:  Samoan          foaŋa            'grindstone'

  Pn:  Maori           hōaŋa            'sandstone used in grinding stone'
>

From its form it is clear that PCP _*vuqa(i)ŋa_ is a nominalisation. The corresponding verb
occurs in Polynesian languages with somewhat altered meaning (Samoan _foa_ 'break rock or
shell', Hawaiian _hoa_ 'strike with stick or club'). Together with the WOc cognates, Iduna (PT)
_fua-_ 'crush', Motu (PT) _huari_ 'smash, as pottery' and Tolai _puar_ 'break (cup, glass +)' they
point to POc _*pu(q)a(R)_, _*pu(q)aR-i-_ 'break, as s.t. hard, smash'.

Both _*kiri_ and _*giri_ are reconstructable, the latter perhaps a verb from _*N-kiri_; the Polynesian
reflexes are attributable to either.


   The same terms may have also been used to describe the actions of smoothing and
polishing. The Polynesians, in particular, were concerned to produce a fine finish to their
artefacts by rubbing. Beaglehole wrote of the Tahitians, "All their [wood] work however
acquires a certain neatness in the finishing for they polish every thing, even the side of a
canoe or a Post of a house, with Coral sand rubbed on in the outer husk of a Cocoa nut and
rays skin, which makes them very smooth and neat." (quoted in Oliver 1974: 134). The
general term for this may have been POc *quju(r) 'rub, make smooth by rubbing' (see Ch. 9,
§2.3). In at least one language (Woleaian in Micronesia) the term for a file is the same term
as that for stingray (_faiya_ > PAn _*paRis_ 'stingray'), the skin of which serves as a fine
abrasive.


4.5 Bark-cloth, clothing, body decoration

4.5.1 Bark-cloth (_tapa_)

   The material used to make bark-cloth or tapa in the Pacific area is obtained mainly from
various species of trees belonging to the genera Broussonetia, Artocarpus, and Ficus, all of
which belong to the family Moraceae. Wherever _tapa_ was made, the Broussonetia papyrijera
or paper mulberry tree was used for the highest quality cloth. It is not native to the Pacific,
but to eastern Asia, whence migrants carried it to Indonesia and the Pacific. The only other
significant source is the Pipturus species, used for _tapa_ particularly in Hawaii (Kooijman 1972: 1).

96 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross

    Bark-cloth is a significant item in Indonesia and in the eastern Oceanic region, particularly
Polynesia, but also Santa Cruz, New Caledonia and Fiji. However, it does not feature strongly
in the western Oceanic region. Ivens wrote (1918: 186) that although bark-cloth (_tapa_) was
made in Melanesia, it never figured as an article of clothing, and its main use was to form a
kind of shawl in which the baby was slung when carried from the shoulder. Ivens was
probably speaking from a Solomons perspective. Kooijman (1972:446) quotes reports by
Chalmers and Gill (1885) which mention bark-cloth from Collingwood Bay and the Gulf of
Papua (both PT); while in the Northern Province of south-east Papua, for instance, bark-cloth
is a prestigious valuable. In parts of New Britain it was used to bind the heads of young
babies to achieve the desired elongated skull shape (Ann Chowning, pers.comm.). Kooijman
(pp.446-453) points out that the descriptions of the manufacture of New Guinea bark-cloth
and the study of the museum material indicate that, as a rule, this _tapa_ is relatively thick and
stiff and made from Ficus and Artocarpus varieties, rather than from Broussonetia. He
believes that the latter was probably not used for _tapa_ cloth in New Guinea. He records little
mention of bark-cloth use in Micronesia, other than the wearing of _tapa_ ponchos in Ponape.
Yen (1973:83), in his examination of the origins of Oceanic agriculture, describes the cultivation
of paper mulberry, as a pruned shrub for the production of bark for cloth, as ceasing west of
the Melanesia/Polynesia border area.


Figure 12: POc *ike 'tapa beater'

   Although terms can be located in WOc, none are cognate, and no POc term is reconstructable,
apart from terms for the sources of raw material, POc _*(m,mʷ)ase_ 'wild mulberry, paper
mulberry, 'Broussonetia papyrijera' POc _*kuluR_ 'breadfruit, Artocarpus' (from PAn _*kuluR_)
and POc _*nunu(k)_ (from PMP _*nunuk_ 'banyan, Ficus spp.') (see Plants, vol. 3).

  The term _tapa_, now virtually the generic term for bark-cloth, can be reconstructed for
PCP.

<
PCP *taba 'bark'
  Fij: Wayan          taba         'skin, bark'
  Pn:  Tongan         tapa [7]     'edge, rim, border, boundary' (present meaning); 'bark-cloth (not printed or stained)' (old meaning) (Kooijman, p. 301, from Mariner 1827)
  Pn:  Samoan         tapa         'white border of coloured bark-cloth sheet'
  Pn:  Mangareva      tapa         'bark-cloth'
  Pn:  Rarotongan     tapa         'cloth made from inner bark of certain trees'

  SES: Arosi          ʔaba         'wing, limb; leaf (of banana +)'
>

   Note that although the general term for bark-cloth in Tonga is _ŋatu_ and in Samoa is _siapo_,
the term _tapa_ does exist in both places. In Tonga today it refers more generally to 'edge, rim,
border, boundary', and in Samoa it refers to the uncoloured border of the coloured bark-cloth
sheet or _siapo_. Biggs (1993) lists these as apparently unrelated homonyms. Alternatively, if
we assume the original PPn meaning of _*tapa_ to be 'bark-cloth which was not printed or
stained', its more restricted meaning in Samoa is understandable.

[7]   Kooijman quotes from a report by William Mariner, a young Englishman stranded in Tonga from 1806-1810,
    indicating that at that time the term _tapa_ was used as well as the more general term _ŋatu_, the former
    referring to any bark-cloth "not printed or stained" (Mariner 1827, vol. 2, p.206).

                                                                               Household artefacts           97


   A second term in Polynesia, referring both to plant and product, is widespread:

<
PPn *siapo 'paper-mulberry plant (Broussonetia sp.); bark-cloth' (Biggs 1993)
    Pn:     Niuean             hiapo                'paper-mulberry plant, bark-cloth garment'
    Pn:     Tongan             hiapo                'paper-mulberry plant'
    Pn:     E. Futunan         siapo                'bark-cloth'
    Pn:     Samoan             siapo                'bark-cloth from paper mulberry'
    Pn:     Marquesan          hiapo                'young banyan from which tapa is made'
>

    A number of reconstructions have been made at PCP or PPn level, but the similarity of
gloss indicates the likelihood of more subtleties of meaning than we have been able to
identify here. They include: PCP _*ŋatu_ 'old or worn bark-cloth', PCP _*leu-leu_ '(old) tapa
cloth', and PPn _*ŋafi-ŋafi_ 'old mat or bark-cloth' (Biggs 1993).

    The only term reconstructable for the Southeast Solomons is apparently limited to the
island of Malaita.

  We have a reconstruction for the mallet used in beating _tapa_ which goes back as far as
PMP:

    WMP: Uma [8]                  ike                 'tapa-beating mallet' (Kennedy 1934:237)
>

[8]   Kennedy identified terms as 'Toradja' in central Sulawesi. This is now recognised as a group of around a
  dozen related languages. The term ike 'barkcloth beater' exists in at least one of them, Uma. Thanks are due
  to Phil Quick for locating relevant texts.

   Biggs (1993) has PPn reconstructions for the action of beating _tapa_ (_*tutu_), and the board
or anvil on which this was done (_*tutua_). Both terms are derived from PAn _*tuqtuq_ 'hammer,
pound, crush ', POc _*tutuk_ (see Ch. 9, §5.1). It is of interest that the Toradja of central
Sulawesi also have a term _totua_ for the wooden board on which the bark-cloth is beaten
(Kennedy 1934).



4.5.2 Clothing

   Over the region as a whole there is enormous variation in the degree and nature of body
covering in these areas. Chowning (1991: 46) points out that "although ornaments were worn
everywhere, clothes were not; for example, in parts of the Bismarck Archipelago both sexes
wore nothing. In others, as Nakanai and part of Kove, only women wore clothing." Where
clothing was worn, bark-cloth was undoubtedly the most substantial wearable material. Leaves,
and to a lesser extent, grass, were used to fashion skirts, aprons and G-strings.



4.5.2. 1 Loincloth

   The following reconstruction of POc _*malo_ is soundly based, although there is doubt as to
whether the term can be traced back to an earlier stage. Blust (1970: 133) proposes PMP
_*maru_ 'loincloth', but notes the difficulty of reconciling the PMP form with the POc, with
the latter having unexplained _*0_ for expected _*u_ and _*l_ for expected _*r_. There can be little
doubt that the POc term referred to bark-cloth and a garment made from that material.

    Another apparent POc reconstruction for a loincloth, _*sulu_, with cognates in Kilivila (PT)
and New Ireland as well as in the central Pacific, is relegated to PCP or PPn on the grounds
that the term and garment were brought to New Guinea by Fijian and Polynesian missionaries
in the nineteenth century.


    The term _*tipi_ 'man's loincloth' perhaps had the generic sense 'man's clothing', as its
reflexes have been reinterpreted quite broadly with changes in sartorial customs.

4.5.2.2 Grass or leaf skirt


   Perhaps surprisingly, there is no widely reflected item for 'grass-skirt' or, more accurately,
'leaf skirt'. The set below has cognates in two primary subgroups, but, since the Admiralties
and the north coast of New Guinea were connected by trading links, it may be due to
borrowing.

   POc _*kaput_ and POc _*kopu_ have been mentioned in relation to the wrapping of food
before oven cooking (see Ch. 6, §3.7), although both are believed to have more general
reference (_*kaput_ 'wrap up, cover', _*kopu_ 'bundle up together'). It would seem that in Polynesia
their reflexes have also come to apply to the covering of the body, PPn _*kafu_ 'spread over,
cover the body (with a blanket)' PPn _*kofu_ 'wrap up; clothing'.



4.5.3 Paint, smear, anoint

   The practice of rubbing oil or grease on the body is known throughout the region, coconut
and candlenut oil being favoured, rather than the pig fat used in the Highlands. The practice
of painting red, yellow, black or white designs on the face and body with clay, lime etc. is
found mainly in Melanesia. POc _*lumu(k)_ most probably refers to oil. POc _*pani_ would seem
to cover both oiling and painting. Reflexes of POc _*lumut_ 'seaweed' and _*lumu(k)_ 'oil'
coincide in several SES languages, so the 'Are'are term appears to be a blend of the two
meanings, the idea of anointing with oil presumably introduced with Christianity.

    Chowning (p.48) mentions another form of body ornamentation, the blackening of teeth,
evidently widespread in Melanesia as far east as the Solomons. Seligman (1910:492) describes
the custom among the people of Tubetube (PT), in which fragments of a black bituminous
semi-fossilised wood called _tari_ are mixed into a paste with the chopped and roasted leaves
of the badira tree, and held against the teeth overnight. He gives the purpose of teeth
blackening as 'a means of personal adornment and to attract the opposite sex'. A reconstructed
form, _*tapal_, can be made for PWOc (the Sa'a term, _taha_ rather than the expected _aha_, has
to be considered a borrowing). Mikloucho-Maclay (1975:89) recorded in 1871 that "The
natives [of Astrolabe Bay] not only blacken their faces, but also the mouth (tongue, teeth,
gums, lips) with a substance which they chew." He gives the name _taval_ for this substance.
Although we cannot attribute _taval_ to a particular language (Mikloucho-Maclay lived in a
village of Papuan speakers), it is evidence that reflexes of _*tapal_ occur in the NNG area.

  SES: Sa'a            taha              'pigment made from river rock, used in teeth-blackening'
>

    A second reconstruction is PSS _*ogo_ 'tooth-blackening powder' (Lau _ago_, Kwaio _ogo_).
Ivens (1927 (reissued 1972):83) described the custom as practised by 'young men or girls,
who wish to give themselves airs', although later, (1930: 121) he wrote that "it was said to
preserve the teeth and prevent sore gums".



4.5.4 Tattooing

   Chowning (1991: 48) points out that tattooing in New Guinea has only limited distribution,
tending to be confined to people with relatively light skin. "Where it was practised, methods
ranged from the cutting of fine lines with obsidian, after which pigment was rubbed in, to the
use of special implements. Darker-skinned people practised ornamental cicatrisation." Although
no POc reconstruction has been made for the activity, reflexes of POc _*saRum_ (see §3.2.1)
indicate that a tattooing needle of bat's bone was known in both eastern and western Oceanic
as well as the Admiralties. In the east Oceanic region tattooing is widespread. It was practised
most extensively and reached its highest artistic development in Polynesia. A needle of bat or
bird bone was tapped repetitively with a mallet, and a dye, probably of vegetable origin,
rubbed into the punctured area. (Maoris used a dye made from the oily smoke of burning nut
kernels. In Bellona the sap of the _ŋieemuŋii_ tree - Canarium herveyii - was collected, allowed
to set, burnt and the carbon collected and scraped into a black powder (Tickle 1977: 11)). A
group of Samoic Outliers (Anuta, Luangiua, Takuu, Tikopia) use reflexes of PPn _*matau_
'axe' to refer to their tattooing chisel.

   The term tattoo is Polynesian in origin:

4.5.4. 1 Design


   Ross (1996c) has reconstructed a verb, _*noŋo_ 'decorate', used with reference to putting
patterns onto pots and other articles, and for tattooing, but his supporting data are limited to
three reflexes, and the reconstruction must be deemed tentative.

<

  NCV: Lewo                 nono            'tattoo, picture, image, idol'

   The kinds of designs used in tattooing, as on pottery and carved objects, and to a more
limited extent on baskets and mats, are a substantial study in themselves. Ross has identified
one pattern which reflects a familiar pattern in nature, the fishbone, and is found across a
range of crafts.

4.5.5 Ornaments

   Chowning (1991: 47) describes the situation in the New Guinea area:

|   Perhaps the most common everyday ornaments were necklaces of shell or animal teeth,
|   bracelets and armbands of a variety of materials, most often worn above the elbow, and ear
|   ornaments. Noses were usually pierced, but it is not clear how often nose ornaments were
|   worn. The other very common ornaments were leg bands, worn below the knee, and anklets;
|   belts and girdles; and hair ornaments, including ornamental combs. Aromatic herbs were
|   commonly stuck onto armbands and into the hair; feathers too, unmodified or made into
|   simple ornaments, were often stuck into the hair.

   Spriggs (1997a: 88) lists the distinctive range of shell ornaments recovered from Lapita
sites such as Eloaua in the Admiralties, Balof (New Ireland) and Arawe Islands south-west of
New Britain. They include Conus shell rectangular units, beads, rings and disks, Tridacna
rings, Spondylus beads and long units and Trochus armrings. Reconstructions have been
possible for armlets, pearlshell ornaments, ear decorations and for the act of stringing together
a necklace.

Although these examples are in theory sufficient to justify attributing to POc _*[la]lak[o]_ the
meaning 'bracelet' in addition to its shell meaning (see Shellfish, vol. 3), we cannot know if
both meanings were genuine inheritances in the daughter languages, or were simply associations
independently made.

   A similar reconstruction, referring both to a particular shell and to an ornament typically
made from it, is POc _*japi_.

   Shell items were evidently used not only for decoration but also strung together as a form
of wealth. Seligman (1910:514) writes of the Southern Massim:[9]

[9]  Seligman's work is an ethnography of the people who live in the region of Milne Bay, at the southeastern tip
  of mainland New Guinea. He does not specify language groups, but Wagawaga and Tubetube are among the
  languages spoken.


|   [Sapisapi] is a widely distributed name for the small red or purple discs made from the lip of
|   a bivalve shell which I believe is Chama pacifica. There are various qualities of sapisapi, and
|   these discs are worn singly as earrings (on a ring of turtle shell), or made up into such
|   standard ornaments as bagi or the necklaces called samakupa at Tubetube. Bagi are always
|   imported and never made locally either at Tubetube or Milne Bay, in both of which localities
|   they constitute the most valuable portable property a man can acquire.

4.6 Instruments of communication and music

   These fall into two main categories, a) wind instruments, and b) drums. Apart from the
conch shell trumpet, the wind instruments recorded in the ethnographic literature are usually
of bamboo, although Blackwood (1935: 413) describes a didgeridoo-type instrument, the
mabu, used on Buka, which is made from the trunk of a small tree. Bamboo instruments are
often simply referred to by the term for bamboo. The drums are typically wooden; but
occasionally lighter drums are made from larger varieties of bamboo. Where a skin head is
required, as in the hourglass drums, the skin of the monitor lizard is used where available. In
Polynesia (Rarotonga), sharkskin has been recorded as a drum skin.

   Other musical instruments mentioned in the ethnographic literature include Jew's-harps,
dancing sticks, a stringed bow and rattles made from seed pods or strings of shells.

4.6.3 Hourglass or kundu drum

                                                                     Household artefacts        109


   This relatively small drum, easily carried, is of wood, with the end covered in (lizard) skin.
Chowning (1991: 59) has noted that on the north coast of New Guinea and in some parts of
west New Britain the name for the instrument is suspiciously close to the word for 'monitor
lizard' (Sengseng _pahiyo_ 'drum', _apahiya_ 'lizard'). Drumming is produced with the hand, and
typically accompanies dances. Ivens (1927 (reissued 1972): 169) reports that "a true drum of
wood with skin stretched over it, such as is used in New Guinea and Torres Straits, is not
found on Mala [Malaita] and Ulawa".

The alternation in gloss between the two kinds of drum is probably due to the term for one
kind being used also as a generic. Chowning (1991: 60) reports that in Kove _kure_ can be used
for either instrument, although there is a separate term for slitgong.


4.6.4 Slitgong


   Slitgongs are carved from logs hollowed through a longitudinal slit, and beaten on one side
of the lip, usually with a single heavy stick. They are often played in unison, with different
logs producing different notes. The sound can carry over considerable distances and can be
used to convey simple messages, summon villagers, announce a feast or the death of someone
of rank and so on (Blackwood 1935: 409). They are large and heavy, often ornately carved,
and will normally survive for many years. They are almost always used horizontally. In the
entire Oceanic region, upright gongs, standing on their own, are found only in central Vanuatu
(Crowe 1996: 147). In southern Malaita (SES), somewhat smaller wooden gongs are placed
on stands and played in sets of three, loosely described as soprano, tenor and bass. These are
beaten with short sections of sago bark branches, pithy and soft (Ivens 1927 (reissued
1972): 169).

   Although words for musical instruments are candidates for borrowing, the fact that POc
final _*-t_ is regularly reflected or deleted throughout the cognate set below is a strong indication
that these terms are not borrowed.

4.8. Conclusions

Our reconstructions are for items which draw on a range of raw materials. They include:

__ul__
- vegetable products (a variety of timbers, bamboo, coconut shell, leaves, vine, cane and bark)
- stone (of variable quality, the most useful being obsidian, flint and basalt)
- coral and shell (Tridacna, Trochus, Conus, clam, pearlshell and others; turtle shell)
- animal products (bone, skin)
- earth products (pigments, earth, clay).

While most of these would be readily available throughout the western Oceanic region, two
in particular - obsidian and clay of good, workable quality - are limited in their distribution.
Although obsidian and clay pots were widely traded, cognate sets supporting reconstructions
are relatively few. The potting term evidence, however, for all its limitations, shows considerable
continuity of terms from PMP to POco The paucity of Oceanic terms may be due in part to
the scattered nature of pot-making settlements, together with the widespread replacement in
recent times of pots by tinware, but is also no doubt due to the long-term disappearance of
the skill in the eastern Oceanic region. Although traces of Lapita pots have been uncovered as
far east as Fiji-Tonga-Samoa, the manufacture and use of pottery was evidently abandoned
in Polynesia early in the first millenium AD (Kirch 1997:68). Fiji is the most easterly place
where pottery manufacture survives in the Pacific. In the Solomons, archaeologists have
found few traces of pottery other than some scattered remains on Buka Island (Kirch 1997:53),
and, more recently, in Marovo Lagoon, western Solomons (Peter Shepherd, pers.comm.).

   Nor has reconstructing a term for obsidian been straightforward. As a glance at the glosses
will show, there is considerable variation in meaning from place to place, with the obsidian
term being used at times for other sharp stones, for a razor, for the head of a spear or an
arrow, and as a cutting verb.

                           114 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


    As one moves east, from N.W. Melanesia and the Solomons out into the Pacific, the range
of plant and animal life becomes less, with coral atolls having the most restricted environments.
Shell increases in importance, while hard stone capable of taking an edge becomes rare.
Terms to do with mats and weaving and bark-cloth manufacture increase in number and
show increased specialization. Tattooing becomes more widespread. These are most likely
indicators of developing elaborations after the break-up of POc.

    Household artefacts varied greatly in the degree to which they were manufactured. A
few--coconut-shell containers and shell scrapers-would have been functional more or less in
their natural state. Most items were manufactured to some degree, either with use of tools or
through skilful manipulation of the raw material. Axe and adze heads had to be shaped and
fitted with a handle; wooden bowls required tools that cut and shaped and gouged, smaller
versions of the tools used in canoe manufacture. Mats and baskets ranged from the very
simple to the intricately shaped and patterned, serving not only as domestic items but also as
house walls and canoe sails. Cordage produced not only bags but also a range of fishing nets.

    Pottery would seem to be the household artefact requiring the most complex stages of
manufacture. There would have been little need of tools beyond paddle (POc _*tapi_) and anvil
(POc _*patu_ 'stone'). However, stages would include preparation of the clay involving tempering
with sand, moulding, decorating, drying, firing, and, for some, sealing with a vegetable
 caulking agent.[11] One would assume that this kind of knowledge would be accumulated over
a long period of trial and error, and probably passed down as an integrated procedure. We
know that in more recent times the skill of making pots was a jealously guarded trade secret,
not one that could simply be copied by examining the final product.

    One further point that can be made about POc artefacts is that at least some of them
demonstrated a desire by their makers to produce something that was more than simply
functional. Although this point is illustrated most vividly by archaeological findings dating
back to POc times, particularly the early Lapita pots, the mere existence of such decorative
 items as earrings, arm rings and combs points to a desire for some SOlt of ornamentation,
some kind of artistic expression.

[11] See Ross (1996c) for more detail of these processes.




5 Horticultural practices


5.1 Introduction

     It is claimed that one of the distinguishing features of the Lapita culture is the movement
out into the Pacific of a wide range of domesticated plants, and that Lapita represents, in the
Bismarcks and Solomons, the first clear evidence for an agricultural base to the economy, a
base apparently little changed until this century (see Pawley & Green 1973, Shutler & Marck 1975, Spriggs 1997a).[1]

     Early this century, ethnographers such as Malinowski (1935) for the Trobriands, Blackwood (1935) 
for north Bougainville and Ivens (1927 (reissued 1972)) for the Southeast Solomons,
described communities in which the people were, above all, gardeners. Their gardens provided
a basis for their settlement size and determined the nature and division of labour. Much of
the ritual and magic practised related to the stages of cultivation and growth and harvest.
Their produce excessive to daily needs fuelled their festivals, it was their standby in times of
food scarcity, and their trading currency. Reciprocal obligations to kin were expressed in
foodstuffs exchanged. Years were calculated in terms of annual crop cycles - an event might
have ocurred two yam crops ago or could be expected after the next galip nut harvest.

     Over one hundred POc food plant terms have now been reconstructed (see Food Plants in
vol 3, an earlier version of which has been published as Ross 1996d). Here, however, we are
concerned, not with the terms for the plants themselves (these are listed where relevant, but
without supporting data) but rather, with terms for gardens and for activities associated with
gardening.

    A considerable debt is owed to the unpublished 1983 thesis of Renwick French-Wright,
Proto Oceanic Horticultural Practices, a work which travelled much the same road as this
chapter does, and many of whose cognate sets have been included here. Because more
stringent subgrouping requirements apply today before a reconstruction can be identified as
POc, some revision of his reconstructions has been necessary - usually involving downgrading
from POc to PEOc.

[1] I am indebted to Michael Bourke, Ann Chowning and Matthew Spriggs for a host of useful comments, to
    Malcolm Ross for adding to and tidying up many of my reconstructions, and to Jean Kennedy who drew
    my attention to P. H McEldowney's thesis, Subsistence intensification in the late prehistory of Manus.

5.2 Background

    Almost all of Melanesia lies within the humid tropics and experiences high rainfall. Apart
from areas round Port Moresby and the west coast of New Caledonia, which receive less than
1,000 mm per annum, most of Melanesia averages above 2,500 mm, while south-west New
Britain receives over 6,000 mm. Seasonal variation of rainfall is due primarily to the changing
trade wind cycle, and can best be described as variation between 'fairly wet' and 'very wet',
although major droughts can occur from time to time. As Ann Chowning (pers.comm.) points
out, one of the primary components of garden magic is weather magic. There is little seasonal
variation in temperature. Most Austronesian settlement is close to the sea, where maximum
temperatures are around 30-32 °C, with minima around 23 °C. Associated with these factors
are high humidity and cloudiness (McAlpine, Keig & Falls 1983: 3, 61 -66). The natural
vegetation cover is tropical forest. Even in the drier areas, savanna woodland is the natural
plant cover.

    There is broad general agreement that the Austronesian-speaking people who first ventured
into Melanesia practised a swidden style of gardening, centred on the cultivation of tubers,
particularly taro (Colocasia esculenta) in the wetter areas and various varieties of yam
(Dioscorea) in the drier regions (Brookfield & Hart 1971, Yen 1973). Some of their practices,
however, may have been adopted from Papuan speakers who had practised agriculture in
New Guinea for millennia before Austronesian speakers arrived. Brookfield and Hart (1971)
made an exhaustive survey of forty-four places, fourteen of which are Austronesian
settlements[2], in order to identify, as best they could, the environment and land use in 'Old
Melanesia', the region as it was before external forces began to radically modify the man-
environment systems. These provide a good representative sample of traditional methods
across the region, and incidentally cover the major linguistic subgroups from New Guinea to
Fiji, together with the Samoic outlier of Tikopia. The factors they considered were location
(distance from the sea), elevation, topography, rainfall regime, biotic environment (soil and
vegetation type), wild food sources, traditional crops, cultivation methods, cultivation frequency
and crop segregation. With the exception of the locations in Fiji, New Caledonia and Tikopia,
which have developed more intensive systems, all these places employed what was 'a set of
variations on the classic swidden or shifting cultivation system.' (p. 108)

|   soil with a stick before inserting the seed tuber or cutting, or occasionally, as at Roviana,
|   making small mounds. Gardens are generally used only once, though sometimes subsidiary
|   crops are planted after the main crop, and remain longer in the ground. Useful trees continue
|   to provide fruit for some time after the garden has been relinquished to wild growth. Crops
|   are usually planted among the fallen trees and ash … [although] ash is sometimes thrown out
|   of the garden before planting, or else piled around stumps where it is of no direct use to the
|   plant. Occasionally ash is piled around particular plants which are thought to benefit from
|   such treatment, but not around others.
|       There is sometimes a little crop segregation, but it is quite subsidiary … Most gardens are
|   untidy, littered with the fallen trunks of trees and quickly invaded by weeds. Because of wild
|   and domesticated pigs, most gardens are fenced. Weeding is sometimes done in the early
|   months but is never continued beyond the lifting of the main crop. (Brookfield & Hart
|   1971: 107-108)

   Rarer techniques within what was still essentially a swidden system included tillage in
some grassland areas to eradicate grassroots and aerate the soil; the planting of yams in
specially prepared pits which were composted with a mixture of leaves, grass and soil (e.g. in
Mapos Buang (NNG)); and employing rudimentary irrigation (e.g. in Seniang (NCV)). Locations
in Fiji, New Caledonia and the Solomons were distinguished by more advanced irrigation
systems, permitting some continuous cultivation of the same plots.

[2]  They are Buang and Wogeo (NNG); Dobu and the Trobriands (PT); Sengseng in W. N. Britain (also NNG);
  Roviana (New Georgia, Sols.) (MM); Langalanga in Malaita (SES); inland Santo and Seniang (both NCV);
  Loyalty Islands; New Caledonia; two locations in Fiji (Rewa Delta and Moala in the northern Lau group)
  and the Samoic outlier, Tikopia (pn).



5.3 Land usage

   For swidden agriculturalists, land could be classified in one of three ways - as land under
cultivation or ready for cultivation, as old garden land now lying fallow, and as uncleared
'bush' or forest. The following reconstructions illustrate.

5.3.1 Garden

>

Three MM languages (Bulu, Kia and Roviana) reflect POc _*q<in>uma_ <NOM> + 'garden' (on
nominalisers, see Ch. 2, §3.2.1), suggesting perhaps that at least in the early MM linkage,
_*quma_ was a verb meaning 'make a garden ', _*q<in>uma_ the product of that activity. The
following item betrays a similar pattern.

Ross (1994a) has reconstructed Proto Central Papuan _*v<in>ayula_ 'do work ' (Hula _inayulu_,
Lala _vinaula_, Kuni _bilaula_, East Mekeo _pinauna_). Central Papuan languages reflect POc
final consonants only in borrowings from other PT languages, so _*v<in>ayula_ points to PPT
_*b<in>aqura_, POc _*(b,bʷ)dmaku(r,R)_. The presence of the nominaliser _*<in>_ suggests that
_*(b,bʷ)aku(r,R)_ was a verb.

The Mussau and Tolo reflexes mean 'garden': this change of meaning is probably due to the
fact that, in Melanesia, gardens are often remote from the village and surrounded by
bushland, so that to go to the garden is to go into the bush.

5.4. Soil


   The meaning of earth as soil would seem to be the central meaning of POc _*tanoq_ (cf.
POc _*panua_ whose extended meanings included (1) inhabited area or territory; (2) community
together with its land and things on it; (3) land, not sea; see Ch. 3, §3.7).

>

The form POc _*tano(q)_ given in vol. 1, p.119 has now been revised to _*tanoq_. Evidence supporting final
_*-q_ lies in the retention of a final vowel in Kwamera (John Lynch, pers. comm.) and Iaai 
(Françoise Ozanne-Rivierre, pers. comm.).

5.5. Preparation of ground

   New gardens are traditionally prepared along the following lines. First, the undergrowth
and vines and small trees are cleared. Before the introduction of metal implements, this
would have been done with a large digging stick used as a crowbar (§S.S) and perhaps a stone
axe (POc _*kiRam_, Ch. 4, §4.1.1), together with smaller cutting implements made of bamboo
or shell. Large trees may be left standing, although branches may be lopped off to admit
maximum sunlight. Alternatively, they may be slowly killed off by ringbarking or by burning
rubbish heaped round their base. Debris is usually left to dry and then burnt, with the ashes
fertilizing the soil. The ground can then be raked or picked over, and remaining rubbish
removed, together with any weeds which have survived the burning.

   Although pigs usually have an unwanted, destructive effect on gardens, in some areas pigs
are allowed to root in ground that has been harvested of its tubers. This contributes to turning
over the soil in preparation for a second crop.

5.5.5 Digging stick


   Two kinds of digging stick may be physically differentiated - the longer, heavier version
used to break up the surface of the soil, and the smaller dibble used to poke holes in the soil
for planting. These are seldom, if ever, differentiated in word lists and it may be that most
languages use the same term for both.

5.6 Fence

   Great damage can be done to gardens wherever there are bush pigs or wallabies. Although
wallabies are not found in the Solomons or places east, wild pigs are found throughout
virtually all of Melanesia. In these places, preparation of a garden usually includes construction
of a strong fence. In addition to POc _*baRa_ 'fence, wall, enclosure' (see Ch. 3, §3.6), a term
which evidently encompasses all kinds of fences and walls, there are several terms which
may apply more specifically to garden enclosures made of logs or stakes.

   Ross Clark (pers.comm.) has pointed out that PPn _*loto-qa_ is reconstructable (where _*-qa_
reflects POc _*qaRa(r)_); this is evidently a fossilised compound, literally 'inside the fence',
which in a number of Polynesian languages (Emae, Samoan, Tongan, Tikopia) means 'a
garden'.

5.7    Food plants[5]

[5]   The reconstructions listed in this section are from Ross (1996d). See also Food Plants, vol. 3.

   The two staples, taro and yams, would have primarily determined the nature of gardening
activities, although the degree to which each is cultivated and the varieties favoured may vary
from place to place. The two follow a different growth cycle. Malinowski (1935: 296) describes
the situation in the Trobriands:

|     Taro differs considerably from both yams and taytu [small yams] in the time it takes to
|     mature, the conditions in which it thrives and in its capacity for being stored. Its period of
|     growth is much shorter… There can… be three taro crops in a year, as against one for both
|     yams and taytu.

Ivens (1927 (reissued 1972):355) describes the practice at Sa'a and Ulawa, in the Southeast
Solomons, where the staple crops are yams, hana (a prickly yam regarded as distinct from a
yam) and taro, the latter being grown in a separate plot.

|     The bush (inland) people grow taro and hana… My lists contain names of sixty varieties of
|     yams, twenty of hanas and a hundred and twenty of taro, the large number of taro showing
|     that the people were originally dwellers of the high lands. All of these varieties are cultivated
|     and the differences between them recognised. In a taro garden the tubers are pulled as
|     required, the tops are replanted, the suckers are planted out and clearing goes on all the year
|     through, but yams and hanas have a regular season and only one crop. New ground is cleared
|     for the yams and hanas every year, and the same ground is never planted twice, fertilizers
|     being unknown. The old yam gardens serve for bananas and pawpaws, and for the planting of
|     betel pepper, and the edible reed awalosi. Different words are used to denote the clearing for
|     a yam garden, and the clearing for taro.

     In a description of traditional gardens on Manus Island in the Admiralties, McEldowney (1995:98) 
describes the yams Dioscorea esculenta (_suwe_) and D. alata (_meyen_) as completely
dominating, with only limited amounts of taro (Colocasia esculenta) sometimes found along
the boundary walls of the garden.

    Food plants other than tubers would require little labour. The most significant are breadfruit
(also a staple in some places), some banana varieties, sugarcane and greens. Sago is eaten in
the absence of other staples. The coconut might also be regarded as a staple, the plant's use,
as with sago, extending beyond that of a foodstuff. Together with other fruit and nut trees,
all of these are found in the wild, sometimes 'managed' as semi-wild, but also planted in
garden plots, where they remain while the plots undergo their cycle of fallow.

     William Clarke (1994: 13) has commented on the importance of arboriculture to Oceanic
peoples:

|     A striking characteristic of what can now be interpreted as an independent origin of agriculture
|     in western Melanesia is its emphasis on arboriculture-the culture of trees-Qrchards. Trees
|     were transported Pacific-wide, carried by the itinerant colonist-cultivators, incorporated into
|     all production systems and begot the typical village environs of Polynesia and Micronesia
|   (Yen 1990). Some nut and fruit trees and sago dropped out before reaching the farther islands
|   of the eastern and northern Pacific. Archaeological evidence for a well-developed arboriculture
|   at least 3,500 years ago comes from the Mussau Islands, north of New Ireland (Kirch 1989).
|   Arboreal species existing at this considerable time depth included: coconut, two or three
|   species of Pandanus, Inocarpus fag ife r (the 'Tahitian chestnut', which remains one of the
|   most important Oceanic arboricultural species), Canarium indicum (a nutritionally substantial
|   'almond' -producing tree in Melanesia), Spondias dulcis (the vi-apple, now of very wide
|   distribution in the tropical Pacific), Pometia, Pangium, Terminalia, Burckella, Calophyllum,
|   and others, including hardwood trees widely prized for woodworking.

   We have reconstructions going back at least as far as PMP for two kinds of taro 
(Colocasia esculenta and Alocasia macrorrhiza), the greater yam, bananas, breadfruit and sago. Other
food plants, such as sugar cane, may have been indigenous to New Guinea. The sweet potato
is of South American origin, and was probably introduced into New Guinea-north-west
Melanesia after AD 1550, though it was introduced into Polynesia in pre-contact times (Yen 1973).

   Ross (1996d) includes the following POc reconstructions for items he classifies as "staples

No doubt a variety of green leaves were eaten but other reconstructions (e.g. *kusa(q)) do

*qalip 'canarium almond, Canarium sp.';
*talise 'Java almond, Indian almond, Terminalia catappa';
*qipi 'Tahitian chestnut, Pacific chestnut, Inocarpus fagifer' (syn. Inocarpus edulis).';

No garden is complete or likely to succeed without an abundance of colourful and aromatic
herbs and shrubs. In addition to their ornamental qualities, these herbs and shrubs play a
major role in various forms of garden magic and ritual. Reconstructions for two such are
*laqia 'ginger, Zingiber officinale', whose role is magical rather than culinary, and *yaŋo
'turmeric, Curcuma longa', which has both an edible root and a rich orange pigment, of
ritual significance in many Oceanic societies.


[6]  Ross (1996d:210) warns that we cannot be completely sure of the original POc referents of _*pau(q)_ and
  _*wai_. Although both terms are reconstructable to PMP, their referents have apparently undergone some
  switching, with the sweet-tasting Mangifera indica being introduced from Asia at a date probably well
  after the break-up of POc, to supplement the indigenous Mangifera minor and Mangifera foetida varieties.

5.8 Planting

5.8.1 Propagation material

    Taro is propagated either by replanting the cut-off top of a tuber or by transplanting the
suckers that grow around the 'mother' taro. Alternatively, these are simply left in the ground
after the mature taro has been harvested. Reconstructed terms for this propagation material
may refer to other plants in addition to taro. They are POc _*(s,j)uli(q)_ 'banana or taro sucker,
slip, cutting, shoot (i.e. propagation material)'; POc _*wasi_ 'taro stem, used for planting'; POc
_*bʷaŋo_ 'taro tops, top shoots of areca nut, coconut' and POc _*up(e,a)_ 'taro seedling'.

   These four items refer to parts of a plant which are used in its propagation. Except
perhaps for POc _*wasi_ 'taro stem, used for planting', they refer to the relevant parts of other
plants, as well as taro. However, as Ross points out (1996d: 180), in each case generic
reference is to taro. In several Central Papuan languages (Motu and its relatives), reflexes of
POc _*(s,j)uli(q)_ have become the generic term for banana.

   One 'cutting' term has been reconstructed which may refer to the severing of anything
from its parent body, such as hair or leaves, but whose reflexes in North New Guinea, the
Southeast Solomons and Micronesia have also come to apply specifically to the action of
cutting off tuber tops.

   Propagation of yams is generally by seed yams, small healthy yams selected from the
previous year's crop, or by slices of larger yams. Ross has reconstructed PWOc _*kapul_ 'seed
yam'.

5.8.3 Yam mound

   Barrau (1955: 56) describes cultivation of yams in Melanesia:

|   As a general rule, yams flourish on light, deep and well-drained soils. These requirements
|   have led the natives to perfect cultural techniques which are often most ingenious. The
|   simplest consists of carefully earthing up the plant. Sometimes a large ridge of well-worked
|   soil is made… surrounded by draining ditches.

'yam mound'.

Only a single Oceanic reflex has been located for this reconstruction, from the most easterly
extension of Melanesia. This raises two questions. Firstly, why are there not WOc cognates?
If the term reached this point, retaining its PMP meaning, it must have been a familiar one
in the intervening regions. This situation arises often enough in linguistic reconstruction,
and may be due to any number of sociolinguistic variables or perhaps to shortfalls in
available word lists. It is of course possible that our searches have simply not located
cognates that exist elsewhere. But the fact remains that most of the cultivated plants for
which we have POc reconstructions are propagated by planting parts of the plant other than
its seeds. Secondly, are we overlooking the existence of plants that are cultivated from seed
but are seldom recorded in word lists, perhaps being of minor importance in the diet, or
subsumed under a more generalised term such as 'greens'. One such plant may be an
Amaranthus (Amaranthus tricolor), recorded as an indigenous food plant by Quiros on his
visits to Santa Cruz and Espiritu Santo at the beginning of the seventeenth century 
(Markham 1904:50). Another pre-European plant in New Guinea whose leaves are eaten is a nasturtium
species found in the lowlands (Nasturtium hybospermum). It is a widespread practice today
for bunches of these plants, with seed pods, to be hung up to dry until such time as a new
garden is prepared. The seeds are then broadcast into the soil surface. Other contenders
may be legumes, such as the winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus)[8] and Lablab
purpureus, both of which may date from pre-contact times (pers.comm. Michael Bourke).
The association of these or similar plants with POc speakers will, however, depend on our
reconstruction of appropriate terms.

[8]   The Sengseng grow these beans, but do not sow the seeds (Ann Chowning, pers.comm.).

5.10 Gathering, harvesting

   We have not identified a reconstruction specifically for the digging up of tubers, either
with or without the use of a digging stick, although _*kali_/_*keli_ (§5 ,4) is apparently a general
term whose meaning includes this activity. It is possible that terms included under the heading
'weeding' were sometimes used to refer to pulling any plant out of the soil. Ann Chowning
(pers.comm.) points out that, density of soil permitting, taro is often harvested by being
pulled out directly by its thick stem, whereas yams have to be dug up. The reconstructions
below relate to the gathering of fruit and nuts and sometimes leaves. They carry distinctions
made on the basis of whether the item is plucked by hand, or with the aid of a stick or hook.

For the implement, Polynesian languages use terms derived from PPn _*lohu_ 'fruit-plucking
pole, hook something with a pole' (Biggs 1993).

   The set above bears a formal and semantic resemblance to PMP/POc _*kawil_ 'hook, fish

5.11 Storage: yam storehouse

     The yam is the only tropical tuber which is easily preserved, provided it is placed in an
airy, dry, dark and cool spot. It was a community's safeguard at times when the regular
supply of foodstuffs was low. From New Guinea to New Caledonia, in areas where yam is
the staple food, special huts are found in which they are preserved (Barrau 1955:58).
Malinowski (1935: 218) reports that in the Trobriands such structures (_bwema_) were given a more prominent
position in the village than the family dwellings, and were more meticulously decorated and
maintained. POc _*pale_ 'open-sided building', has been reconstructed (Ch. 3, §3.3), reflexes
of which in some instances refer to yam storehouses (NNG: Lukep (Pono) _para_ 'yam house';
SES: Arosi (E. dialect) _hare_ 'shed for yams'). No term has been reconstructed that refers
specifically to a hut for storing yams. In Mapos Buang (South Huon Gulf), yam houses are
called _jok_. In Nengone, Loyalty Islands, _methuma_ is the term for a harvest hut for yams.



5.12 Drainage and Irrigation

   Water control has two opposing functions: (1) to aid drainage in wet areas, and (2) to
carry water to drier areas. The New Guinea area apparently concentrated its developments
towards the former, particularly in yam gardens, through such means as mounding and
ditching (Yen 1973: 83). In areas with lower or less reliable rainfall, it has long been the
practice to irrigate - particularly the water-loving taro crops, whose yield can be considerably
increased. For various reasons, including the fact that a more restricted environment limits
crop choice, irrigated taro fields are more a feature of eastern Oceanic than of the west.
Kirch and Lepofsky (1993: 185) have written:

|   As archaeological and ethnobotanical data on the distribution of Oceanic irrigation technology
|   accumulated, it became evident that the widespread distribution of both pondfield and raised-bed
|   agricultural technologies in Polynesia was not matched by an equally extensive distribution
|   in Melanesia… Although there are 'pockets' of highly intensive taro pondfield irrigation in
|   Melanesia (notably in the New Georgia group of the western Solomons, on Anejom in
|   Vanuatu (Spriggs 1981), and in New Caledonia (Barrau 1956)), on most of the intervening
|   islands (including the large island of New Guinea [but presumably excluding the Western
|   Highlands systems of the Papuans mentioned below (m.o.)]) irrigation is absent.

                                                                           Horticultural practices      139


   The question to be resolved is whether the early Oceanic gardeners were familiar with
what might be called more sophisticated irrigation techniques, or whether the knowledge was
acquired later. Proto Oceanic speakers were generally coastal and island dwellers, far removed
geographically from Papuan-speaking peoples of the New Guinea Highlands who may have
been associated with ditch systems in the growing of taro as long ago as 6000 BP (Golson 1990, 
Swadling & Muke 1998). More feasible is the possibility that POc knowledge was
passed down from Southeast Asian forebears. Although Southeast Asian paddies were used
predominantly for rice growing, taro is reportedly grown in similar fashion in parts of the
northern Philippines, south-west Sulawesi and Java (Spriggs 1981: 173).

  Kirch and Lepofsky (1993: 196) considered both linguistic and archaeological evidence
and concluded that:

|      neither body of evidence lends support to the… model for the origins of Polynesian irrigation
|      technology, [which proposes] a direct transfer or diffusion from Southeast Asia via the
|      migrations of Austronesian-speaking peoples. Rather, all of the evidence suggests that there
|      have been multiple local sequences of innovation and development of complex irrigation or
|      swamp drainage technology, or both, for Colocasia taro cultivation within eastern Melanesia
|      and Polynesia.

    Working from our own linguistic sources, which include possibly more data from Western
Oceanic languages than were available to Kirch and Lepofsky, we have not been able to add
a single cognate set to those already listed by the latter.[9] No reconstructions have been
possible for such concepts as ditch or water channel or irrigated garden. A single reconstruction
is possible to PCP level.

[9]   One of the few detailed accounts of intensive irrigation on mainland New Guinea is Kahn (1984).

<
PCP *vusi 'taro swamp; taro bed' (from French-Wright)
    Fij:   Bauan              vuði                 'taro garden under wet cultivation'
    Pn:    Samoan             fusi                 'raised bed'
    Pn:    E. Futunan         vusi(ga)             'pondfield'
    Pn:    E. Uvean           fuhi                 'raised bed'
>

FIXME: In vol. 1, p.139 the form PCP _*pusi_ was erroneously given for _*vusi_ (POc _*p_ split into PCP _*p_ and _*v_).

    A second reconstruction is open to conjecture. Both Spriggs and Kirch and Lepofsky drew
attention to the Hawaiian and Rapa (Austral Islands) terms for a pondfield, _loʔi_ and _roki_. We
have a tentative reconstruction POc _*logi_ meaning something like 'partition, partitioned area'
with a reflex from Hote in the Huon Gulf (NNG), _lok_ '(garden) fence; wall of house' (Ch. 3, §3 .S).

<
POc *logi 'partition, partitioned area'
  NNG: Hote           lok        '(garden) fence; wall of house'
  Mic: Kiribatese     roki       'screen (of mats +); curtain; bathroom; closed with screen' (possibly borrowed from Polynesian)
  Fij: Rotuman        loki       'the end of the interior of a house'
  Fij: Bauan          loqi       'inner or private part of a house, used as a bedroom and for keeping valuables'
  Pn:  Tongan         loki       'inner room'
  Pn:  Samoan         loʔi       'inner room'
  Pn:  Rapa           roki       'irrigated terrace'
  Pn:  Tahitian       roʔi       'bed'
  Pn:  Hawaiian       loʔi       'irrigated terrace for taro'
  Pn:  Tuamotuan      roki       'wall of a temple; bed, couch'
  cf. also:
  SES: Gela           voki       'room, partition in a house'
>

The Polynesian reflexes, apart from the Rapa and Hawaiian terms, have the sense of 'inner
room, room for sleeping' or similar. However, it is conceivable that the POc term did have
a more generalised meaning and could be applied to any partitioned area, whether house or
garden. Its reference to an irrigated partitioned area remains a localised one.


140 Meredith Osmond


    In spite of remarkable similarities of technique commented on by Matthew Spriggs
(pers.comm.) in islands throughout eastern Oceania, including New Georgia, Guadalcanal,
Maewo, Santo, New Caledonia, Fiji and a number of Polynesian islands, and possibly also
New Hanover in the Bismarck Archipelago, archaeological findings to date would seem to
support the theory that more complex irrigation systems are not as old as Oceanic settlement.
Although many of these systems have fallen into disuse since European contact (largely as
the result of dramatic decline in population that came about with exposure to European
diseases), our best evidence for their existence is in the physical traces left by their water
channels, sometimes stone-lined, and their banks and terraces. More recently, archaeologists
have, under certain conditions, been able to identify soil strata that have at some time in the
past been subjected to pondfield irrigation (Spriggs 1997b: 84-85). Spriggs reports on one
such site in Hawaii now dated to 1500 BP, the earliest date yet for evidence of pondfield
irrigation (p.89). In New Caledonia, a buried taro pondfield terrace at Col de Piroque has
been dated back to 1150-1100 BP (p. 184). Other evidence points to more recent dating. On
Aneityum, Spriggs estimates that the large-scale canal-fed irrigation systems of the valley
flats have been constructed within the period since about 500-600 BP (Spriggs 1986: 11).
Oldest evidence for the Solomons remains the eye-witness report of the explorer Mendafia in
1568 (Amherst & Thomson 1901: 306).



5.13 Gaps in reconstructions

    Other concepts for which we currently lack reconstructions include a term for the stakes
or supports on which the yam vines were trained. French-Wright (1983: 64-65) lists a variety
of ways in which vines can be supported. In addition to stakes, they include, in the Admiralties
and the Trobriands, saplings left standing after the garden has been cleared; in the centre of
Guadalcanal in the Solomons the vines trail over felled trees; in the Loyalty Islands an
arrangement rather like an upturned basket is used, and on Efate, Vanuatu, a trellis-like
structure is built over the yam mounds. French-Wright suggests that perhaps the lack of
cognates denoting this basic feature of yam cultivation is due to the wide variety of support
systems used, in other words, that each cultural adaptation has led to changes in terminology.

    Gardens in the Trobriands (Malinowski 1935: 55, 121) and in Malaita, Southeast Solomons
(Ivens 1927 (reissued 1972):356), and elsewhere, are divided into sub-plots by means of
criss-crossing logs laid on the ground, but we have been unable to reconstruct terms for either
the plots or the dividing logs, although these are named in their own communities.

                                                                   Horticultural practices        141


   A term must surely have existed for the period or activity of yam harvesting, which was
frequently carried out by the whole community at the one time and typically accompanied by
certain rituals. It does seem, however, that POc speakers associated the period of yam
harvest with the conclusion of an annual cycle. In a number of widespread localities, past and
future events are placed in time by referring to yam crop cycles, thus according the terms a
meaning equivalent to our concept of 'year' (PT: Kilivila _tetu_ 'small yam (the main staple);
year'; NNG: Mapos Buang _ta_ 'year; a complete cycle of yam growing'; NCV: Paamese _ouh_
'a yam; a year'). Similarly, Ivens (1927:358) writes, "Our [English] word year would be
rendered in a Melanesian language (Sa'a halisi, Lau, Kwaiofalisi 'yam harvest, yam season,
year'] by whatever is equivalent to the yam crop."



5.14 Archaeological evidence

   Archaeological evidence in support of POc horticultural practices comes, not from discovery
of items of material culture, but in the form of the products of horticulture, and, less directly,
from apparent sudden and dramatic changes in land use following settlement by POc speakers.

Kirch (1997: 203-205) writes:

|   Direct archaeobotanical evidence for horticulture, in the form of preserved plant remains,
|   largely eluded prior generations of Oceanic archaeologists… Then, during the 1986 excavation
|   season at the waterlogged Talepakemalai site in the Mussau Islands, we were suddenly
|   confronted with an unprecedented array of well-preserved (non-carbonised) plant remains.
|   Sealed in an anaerobic, wet environment, the literally thousands of seed cases, endocarps,
|   husks, syncarps, and other plant material, along with wood (including adzed wood chips)
|   opened up a new window on Lapita relations to the plant world. Subsequently, a similar
|   assemblage of preserved plant parts was also recovered by Chris Gosden … at his Arawe
|   Island sites. The plant parts preserved… are primarily woody or fibrous, such as seed cases,
|   fibrous husks, and wood. Soft, fleshy materials such as tubers or the soft flesh of fruits have
|   not survived.

Among the food plants identified from archaeological sites are Canarium almond (Canarium indicum), 
Indian almond (Terminalia catappa), the New Guinea walnut (Dracontomelon dao), 
Pometia pinnata, Burckella obovata, Tahitian chestnut (lnocarpus fagiferus) and
vi-apple (Spondias dulcis) (Kirch 1997: 206-207).

   The second source of evidence, modification of the landscape, supports the POc horticultural
practice of swidden cultivation. Spriggs (1997a:85-86) describes the dramatic change in land
use that coincides with the influx of Lapita people, a change particularly evident in the
previously uninhabited islands east of the Solomons. Spriggs postulates initial settlement with
large-scale clearance for agriculture, as indicated in the pollen record which shows suddenly
high carbonised particle counts resulting from burning. This is typically followed by
environmental degradation such as increased erosion rates, and often the extinction of endemic
species of birds and reptiles resulting mainly from habitat alteration. Such changes have been
documented for Aneityum in Vanuatu occurring about 2,900 years ago and for Fiji perhaps
by 1200 BC (Kirch 1997:222).

142 Meredith Osmond

   A third potential source of evidence would lie in physical traces of irrigation systems and
associated terracing. To date, however, neither linguistic nor archaeological evidence can
support the association of sophisticated irrigation practices with POc speakers (see § 12).


5.15 Conclusion

   Proto Oceanic speakers cultivated their gardens with a minimum of implements other than
their hands. Apart from the axe (_*kiRam_) and smaller cutting implements of bamboo or shell
such as _*piso_ or PEOc _*sele_ (Ch. 4, §4.1.2) used in clearing their plots, the only tools were a
digging stick for tillage (_*waso_), possibly a dibble stick for planting (for which we lack a
reconstructed term other than that for digging stick) and a hooked stick (_*kawit_) for picking
fruit and nuts. The POc reconstructions to do with horticulture refer primarily to gardening
activities: clearing, burning, weeding, digging, planting, picking and gathering. Also represented
are the processes undergone by the plants themselves-sprouting, growing, swelling, ripening,
withering.

   We have no evidence that any form of fertilising was used, apart from the occasional
spreading of ash from the burning off of new garden plots. There is no tradition of composting
the soil with human waste, for instance. Mulching and digging-in of decomposed vegetable
matter have been recorded in places as traditional gardening practice, but we have no specific
reconstructions for these activities. Nor has linguistics shed any light on ways in which they
may have attempted to control pests or diseases. Weight was given rather to magic, as a
means of ensuring healthy crops.

   Finally, we have no evidence from reconstructions that Proto Oceanic speakers irrigated
their crops in any systematic way. Current archaeological findings support the view that
elaborate systems are a more recent, independent development.

   Brookfield and Hart (1971: 81) observe that "cultivation techniques move less easily than
crops, for while the latter can be transmitted from hand to hand, the former generally require
migrants to carry their skills and adapt them to a new environment". It is likely that the
horticultural knowledge carried into the region by the first POc speakers would have included
at the very least, awareness of preferred conditions for the cultivation of various kinds of
taro and yams, together with related knowledge of growth stages, propensity for storage and
propagation techniques for these and other garden plants such as sugar cane and bananas.

6.1 Introduction

    Much of this chapter is reproduced from Lichtenberk (1994), reordered and slightly revised
in the light of more stringent subgrouping assumptions. To that work have been added a
number of terms related to fire and its accompaniments. Organization of the chapter is (1)
fire and the fireplace; (2) cooking methods; (3) preservation and (4) food processing.



6.2 Fire and the fireplace

6.2.1 Fire plough

   Fire was produced throughout the Oceanic world by friction. Often this was achieved by
rubbing a piece of wood rapidly to and fro along a long groove or furrow cut into a second
piece of wood. We have a term specifically for the action of lighting a fire with fire-plough.
Note that the Central Pacific terms have unexplained vowel fronting.

   Biggs (1993) has reconstructed PPn _*kau-natu_, for the implement used. Although this
compound is derived from POc elements (POc _*kaiu_ 'tree, wood, stick' and POc _*natu_
'child'), we have no proof that the compound itself is POc. We can be confident, however,
that the term is older than PPn, given that POc _*kaiu_ was replaced by PPn _*raqakau_ 'wood,
tree', and POc _*natu_ by PPn _*tama_ 'child '.

   A separate term for the upper frictioning stick can be reconstructed, but only for the
Central Eastern subgroup of Polynesia:

<
PCEPn *kau-lima 'upper frictioning stick of fire-plough' ('stick' + 'hand')
  Pn:    Hawaiian        ʔau-lima          'stick held in the hand when making fire'
  Pn:    Maori           kau-rima-rima      'upper stick of fire-plough'
  Pn:    Tuamotuan       kau-rima           'the upper frictioning stick in the fire-plough'
>

A Papuan Tip language, Minaveha, likewise uses a compound term for the upper frictioning
stick which includes the term for 'hand', _nima-kabi_ (_nima_ 'hand' + _kabi_ '?'). In at least two
places, Sissano (NNG) and Nakanai (MM), the upper fire stick is referred to by the term for
penis (_etin_ in Sissano, _huti_ in Nakanai), both reflexes of POc _*quti(n)_.

    Across the Oceanic region it is possible to find some variation in fire-making methods,
although we have no reconstructions for methods other than by fire-plough. Bing on the PNG
north coast and Mapos Buang in the Huon Gulf area (both NNG) offer evidence for a
method in which rattan or vine is sawn rapidly around a piece of wood:

__pre__
 NNG: Mapos Buang  vaŋkC rurŋ       'make a fire by the traditional method using a
                                     piece of rattan, sawing it back and forth around a
                                     piece of dry wood with a split in it, lying on a little
                                     pile of tinder'
 NNG: Bing         baŋ-baŋ          'fire-stick and vine'

Another north coast language, Gedaged, has a term, _wol_, referring to a bow string. Fire is
produced by pulling a bow string rapidly back and forth over a piece of wood. The action
implied may be the same as in Carolinian _bʷuru-bʷur_ 'make a fire by generating friction with
a traditional drill' (from POc _*buru_ 'bore a hole, drill' ; see Ch. 9, §4.2).



6.2.2 Firewood

   In addition to the general term POc _*kaiu_ 'wood, stick ', we can reconstruct a PEOc term
_*papia_, specifically for firewood. Note that an identical term is reconstructable for PEOc
(cognates in SES and Fiji) with the meaning 'cook in native oven' (§3.1).

  Green and Pawley (Ch. 3, §3.6) note a general term for fireplace or hearth, PMP _*dapuR_,
POc _*rapu(R)_, with a frequent secondary meaning, particularly in Oceania, of 'ashes'.
Compounding may be used to distinguish the fireplace as 'place of ashes'.

There is a second term, PAn _*qabu_, POc _*qapu_, with similar reference. Blust (ACD) comments:
"_*qabu_ is among the most widespread and stable morphemes in the Austronesian family. It
referred to ashes, and prototypically to the ashes in the fireplace (hence its recurrent replacement
of PMP *dapuR in the meaning 'hearth')."

6.2.5 Trivet

   We would expect to be able to reconstruct a term for a trivet, an arrangement of three
stones on which the cooking pot is placed, but no clear reflex of PMP _*dalikan_, 'trivet' 
(Blust 1986) has been found, in spite of the presence of terms for trivet in north-west Melanesia
and Fiji. For example:

__pre__
 Adm: Mussau              atu ko-tolu        'trivet' (lit. 'three stones')

6.2.6 Stone oven

   A far more soundly based reconstruction is POc _*qumun_ 'oven made with hot stones, cook
in a stone or earth oven', which has reflexes in every major Oceanic subgroup, together with
some external cognates.[2] However, archaeological evidence points to such ovens having
much greater antiquity in Near Oceania and Australia than in Southeast Asia 
(Allen, et al. 1989: 550-551; Horton 1994:380-381). The external cognates are therefore regarded as
possible borrowings, and a higher-level reconstruction is not proposed.

Chowning (1991: 55) argues that the gloss 'earth oven' is too restrictive, as raised ovens
(covered with leaves rather than earth) as well as pit ovens are common in Oceania.



6.2.7 Covering and uncovering an oven

   The usual implement for handling hot stones and food in the oven was tongs, probably a
bent or folded piece of cane or midrib of a coconut frond. Note that some terms have been

   Only certain kinds of stones are suitable for use in stone ovens. Although some terms for
these have been located, e.g. Sudest (PT) _ɣərumu_ 'cooking stones used for mumu', Sursurunga
(MM, New Ireland) _kor_ 'kind of black stone used for mumuing', no cognates are identifiable.



6.3 Cooking methods

   Lichtenberk quotes from Oliver (1989:49) who has this to say about traditional cooking in
Oceania: "Most cooking was by broiling, by boiling (where there were clay pots, which was
not everywhere), and by baking (which was done in earth-pit ovens containing heated stones.)"
Lichtenberk continues (p.270): "In some places, food is boiled not over fire but by means of
hot stones dropped into a wooden bowl that contains the food and some liquid. Food can also
be steamed. In baking and roasting, the food is often, though not necessarily, wrapped,
usually in leaves, sometimes in bark."

                                                                          Food preparation         151


   He has listed terms for a range of cooking methods, with a word of warning as to the
reliability of precision in English glosses ('roast', 'grill', 'broil', 'cook in fire' etc.). He writes
(p.273), "Even though more than one term for roasting may be reconstructable for POc, the
differences in the glosses for the witnesses most likely reflect differences in the English
backgrounds of the authors rather than differences in cooking methods."



6.3.1 Cooking in stone oven

   Lichtenberk also gives a reconstruction, _*biti_ 'cook with hot stones (either by baking in
stone oven, or by boiling by dropping hot stones into liquid)' (p.271), which he suggests may
be POc, although he points out that all cognates are from either Northwest or Southeast
Solomonic languages, and thus likely candidates for borrowing. We have opted here to label
his reconstruction PSS.

6.3.3 Piercing, pricking

   When food was roasted, instead of simply being placed in the fire, it may have been
skewered. The terms referring to skewering and skewers were also used to refer to testing
food by pricking to see whether it was done. (See PMP _*cukcuk_, _suksuk_ 'skewer', and POc
_*(su)su(k)_ 'anything used to pierce, prick, a skewer'; _*(su)suk-i-_ 'pierce, prick'; Ch. 4, §3.2.1
and Ch. 9, §4.1).


6.3.4 Boiling, steaming

    Two verbs are reconstructable for POc with the meaning 'boil'. The problem is that the
sources of data do not usually distinguish between boiling and steaming, both of which are
practised in Oceania, 'boil' being the usual gloss. The difference between boiling and steaming
lies in the amount of liquid used. For boiling, the food is (more or less) entirely covered with
the liquid; for steaming, only a small amount of liquid is used. If POc did have a lexical
distinction between the two processes, there is some evidence, albeit weak, that the verb for
'boil' was *nasu and that the one for 'steam' was *napu, It is also conceivable that of the two
terms, *nasu was unmarked and could be used to refer to both types of process.

It is possible that the forms attributed to PPT *na(q)u(q) 'clay dish' in Chapter 4, §2.1.5, are
also reflexes of *napu: see the discussion there.



6.3.5 Warming


   Lichtenberk contributes a POc term which he glosses as 'warm oneself by fire; warm up,
reheat (esp. food)' . Ann Chowning has added cognates from Kove, Molima and Nakanai
which, like the Pukapuka term, refer to heating of leaves in preparation for mat making (see
Chapter 4, §3.1.1).The POc gloss has been generalised accordingly.

6.3.7 Wrapping prior to oven-cooking

   Two similar terms for wrapping food for cooking (baking or roasting), POc _*kapu(t)_,
_*kaput-i-_ and POc _*kopu_, have been reconstructed. Mills (1981: 73) has proposed PMP
_*kaput_ 'close, cover', while Blust (1986:45) gives a gloss of 'tie or clasp together' for an
identical PMP reconstruction. Oceanic reflexes indicate two distinct terms, although there
may have been some blending of meaning in daughter languages. Lichtenberk suggests that
the two POc terms may have referred to different ways of wrapping food; Firth (1957), for
instance, gives four terms for different ways of wrapping food in Tikopia. From the glosses
below, it seems possible that _*kapu(t)_, _*kaput-i-_ referred to covering (as an earth oven is
covered), whilst *kopu referred to the wrapping of the food in bundles. For both terms,
reflexes indicate wider reference than to food alone. In Polynesia they have come to refer
more specifically to clothing or blankets.

6.3.8 Uncooked food

   Lichtenberk also considers terms for uncooked food. He proposes a general POc term
_*(a)mataq_ for raw food (possibly excluding certain foodstuffs) which also refers to unripe
foodstuff, such as fruit. Its reflexes in fact seem to reflect two forms, _*mataq_ and _*qa-mataq_,
the latter presumably derived from the former, but the function of _*qa-_ is unclear.

PAn/PMP _*maqataq_ evidently consisted of _*ma-_ 'anticausative' (Ch. 2, §3.1.2) + _qataq_ 'eat
something raw'. The POc reflex _*mataq_ shows irregular loss of medial _*-q-_. The unaffixed
base also survived in POc, and is reflected, with meanings similar to _*mataq_, in some
Oceanic languages.

6.4 Preserving

    Lichtenberk (p.277) records two main ways of preserving food in Oceania. One is drying,
either in the sun or above fire (the latter may involve smoking the food); the other is fermentation.

6.4.2 Fermentation

   Fermentation of food is geographically much more restricted. Small islands, particularly
atolls, are susceptible to food shortages as a result of drought or prolonged stormy weather
which makes fishing impossible, and have greater need for food reserves. Food fermentation
is practised primarily in those areas where sago is not available as a staple, the latter being
easily stored for lengthy periods of time. Assuming that sago was available as a foodstuff in
POc times (see Dutton 1994), Lichtenberk argues (p.278) that the nearly complementary
distribution of sago as a staple and fermented foodstuff suggests that the presence of
fermentation in Micronesia and Polynesia is due to independent developments. Also relevant,
however, is the fact that fermented breadfruit is regarded as one of the few foods suitable for
carrying on longer sea voyages, and thus a prime suspect, along with its term, for borrowing.
Yen (1975) writes that in Melanesia fermentation appears to be practised only in Santa Cruz
and ascribes its presence there to Polynesian influence. However, David Walsh has pointed
out (pers.comm. with Lichtenberk) that fermentation is practised also in some areas in Vanuatu.
(See the Namakir form mada below.) Ross (Food plants, vol. 3) points out that there is a
curious cross-over between the reflexes of PEOc _*mara_ 'preserved breadfruit' and POc
_*madraR_ 'grow ripe, overripe', _*madraR-i-_ 'grow ripe, overripe from (s.t.) (?)'. In scattered
languages in Vanuatu, Fiji and Micronesia, a reflex of _*madraR_/_*madraR-i-_ has taken over
the 'preserved breadfruit' sense which we would instead expect to find associated with a
reflex *mara. Since closely related languages both in Vanuatu and in Micronesia disagree as
to which term they reflect, Ross infers that the closeness of both form and meaning has led to
confusion between the two terms, leading to more than one independent occurrence of crossover.
POc *madraR seems to have been applied specifically to breadfruit and bananas, both of
which become soft and mushy when overripe. Breadfruit and bananas are also the two
foodstuffs which today are most commonly preserved by fermentation (Yen 1975). Chowning
lists a Nakanai cognate which indicates that the original POc term may have meant simply
'be spoiled (of food or drink)', with its meaning narrowing in Eastern Oceanic.

6.5 Food processing

6.5.1 Pounding

  We have terms for the action of pounding or crushing, but have been unable to reconstruct
any term for the implement or implements involved apart from PWOc _*walu_ 'sago beater'
and POc _*ike_ '(bark-cloth) beater' (for the latter, see Ch. 4, §S . l).

<
PWOc *walu 'sago beater' (Chowning 1991)
  NNG: Kove              walu
  PT:  Molima            (e)wanu           (_e-_ < PPT _*kai- INS)
  MM:  Nakanai           ualu
>

   Sago is pounded with an implement consisting of a head like a small adze, mounted on a
long handle (Ann Chowning pers.comm.). Smaller wooden pestles are used for mashing
foodstuffs like taro, banana and breadfruit, and for crushing nuts, particularly galip (Canarium)
and betel (Areca) nuts. Sometimes stones are used, or wooden pestles with stone heads.
Lithgow lists Muyuw (PT) kilakil 'stone-headed sago pounder', and Chowning (pers.comm.)
records a Nakanai (MM) term mulumu 'pestle of wood or bone used for crushing almonds or
areca nuts', from the verb mumu 'crush in a mortar'. Lichtenberk write (p.277) that:

|      Pounded foods are widespread in Oceania (Yen 1975). In Pidgin and in English they are
|      referred to as 'puddings' (although not all puddings require pounding). The usual main
|      ingredient is tubers (taro, yam), cooked and pounded, mashed into a paste together with
|      other ingredients such as coconut cream or nuts, and then usually recooked.

   A large wooden bowl (POc *tabiRa, PCP *kumete, see Ch. 4, §2.2.1) was traditionally
used as a mortar. Sago was pounded in a trough, stronger and hea vier than a bowl, and
designed so that water could run off from one end. Only isolated terms have been located
(Muyuw kas 'trough for sago-making'; Loniu _kupʷi_ 'trough in which sago is pounded').

                                                                      Food preparation        161

   As Blust (ACD) notes, terms dealing with the action of pounding frequently contain the
root _*-tuk_. A number of reconstructions have been made which evidently refer to hitting,
pounding, beating, breaking open, and so on, not just of foodstuffs, but with general application.
Cognate sets for the following reconstructions are included in Chapter 9, §5.1: POc _*tutuk_
'pound, mash by pounding, hammer, crack by hammering' (from PAn _*tuqtuq_); POc _*tuki-_
'pound'; POc _*putu(k)_ 'knock, pound, beat' (ACD) (from PMP _*buTuk_); and POc _*qatuŋ-i_
'strike from above, pound'.


6.5.2 Grating, scraping

   Foodstuffs such as tubers and coconut meat are often grated before further processing.
Tubers also need to be scraped to remove dirt. Both processes can be carried out with a shell
such as a cockle, and the scraper/grater may be referred to by its shell name. Scrapers and
graters are not always separately identified. The same implement may serve both functions,
just as the same verb may refer to both actions.

   Yet another reconstruction is POc _*asa(q)_ 'grate, sharpen by grating or rubbing' from PAn
_*Sasaq_ 'whet, sharpen' (see Ch. 4, §4.1.S).

   Lichtenberk comments (pp. 280-281) on the recurring sound symbolism evident in these
items, a feature which Blust has identified with PAn forms meaning 'rub, scrape, scratch'.
Terms with similar sound symbolism readily undergo conflation. Lichtenberk also refers to
the possibility that in POc or pre-POc times there was some kind of derivational relation
among at least some of the forms, noting that unlike the other forms, _*ko(r,R)as_ took as its
direct object a noun phrase referring to the stuff scraped off rather than the object being
scraped (e.g. the coconut meat rather than the coconut). (See also Ch. 9, §2.2.)

6.5.6 Straining

   The most common method of straining, necessary for processing such foodstuffs as sago
and coconut cream, and also used in the production of kava, is by using the fibrous spathe of
a coconut frond.

   Mic: Puluwat        wɒn             'coconut cloth'

   Pn:  Rennellese     gunu            'coconut fibre wringer'
>

Lichtenberk (1994) reconstructed PEOc _*unu(p)_ 'strainer, probably the fibrous spathe of a
coconut frond', but it is reasonably certain that the reflexes attributed thereto should be
combined with those above and attributed to _*Runut_/_*nuRut_ (Ross 1996d). Lichtenberk
reconstructed final _*-p_ on the basis of Mota (NCV) _unuv_ '(a fluid) sink in, be absorbed', but
we take this not to be cognate. As Geraghty (1990) points out, Sa'a (SES) shows irregular
loss of initial _*R-_, but Rennellese (pn) _gunu_, borrowed from a SES language, reflects Proto
SES _*lunu_ (< POc _*Runut_). Sa'a also shows loss of _*R_ in a few other items, so its loss here is
not completely surprising.

Another reconstruction, POc _*piri_ 'twist, wrap around', whose reflexes refer typically to the
manufacture of rope or twine (see Ch. 4, §3.2), has reflexes in some languages which refer to
extracting coconut milk by squeezing it through coconut fibre (MM: Kia _piriki_ 'wring, squeeze
coconut milk', NCV: Tamambo _viri_ 'twist, plait, braid; coconut milk'. See also SES: Arosi
_biri-yi_ 'squeeze coconut milk through fibre').

   Lichtenberk writes (p.283):

|    It is not possible to detennine fully what the distinctions were among the various terms for

|    _*losi_ took as their direct object a noun phrase referring to the object out of which liquid is
|    extracted, whereas _*poRos_ and _*pirik_ took as their direct object a noun phrase referring to
|    the liquid extracted. _*pipik_ and _*pisak_ referred to squeezing by pressing, while _*poji_ and
|    _*losi_ referred to squeezing by wringing. The item _*pirik_ referred specifically to a wringing
|    action, while *poRos may have been an unmarked term whose meaning subsumed both
|    pressing and wringing. (As Ann Chowning has pointed out [pers.comm.] there are two
|    basic ways used to extract coconut cream: wringing coconut gratings through coconut
|    'cloth', or squeezing them in one's hands.)

7 Canoes and seafaring

7.1 Introduction

7.1.1 Questions

   Between 3000 and 1000 BC, speakers of Austronesian languages spread across Island
Southeast Asia and western Melanesia and into the previously uninhabited islands of the
Central Pacific.[1] By about 1000 AD they had colonised the whole of Polynesia and Micronesia
and had settled Madagascar, more than half a world away.[2] This farflung maritime dispersal
of closely related peoples, without parallel in human history until the West European expansion
of the 15th-20th centuries AD, must have been based on a fairly efficient sailing technology.
What was this technology? When and where did it develop? To what extent was it modified
during the Austronesian diaspora?

   There is already an extensive literature on these questions, much of it by culture historians
who apply the typological comparative and distributional methods (discussed in §1.2) to
sailing craft and sailing techniques. Our contribution will be to see what light can be thrown
on these questions by comparing the vocabulary for watercraft and seafaring across the
Austronesian family, using the genetic comparative method of historical linguistics. We will
focus on the early phases of Austronesian expansion, that is, on cognate sets that probably go
back more than 2,000 years. Little will be said here about the complex developments in
boatbuilding which have taken place in Island Southeast Asia over the last couple of millenia,
well after the main Austronesian dispersal across and beyond this region, or about modifications
in the design of craft that according to Haddon and Hornell (Haddon 1937, Haddon & Hornell 1938,
Hornell 1936) have taken place in various regions of Oceania within the last
millenium. An exhaustive study of material relevant to reconstructing terms for vessel design
and seafaring at all stages in the history of the Austronesian family would take several years
and fill a very large book.


174     Andrew and Medina Pawley


[1] This is a slightly revised version of a paper which is included in Pawley and Ross, eds. 1994.
    Unlike other chapters in this volume, this chapter takes account of the Austronesian language family
    as a whole, rather than just of its Oceanic subgroup. We have done this because the topic of canoes
    and seafaring is, in an obvious way, intimately associated with the Austronesian dispersal, of which
    the Oceanic dispersal was simply the later part: to ignore the earlier part would be somewhat
    arbitrary. We are grateful to many colleagues for help. Robert Blust, Charles Grimes, Ric Jackson,
    Jeff Marck and Bernd Nothofer provided corrections to many points of detail as well as additional
    evidence. Sander Adelaar, Wal Ambrose, Mark Donohue, Paul Geraghty, Geoff Irwin, Alan Jones,
    Nigel Oram, Lawrence Reid and Malcolm Ross also offered valuable comments or data.

[2] See e.g. Shutler and Marck (1975), Bellwood (1978, 1988), Pawley and Green (1973, 1984),
    Spriggs (1984, 1989, 1990) for discussion of the dating of the Austronesian diaspora, using
    C14 dating of archaeological assemblages that can be associated with Austronesian speakers.


7.1.2 Reconstructions based on comparative typology: methodological problems

   Describing the sailing craft and navigation techniques in the Indo-Pacific region, and
theorising about their origins and development have been popular pastimes among Western
scholars since the first European explorers visited the region.[3] The fairly close correlation
between the distribution of outrigger canoes and that of the Austronesian language family
has not escaped the attention of culture historians.

   Those writers who have drawn conclusions about the nature of early Austronesian sailing
craft and navigation have generally relied on the 'typological comparative method' of historical
reconstruction. The typological method is a theory of structural types, making assumptions
about how structural features are linked in systems, what kinds of changes are possible or
likely, which types are logically prior to others, etc. The kinds of historical inferences this
method can give, when applied to a range of contemporary systems, are probabilistic ones:
for example, the inference that type X is more likely to have given rise to type Y than vice
versa. The typological method is often allied to a distributional one. The assumption is that
one can infer much about the antiquity of a given structural type or feature from its geographic
distribution. For instance, the observation that a certain complex of cultural features is found
among widely scattered peoples speaking related languages can be taken as evidence that the
complex was present in a common ancestral culture. On the other hand, if such a complex
has a more restricted but continuous geographic distribution it is likely to have been an
innovation that diffused over this region after the dispersal of the ancestral population.

   In his _Sailing Craft of Indonesia_ Adrian Horridge (1986:2-3) employs a distributional
argument when he writes:

|   The very wide distribution of their homogeneous cultural heritage shows that [the ancestral
|   Malayo-Polynesians][4] had an excellent knowledge of outrigger canoes for transporting fire,
|   family, pigs, chickens and dogs, not to mention dozens of useful plants, by sea.

   Other passages in the same book present some fairly detailed conclusions about the design
of the vessels. These are based partly on the logic of technology - what is possible and what is
likely in the development of techniques, given certain equipment and natural resources,
engineering knowledge, navigational knowledge, climatic conditions, etc. - and partly on
distributional grounds.


                                                                     Canoes and seafaring              175

|   The signs are that the original Malayo-Polynesian rig was a two-boom triangular sail fixed
|   by the point (tack) in the bows of the boat and held up by a loose prop, with a rope to the
|   outriggers to prevent it falling sideways. (p.56)

|        All Malayo-Polynesian rigs therefore had the fundamental property that the sail could be
|   tilted fore and aft to balance the sail with reference to the balance of the hull and load on the
|   steering paddle. In principle they could all be steered like a windsurfer, simply by tilting the
|   sail fore and aft. These rigs, like the outrigger canoes for which they were adapted, were
|   invented in Island South-East Asia, and spread with the Malayo-Polynesian expansion,
|   although they may have been known in Indonesia before that time. (p.58)

|        The idea of a boat built from sewn planks was known to the Polynesian migrants into
|   the Pacific, and perhaps came from mainland Asia before 5000 Be, but the idea of fixing
|   the planks edge-to-edge with dowels seems to have spread later from the mainland, with the
|   same distribution as the use of metal for boat-building tools … All the techniques needed to
|   make a lashed-lug boat, sewn of course, were known to the earliest Polynesians, and the
|   projecting lugs carved in situ are a feature of many traditional Polynesian, Micronesian and
|   Melanesian boats. (pp.57-58)

In the following passage, Horridge combines structural and distributional arguments with
archaeological evidence:

|   The earliest evidence of trading by boats that could beat against the wind is provided by
|   pottery with a particular design, known as Lapita, that spread rapidly from Western Melanesia
|   far into what is now Polynesia about 3000 years ago. The vessels carrying the potters were
|   probably double canoes because nothing else in the region is sufficiently seaworthy. (p.4)

   The strength of technology-based comparative studies is in the detailed historical inferences
concerning design and construction which they yield. That is not to say such inferences are
necessarily reliable. There are some serious methodological weaknesses associated with all
reconstructions based purely on the logic of types and the distributional method.

   Because innovations in material culture sometimes spread and replace older usages and
because some innovations are made independently in different places, the widespread geographic
distribution of a feature or even a complex of features does not guarantee its great antiquity.
Nor does the restricted distribution of a feature guarantee that it is a recent innovation. The
method of comparative typology is unable to distinguish in a reliable way between 'inherited'
and 'borrowed' elements or features within a continuing community or cultural tradition, that
is, between institutions which have been handed down from generation to generation within
the community or tradition since a given point in time, and institutions that have entered the
tradition from outside since that point in time. The method is also unable to distinguish
reliably between 'retentions' and 'innovations' within the same tradition, that is, between
features that have been part of a tradition since a given point in time and those that were
developed later.

   In Indonesia and contiguous regions of Island Southeast Asia the problems of distinguishing
retentions, innovations and borrowings in sailing technology are particularly acute. There, the
local sailing traditions of Austronesian-speaking communities have not only diversified and
influenced one another but have been exposed to numerous alien traditions coming from
mainland Asia. Horridge acknowledges this point:

|   The Malayo-Polynesians diversified as they spread, and from them are descended the
|   specialized boat-building and boat-loving maritime groups of Indonesia, namely the Bajau
|   or Sea Gypsies, the Buginese from the Gulf of Bone, the Makassarese, the Mandar people
|   from West Sulawesi, and the Butungese from South-east Sulawesi, and the Madurese … [and]
|   the fishennen of the islands of Bawean, Masalembu and Sepudi in the Java Sea, the traders
|   of Bonerate and Pulau Palu'e in the Flores Sea, the whalers of Lamalerap on Lomblen in the
|   Timor Straits, the men of Luang in the Barat Daya Islands, and the numerous Buginese
|   colonies which control a wide network of trade in miscellaneous goods. All these very
|   diverse groups have inherited the Malayo-Polynesian seafaring tradition, and methods of
|   building outrigger canoes which over the past two millenia have been mixed with traditions
|  from the Indian Ocean and the West to give the modern hatch-patch of boat and canoe
|  styles. (pp.3-4) [our italics: AP & MP.]

176   A ndrew and Medina Pawley

   Horridge's remarks remind us that the testimony of central Pacific cultures is likely to be
crucial in reconstructing early Austronesian sailing technology. The relative isolation of the
peoples of the more remote Pacific islands may have allowed some of them to continue the
early Austronesian sailing culture with fewer changes than most peoples in Island Southeast
Asia.

   A problem arises when students of comparative technology dabble in comparative linguistics
without underpinning them by the careful studies of sound correspondences and subgroupings
needed to distinguish between cognates, accidental resemblances and borrowings or to determine
the relative chronology of linguistic innovations. The results of such dabblings will be largely
worthless. Haddon and Hornell's (Haddon 1937, Haddon & Hornell 1938, Hornell 1936)
admirable survey, Canoes of Oceania, is marred by a number of fanciful historical speculations
which rest in part on naive readings of linguistic similarities. To a much larger extent,
however, their fanciful historical inferences rest on a diffusionist interpretation of the
comparative material culture, uninformed by systematic study of comparative vocabulary or
by archaeological evidence.

[3]  Among the scores of 20th century works on these subjects are Best (1923, 1925), Doran (1981),
Finney (1979), Friederici (1933), Gladwin (1970), Golson (1972), Haddon (1937),
Haddon and Hornell (1938), Hornell (1936), Horridge (1978, 1981, 1986), Hutchins (1983),
Irwin (1989, 1992), Lewis (1972), Sharp (1956), Siers (1977), Thomas (1987).

[4] Horridge recognizes the distinction that linguists now usually make between 'Austronesian', as the
    name of the entire language family, and 'Malayo-Polynesian', as the name for a putative subgroup
    that includes all Austronesian languages except those of Formosa.


7.1.3 The Genetic Comparative Method

   There is a means of escape from the limitations of comparative typology. It is the special
virtue of the comparative or genetic method of historical linguistics that it can, in principle,
(a) define genetic continuity in certain parts of the vocabulary of each language in a language
family, distinguishing resemblances due to common origin from resemblances due to borrowing,
and (b) assign a relative chronology to innovations occurring within the languages of a
linguistic family.[5]

    However, linguists need not feel unduly smug about the genetic comparative method. It
applies only to a restricted part of each language-culture system, namely the stock of morphemes
that have cognates in genetically related languages. Often it happens that linguistics is silent
in the face of competing hypotheses derived from comparative technology, say, about techniques
of manufacture, because no distinctive terms can be reconstructed for the technological
elements in question. And while the genetic method often allows us to make strong inferences
about the presence of some things in a reconstructed language-culture system, it does not tell
us what was absent. That is to say, our inability to reconstruct a term for a particular element
in protolanguage L is not conclusive proof that speakers of L lacked a term for that element.
Within these limitations, the genetic comparative method remains a powerful tool.

[5] It should be stressed that the genetic comparative method is not a discovery procedure that
    automatically yields correct interpretations of linguistic comparisons. There are invariably
    ambiguities in the evidence that require choice between two or more hypotheses. The method works
    best when (a) the number of putative cognate sets is large, (b) the witnesses (languages compared)
    have had little or no contact for a long time, (c) the number of such independent witnesses in
    the family is large, (d) the witnesses at each level fall into more than two subgroups.

                                                                          Canoes and seafaring    177


7.1.4 Lexical sources

     Many previous publications isolate Austronesian cognate sets referring to canoe parts and
seafaring. However, works compiled by linguists only list such cognate sets as isolated items
within a larger body of semantically unordered material. This chapter draws together published
comparisons and extends them. Sources giving relevant cognate sets or sound correspondences
relevant to determining cognation include Bender et al (1983), Biggs (1978, 1993),[6]
Blust (1970, 1972b, 1976a, 1978a, 1978b, 1980b, 1983-84a, 1986, 1989), Clark (1994),
Collins (1983), Dahl (1973), Dempwolff (1938), Ferrell (1969), Geraghty (1983), Jackson (1983),
Milke (1961, 1968), Pallesen (1985), Pawley (1972), Reid (1971), Ross (1988), Sneddon (1984)
and Tryon (1976). We have also consulted dictionaries of many contemporary languages.

[6]   The version of POLLEX (= Biggs 1993) used here, in fact, dates from 1990.


7.1.5 Organisation of reconstructions and cognate sets

     Some fifty cognate sets will be discussed. These are ordered by semantic domains, such as
type of vessel, beginning with types of vessels and hull construction and going on to outrigger
structure, superstructure, sail and rigging, accessories, launching, beaching and anchoring
and ending with terms for seafaring and seafarers.

     Each reconstructed word or etymon is attributed to a certain level of the Austronesian
family tree, the highest level justified by the distribution of the cognate set across subgroups.
Below it are listed the cognates from contemporary languages. These are ordered according
to subgroup, usually proceeding roughly in a west to east direction, e.g. Western Malayo-Polynesian
cognates precede CMP cognates which in turn precede Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
cognates. As well as giving the highest-level reconstruction we often give intermediate-level
reconstructions for named interstages, especially when the the interstage reconstruction differs
significantly in form or meaning from the highest-order reconstruction. When listing cognates
we occasionally acknowledge sources when the evidence comes from Haddon (1937), Hornell (1936)
or Haddon and and Hornell (1938) or a source other than a published dictionary.


7.2 Types of vessel and hull construction

7.2.1 Types of vessel

   Haddon and Hornell (1938: 70-72) referred to ten or so putative cognate sets having the
general sense of 'canoe' or 'boat' that go back to an early stage or stages of Austronesian.
While early Austronesian speakers probably had several different named types of craft, most
of Haddon and Hornell's etymologies are false. Only one of their putative cognate sets can be
attributed to an early Austronesian interstage-that pointing to PCEMP _*waŋka_, POc _*waga_.

178      Andrew and Medina Pawley

   POc _*waga_ (phonetically [waŋga] with [ŋg] being a single phoneme) is widely reflected
within Oceanic as a general term for a canoe or boat with a hull, as opposed to a raft. In
many Oceanic languages, however, the reflex of _*waga_ refers chiefly to large sailing canoes
and other large vessels, in contrast to dugout canoes and small outrigger canoes. This range
of meanings, taken together with the cognate set under PMP _*katiR_, suggests that _*waga_
may have had two senses in POco

The primary sense of POc _*waga_ was perhaps 'large sailing canoe' in contrast to paddling
canoes (dugouts and small outrigger canoes). This sense is widely reflected across subgroups
of Oceanic. As the name of the largest and most prestigious type, *waga would have been a
natural choice as a generic term for all types of canoe and in a number of languages the
generic sense has become primary. An example is from Kilivila, the language of the Kiriwina
people of the Trobriand Islands (reported by Haddon (1937:267-269), based on Malinowski
(1922) and correspondence with Malinowski). In Kiriwina there are four named types of
canoes. The _kewoʔu_ is a simple dugout with outrigger, used in the lagoon. The _kalipoulo_, a
fishing canoe, is a larger dugout with several designs. These have in common a hull built up
with a washstrake on each side, and transverse carved and painted breakwaters, and the hull
usually has pointed ends, carved and painted. There is often a platform over the booms. The
sail is a lateen. The _masawa_ is a large trading canoe, similarly constructed to the _kalipoulo_
but with two clinker-built washstrakes on each side and twenty or more booms covered by a
continuous platform. It carries a large, elongated steering oar worked by two men. The
_nagega_ is larger and more seaworthy than the _masawa_, with higher sides and more carrying
capacity and a central standing mast, as opposed to a leaning mast stepped within the hull
and shored by a prop. The generic term for all these craft is waga. In another part of Papua,
around Samarai, Abel (1902:62) reports that _vaga_ is the generic for all kinds of sailing
canoes, but evidently excluded canoes without outriggers or sails.

   Although the forms in the above two sets show a striking resemblance to POc _*waga_, they
are not demonstrably cognate. In the first set, initial _w-_ is irregular, suggesting that these are
borrowed words, though the source of the borrowing is unclear (Alexander Adelaar,
pers.comm.). In the second set, the uncharacteristic occurrence of the cluster _ŋk_ in the Philippine
and Formosan forms suggests borrowing from a Malayo-Javanic or Sulawesi source (Lawrence
Reid, pers.comm.). Tagalog and Cebuano b are not the regular reflexes of PMP _*w_. At
present, most of the few coastal Austronesian-speaking communities left on Taiwan proper
use large bamboo sailing rafts for fishing. However, there is evidence that in the nineteenth
century other kinds of craft including double outriggers were in use. Scott (1982:337) cites
an eighteenth century Chinese observer, Huang Shi-ching, describing a built-up dugout canoe
called a _manka_ [or _banka_] as follows:

|   A manka is a single tree trunk hollowed out, with wooden planks fastened on both sides
|   with rattans; since they have no putty for caulking and water easily enters, the barbarians
|   keep baling with a ladle.

It is likely (Mark Donohue, pers.comm.) that the Chinese characters in question are from the
Hokkien dialect and should be read as _banka_, not _manka_ as reported by Scott. The form
_*ba(ŋ)ka_ is however reflected both in CMP and Oceanic, and must be attributed to their
common ancestor, which Blust (1993) labels PCEMP.

    The next term is reconstructable as far back as PMP. But note the disagreement between
WMP and Oceanic witnesses as to its meaning.

   Although the WMP cognates denote 'outrigger float', there is a much stronger candidate
for that meaning in PMP, namely _*(c,s)a(R)man_ (§4.1). Therefore we conclude that _*katiR_ is
unlikely to have meant 'outrigger float' in PMP and that the WMP cognates probably show
semantic change. In Oceanic, reflexes of _*katiR_ are confined to Western Oceanic but are
widely dispersed within that large group. The Western Oceanic comparisons strongly point to
an earlier meaning such as 'canoe hull' or 'small outrigger canoe'.

Evidence for the reconstruction occurs in two geographically separated primary subgroups of
Oceanic, but apparently nowhere else. Despite this distribution, the evidence would be clear
enough, were it not for (i) the meaning of the Proto Southeast Solomonic term, reconstructable
as 'plank-built canoe', and (ii) the fact that the Lau, Baegu, Kwai and Arosi reflexes could
well reflect, not _*tola_, but POc _*(q)oRa_ 'strake, probably topstrake (washstrake) (§2.4)
(Cristobal-Malaitan languages regularly lose POc _*t_). It is possible that the forms _ola_/_ora_
reflect a falling together of _*tola_ and _*(q)oRa_, the meaning narrowing in favour of _*(q)oRa_
and then transferred to Bugotu, Gela _tola_.

   Evidence from other Southeast Solomonic languages further confuses the issue. Gela and
Tolo (Guadalcanal) _tiola_ 'generic term for plank-built canoes' and 'Are'are _iora_, Sa'a _iola_
'plank-built canoe' might be explained as deriving from a bimorphemic form _*ti-(q)oRa_.
This might be liable to conflation with reflexes of _*tola_ also.

7.2.2 Double canoes

   It has been suggested (Roger Green, pers.comm.) that the ocean-going double-hulled canoe
was an innovation of Oceanic speakers. He argues that it was large double canoes, stable and
able to carry big loads while being sailed with traditional rig, that were the key to the
transport of people, crops and domestic animals to the far-flung islands of Remote Oceania
(the Pacific islands east and north of the New Guinea area, the Bismarck Archipelago and the
main Solomon Islands chain).[8] The design of double canoes varied in some details from place
to place but the main structure consisted of two dugout hulls, placed parallel and usually one
to two metres apart, joined by booms, with a platform built amidships. In the most efficient
craft, represented by the Fijian _drua_, one hull was slightly smaller than the other. At the time
of first European contact such craft were almost wholly confined to Remote Oceania, being
present in New Caledonia and Fiji, in many parts of Polynesia and in a restricted region of
the central Caroline Islands. In western Melanesia double canoes were made by the Mailu, of
south-east coast Papua. The Mailu speak a non-Austronesian language but many of their
canoe terms (and other parts of their vocabulary) are from Austronesian; it seems likely that
the population of the Mailu area was once largely Austronesian-speaking. The Motu _laɣatoi_,
a multi-hulled craft, can be derived from the double canoe.

   No term for double canoe can safely be reconstructed for any very early Austronesian
interstage. However, a number of Oceanic languages reflect the following form:

[8] See Pawley and Green (1973), Green (1991 b) for the terms 'Near Oceania' and 'Remote Oceania'.

>

[9] _b_ for expected _p_, possibly borrowed from a Polynesian source.

[10] Obsolete (Hornell 1936:302).

 PEOc _*paqurua_ is a compound formed from POc _*paqu(s)_ 'bind, lash; construct by tying
together' (Ch. 9, § 10) and _*rua_ 'two'. While it is possible that Lau _foorua_ is borrowed from
a Polynesian language, the details of form do not support this notion. Lau has the independent
bases _foo_ 'bind' and _rua_ 'two'. Haddon (1937: 77) reports Kinilaulau (Carteret Islands)
_haulau_, _holua_ 'outrigger canoe ', but this term is probably borrowed from a Polynesian
language believed to have been formerly spoken on the island or from nearby Takuu.

    Friederici (1928:31) suggests that the double canoe of Oceania (or at least the type with
smaller and finer-pointed port hull) originated from a canoe with a single outrigger, on the
grounds that (a) in the double canoes of Polynesia and Fiji one of the two hulls is usually
smaller, the smaller hull being called by the term for the outrigger float (e.g. _hama_ in
Tongan), and (b) the connecting poles between the hulls are also called by the word for the
outrigger booms (_kiato_ in Tongan). On the other hand, Haddon and Hornell (1938: 43) argue
that the most likely origin of the double canoe is from two dugouts lashed together or a short
distance apart. They also note the possibility that the single outrigger canoe may ultimately be
derived from the double canoe by reducing the port hull to form a float. As the smaller hull
and the float and the connecting poles serve the same purpose in both types of vessels, the
extension of terms seen in Tongan _hama_ and _hato_ is natural. On logical grounds alone it is
hard to choose between these historical interpretations. And in this case the linguistic evidence
is relatively unhelpful.

    Numerous other reconstructions, attributable to interstages lower than PMP or POc, can
be made for types of craft. For example, the following doublets (distinct words coexisting in
a language whose similar form and meaning suggest they ultimately trace back to the same
source) can be reconstructed:

These forms have sometimes been compared with Oceanic forms represented by Tongan
_folau_ 'voyage, travel by sea', Fijian _volau_ 'boat shed' (cf. _*pa-laSud_, §9.2).
   A PPn reconstruction for a small canoe used close to shore is well supported:

<

  Pn: Tongan          pōpao              'roughly made dugout canoe with two boom outrigger'

  Pn: Tikopia         paopao             (1) 'craft made from log simply hollowed out, not built up'; (2) 'canoe, sea-going but not sacralised, in contrast to vaka tapu'
  Pn: Nukuoro         paopao             'double-ended single outrigger with two booms'
>

A possible cognate occurs in a single Western Oceanic language, Mekeo of the Central
Province of Papua. East Mekeo has _papao_ (dialect _fafao_) 'small canoe for children, also
used as a trough for feeding pigs'. Reduction of the first vowel cluster of a reduplicated word
is characteristic of Mekeo (Alan Jones, pers.comm.). This comparison points to POc _*paopao_
'small outrigger canoe', though it needs strengthening by further cognates beyond Polynesian.

    Blust (1986:33) reconstructs the term _*dakit_, noting a number of reflexes within the
WMP region and a regular reflex in one Oceanic language, Motu. To these may be added
many other Philippine and Northern Sulawesi reflexes (given in Reid 1971) and possible
reflexes in CMP and Western Oceanic.

7.2.3 Hull construction

   In pre-European times three basic hull designs were found in Austronesian-speaking
communities: (a) a dugout built from a single log; (b) a five-part canoe, composed of dug-out
hull, with the sides raised by sewing one side piece or strake to each side, with forked,
crutch-shaped pieces at each end; and (c) a built-up canoe, in which a number of planks or
strakes are added to a keel. The keel may consist of a thick plank or a dugout underbody (or
sometimes two or even three dugouts joined).

   Ethnologists have argued on logical grounds that types (b) and (c) developed from the
dugout prototype. In his account of Philippine boat-building in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Scott (1982: 337-338) sketches a theory of the evolution of the hull of Philippine
boats:

|   In the ship-building technique [developed in China and Europe in the Middle Ages] … a rigid
|   framework of keel and ribs is first constructed … and the wooden planking of the hull then
|   nailed to it with metal spikes or wooden trenails. The older technique was to build the hull
|   first, plank by plank carved to fit, and to fasten the ribs in afterwards. This technique is
|   probably a natural development of the one-log dugout canoe by adding one board to each
|   side to obtain higher freeboard.

|        By increasing the number of such additional planks, a fully developed boat or ship is
|    produced. But as the sides of the canoe, or banca, are thinned, some transverse strengthening
|   is required, and this can be provided by running strut-like thwarts across the vessel, securing
|   them to the sides without nails by means of tambukos [lugs] and lashing. For this purpose a
|   flexible rib can be pressed down across all of them and lashed securely to the matching
|   tambukos carved on each plank. Finally a combination of such thwarts and ribs lashed
|   together … produces a sturdy vessel whose hull and other structural parts are held firm under
|   prestressed tension.

   The question arises as to whether any or all of these features of hull design are attested in
the vocabulary of PMP and other interstages.


7.2.4 Planking

   The comparisons below and in §2.5point to the use by speakers of PMP and its immediate
descendants, of boats built up by planking and strengthened by thwarts:

>

 PMP _*papan_ evidently referred to any plank or board (see Ch. 3, §3. S). It might be argued
that this term could have been independently applied to canoe strakes or planks by different
daughter languages after the break-up of PMP. However, the fact that in diverse Malayo-Polynesian
languages reflexes of _*papan_ are consistently used of canoe planks, even in cases
when another general word for plank or board has developed, is a fairly strong indication that
this application goes back to PMP times.

Possible cognates of _*(q)oRa_ occur in Cristobal-Malaitan languages of the Southeast Solomonic
family: Arosi ora, Lau ola 'plank-built canoe (built up from a plank centre keel, with bow
and stern keels), with no outrigger'. As noted in §2.1, however, their interpretation is difficult,
as they could also reflect POc _*tola_ 'large canoe'.

    The question of how planks were joined is connected to the question of whether early
Austronesian communities used stone or metal tools, as the following remarks by Scott (1982:338-339)
make clear:

|   Historically there are two methods by which the planks in [Philippine] plank-built boats are
|   fastened together - sewing and edge-pegging. Sewing - or, better said, lacing - the
|   boards together is done by drilling a matching row of holes through the two boards near
|   their adjoining edges, and running rattan strips through them in the manner of lacing up a
|   shoe or basketball. This is the older technique and it can be performed with even a simple
|   stone or bone drill, as was still being done in remote Pacific islands … Stone tools are
|   probably inadequate for drilling deep holes in the thin edges of boards, and it is therefore
|   not surprising that edge-pegging does not appear in those distant Pacific islands whose
|   inhabitants presumably migrated there without metal.

                                                                            Canoes and seafaring             187

   We can reconstruct PMP _*kiRam_ 'adze/axe' and _*taRaqi_ (V) 'adze, carve' (Ch. 4, §4.1.1),
with reflexes in Oceanic as well as in WMP witnesses, but there are no secure PMP or POc
reconstructions for other equipment likely to have been used in boat-building.[11] The current
consensus among archaeologists is that the introduction of metal in eastern Asia postdated
the break-up of PAn and PMP. Although Blust (1976b) has pointed to comparisons between
Formosan and WMP forms suggesting that PAn speakers may have had a knowledge of
metal tools, it is likely that this knowledge spread after the break-up of PAn and PMP.

[11]  The fruit of the putty nut (Parinarium laurinum) is widely used to caulk or stop a vessel.
      In Proto Huon Gulf an identical term is reconstructable both for the nut and the glue that is
      made from it: Proto Huon Gulf _*jimiR_ 'putty nut, caulking substance' (Ross 1988:79);
      Tami _jim_ 'caulking substance'; Tuam _zimir_ 'caulk'; Numbami _dimil-a_ 'caulk'.
      The following set is of uncertain relation to _*jimiR_: POc _*jema_ 'caulk' (Milke 1968):
      Motu _dema-ia_ 'caulk'; E. Fijian _sema_ 'splice, join, patch', _sema-ta_ 'to splice, join, patch s.t.'

7.2.6 Underbody, keel


   There is no well-supported PMP reconstruction for 'dugout underbody of canoe (to which
planking is added)' or for 'keel of built-up canoe' although _*ba(ŋ)ka(q)_ (§2.1) is a candidate
for the former. Such a term is, however, clearly reconstructable for PCP:

7.2.7 Bilge, interior of hull

   A PPn term for 'bilge, interior of hull' is well supported but cognates have not been noted
elsewhere. In some Polynesian languages the same term refers to the interior of any container,
such as a cup or basket.

7.2.8 Bow and stern

   Two well-attested POc locative nouns having the general sense of 'rear, back part', and
'front, front part', respectively, are reconstructable also with the specialised senses 'stern' and
'bow'. The first of these terms goes back at least to PMP.

7.2.9 Carved projecting end-pieces


Figure 25: POc _*ijuŋ_ 'projecting headboard of prow' (from Nevermann 1934:285)

   In many regions of Oceania larger canoes are constructed with a projecting headboard,
part of it resting on the underbody abutting the washstrake, the rest sometimes extending
several feet beyond. The end of such headboards usually consists of an elaborately carved
figurehead, often a human or animal head or figure. There is a corresponding carved end-board
at the stern, often standing more or less vertical. Such carved end-pieces are common, for
example, in eastern Polynesia, the Solomon Islands, the Massim, the north coast of New
Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago. A POc reconstruction can be made for the name of
the headboard:

<

  MM:  Roviana     ŋuzu-ŋuzu          'figurehead of a tomoko war canoe'
>

FIXME: From vol2: In vol. 1, p.189 the form POc _*ijuŋ_ ‘projecting headboard of prow’ is erroneously given for *(i,u)cuŋ. This is almost certainly the same etymon as that reconstructed here.

The central meaning of POc _*ijuŋ_ was 'nose' and that of _*ŋuju_ 'beak, snout, mouth'. Reflexes
of both commonly have the extended sense 'projecting point'. The conjunction of Southeast
Solomonic and Polynesian evidence suggests _*ijuŋ_ as the more likely POc form carrying the
sense 'projecting headboard'. No widespread cognate set for the stempiece has been noted.

[13]   Also called _tau ihu_ vs _tau rapa_ 'carved ornament on stern'.

7.2.10 Bow and stern covers, end-decking

   While outrigger canoes with simple dugout hull are suitable for inshore sailing, seaworthy
canoes require at least 'end-decking', minimally a V-shaped piece covering the bow and stern
of the dugout hull. The next comparison points to a PCP term for this piece; PCP _*tau_ may
come from POc _*taRu_ 'cover up':

<

  Fij: Rotuman       fau              (V) 'cover'; (N) 'cover'

Rick Jackson (pers.comm.) suggests Proto Trukic _*tau_ (?) 'thwart, cross-seat in canoe' based
on Carolinian, Trukese _sō_, Puluwat _ho_ 'thwart' . The above Polynesian comparisons also
indicate PPn _*tau-muʔa_ 'foredeck' and _*tau-muri_ 'afterdeck'.


7.3. Superstructure

7.3.1 Platform

   On medium-sized and large canoes a platform is sometimes built over the hull and the
outrigger (or between the two bulls on double canoes); or two platforms are built, one on the
outrigger and one on the starboard side. No PMP term for such a platform is reconstructable
on present evidence but there is a strong candidate for a POc term, namely:

<
PMP *pa(n)tar 'shelf; bed-frame of wooden or bamboo laths' (Blust 1980b: 123)
POc *patar 'platform of any kind, including that erected over hull and outrigger framework' (cf Ch. 3, §3.5)

7.3.2 Cabin, deck hut

   A deck hut is often added to large outrigger canoes but no widespread cognate set distinctively
denoting such a structure has so far been noted. In a number of languages, reflexes of PMP
_*balay_, POc _*pale_ 'hut, shed, open-sided house' (Ch. 3, §3.3) are used for a deck hut, for
example, Fijian _vale waqa_ (lit. 'canoe house'), and _valevale_ 'hut' (Hornell 1936:323), and
this may also have been the case in POco


7.4. Outrigger structure

7.4.1 Outrigger float, outrigger side of canoe

   The meaning 'outrigger float' can be attributed to PMP _*(c,s)a(R)man_. This term is well
attested in Oceanic and Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but rare in WMP. In many
WMP languages it has been replaced in this meaning by a reflex of _*katiR_ (§2.1). In Oceanic
languages the reflex of POc _*saman_ also has the sense of 'outrigger side of the canoe' in
contrast to _*katae_ 'free side of canoe' (§4.4).

Oceanic languages of the Papuan Tip subgroup reflect _*sarima_ rather than _*saman_ (e.g.
Motu _darima_, Suau (Daui) _salima_, Dobu _salime_, Molima _salima_). The _*sarima_ forms possibly
continue PMP _*(c,s)a(R)man_ with irregular insertion of i. A similar insertion occurs in the
PMP verbal prefix _*paR-_, continued as POc _*paRi-_.[15]

[14] Gloss dubious. Probably should be 'outrigger float'.

[15] See Pawley (1973: 172).

192        Andrew and Medina Pawley


7.4.2 Outrigger booms

   The outrigger float is connected to the hull by booms, two or three in the case of small
canoes but often five or more in larger, ocean-going canoes. A term for 'outrigger boom' can
be constructed for POc but not for PMP:

<
POc *kiajo 'outrigger boom'
     Adm: Mussau               iaro
     Adm: Loniu                kiec

     PT:  Kilivila             kiaro
     PT:  Aroma                iaro              'sticks connecting floats to boom' (Haddon)
     NCV: Nguna                kiato             'outrigger boom' (prob. Pn borrowing)
     Mic: Kiribatese           kiaro

     Pn:  Rennellese           kiato
     Pn:  Samoan               ʔiato
>

Fijian _i-kaso_ 'outrigger boom' (zero for _*i_ irregular) has sometimes been included in this set,
but probably belongs to a separate set, along with such forms as Mota gaso 'rafter', Lau _ʔato_
'rafter', which derive from a well-established etymon PMP *kasaw, POc _*kaso_ 'rafter'
(Ch. 3, §3.4). However, the comparison with Lau _ato_ 'outrigger boom' suggests that POc
_*kaso_ probably had the general meaning 'connecting beam or brace', and as well as denoting
crossbeams in a house may have been used as a synonym of _*kiajo_.

                                                                      Canoes and seafaring         193


7.4.3 Connective sticks attaching float

     Three main methods of connecting the outrigger float to the booms can be distinguished:
direct attachment, in which all of the booms are curved and lashed directly to the outrigger;
indirect attachment, in which all of the booms are lashed to sticks that are implanted in or
lashed to the float; and mixed attachment, in which some booms are attached directly and
others indirectly. A great diversity of methods of indirect attachment is found.

     A POc reconstruction for the connective sticks (stanchions, struts) was made by
Milke (1968) and is well attested. A single cognate in the north-west New Guinea language, Numfor,
allows tentative attribution of this etymon (with indeterminate final vowel) to Proto Eastern
Malayo-Polynesian.

7.4.4 Starboard or hull side of outrigger canoe

    A POc term can be reconstructed with the sense 'starboard or free side of the canoe,
opposite the outrigger side (_*saman_). In Central Pacific languages this term was also applied
to the larger hull of a double canoe.

<
POc *katae, *katea [16] 'free side of canoe, opposite the outrigger'

  Pn:  Samoan         atea               'hull side of a canoe, as opposed to the ama'
  Pn:  Tikopia        katea
  Pn:  Hawaiian       ʔakea              'starboard hull of double canoe'
>

No non-Oceanic cognates of this set are known.

[16] Paul Geraghty (pers.comm.) argues that the POc form was _*katae_, and that the form _*katea_
is a PPn innovation which has been borrowed by a few other languages.

7.5. Sail and rigging

    The characteristic Oceanic sail types are: (a) a triangular sprit sail with apex downwards
and a spar along each of the two sides stemming from the apex, and (b) the (crab) claw
sail-a triangular sail with the foreside fixed to a vertical mast and the afterside to a strongly
curved sprit, whose lower end is attached to the foot of the mast. In Indonesia a number of
other types of sail are found. Both fixed masts and moveable masts or props are used in
Indonesia and in the Pacific Islands. The pole is stepped in a socket or on a thwart amidships
and can be rotated and raked towards either end by means of running stays.

    We give here a further quote from Horridge (1986:56-57):

|   It is my belief, based on distribution, comparative vocabularies and engineering principles,
|   that the fixed mast with a halyard spread into Malayo-Polynesian communities from the
|   Indian Ocean along with the introduction of the pulley. A large sail of matting could not be
|   raised at sea without a pulley unless it was pushed up by a loose pole. There are no signs
|   that even the last Austronesian-speaking migrants to move out into the Pacific knew about
|   the tripod mast, the tilted rectangular sail, the pulley or the quarter rudder lashed to a rudder
|   support. All of these features also spread only a little way up the mainland coast towards
|   China … The tilted rectangular sail seems to have spread from the Indian Ocean, perhaps
|   even from … Egypt, and to have arrived in Indonesia about 2,000 years ago … It has spread
|   eastwards about as far as the quarter rudder and the pulley.

On some of these points the linguistic evidence appears to be silent. However, several terms
for parts of the rig are attributable to POc or to later interstages of Oceanic:

    Traditional Oceanic sails are made of matting, woven from pandanus leaves or other plant
fibres. It is therefore not surprising to find that reflexes of POc _*qebal_ 'pandanus mat' also
have the meaning 'sail' in a few languages. Given that POc _*layaR_ 'sail' is well established, it
is likely that _*qebal_ independently acquired the sense 'sail' in more than one daughter language.
For the cognate set, see Ch. 4, §3.1.

7.5.2 Boom and yard of sail

   The following form is well attested though its reflexes show a range of meanings:

  Adm: Seimat         sil
  Adm: Seimat         sil                'booms of triangular sail' (Haddon)

  Pn:  Samoan         tila               (1) 'sprit or spar of sail' (_tila lalo_ 'lower sprit' vs _tila tu_ 'yard, upper sprit'); (2) 'mast'

  Pn:  Maori          |tira (tū)|        'yard of sail, upper sprit'
>

 POc or PCP _*jila_ has commonly (e.g. Blust 1976a, Geraghty 1986, Ross 1988) been glossed
'sheet', referring to the rope fastened to the lower corner of a sail to hold it and control its
angle. The weight of the evidence, however, suggests that the term referred in POc to the
booms or poles used to extend and support a triangular sail, denoting either the upper pole
(the yard) or the lower pole (the boom). The use of reflexes of _*jila_ to denote a fixed mast is
confined to certain parts of Polynesia and this sense probably represents a post-PPn innovation.
Most Oceanic craft with triangular sails do not use a fixed mast. In one kind of rigging
(spritsail) the longer of the two poles extending the sail serves as the mast, with a mast-shore
or stays to secure it, or with the apex of the two poles resting on the deck. In another kind of
rigging (lateen), the mast is a separate moveable pole which pivots on a thwart in the dugout
or on a socket on the deck and is supported by ropes (stays or sheets) tied to the hull or
outrigger and sometimes by a mast-shore. The use of reflexes of _*jila_ for 'mast' and for
'sheet' in various Oceanic languages can thus be derived from the original functions of the
booms as supporting and controlling the sail.

7.5.3 Mast or props supporting mast

<
PEOc *kaiu-tuqu(r) (?) 'vertical supporting timber, prop supporting rig'
   SES: Arosi              auu                    (1) 'centre post of house' ; (2) 'mast'
   Mic: Carolinian         ayu                    'mast'
   Pn:  Tongan             kau-tuʔu               'yard on a mast'
   Pn:  Samoan             ʔau-tū                 (N) 'core, centre, main theme'; (V) 'centre around, revolve around s.t.'
   Pn:  Maori              |(rā) kau-tū|          'mast and sail' [17]
   cf. also:
   Adm: Seimat             |kau ehu|              'mast'
   PT:  Motu               |au tubua|             'mast, centre post of a house' (_au_ 'wood, stick', _tubua_ 'upright')
>

 POc _*kaiu-tuqu(r)_ (evidently a compound of _*kaiu_ 'wood, stick, pole' and _*tuqu(r)_ 'stand;
fixed') possibly referred to any main supporting timber including the prop or mast of a boat.
This compound has reflexes in Southeast Solomonic, Polynesian and Nuclear Micronesian
and possibly in Motu. It appears to have been already lexicalised in the immediate common
ancestor of these groups.

[17] According to Best (1925: 183), the term _ra kautu_ [=_raa kautuu_] refers to a (triangular) sail
with mast that is stepped upright in a cupped boss on the floor of the dugout.

<
PEOc *pana (?) 'mast, boom stepped on foot of mast'
  NCV: Mota            pane                'boom with forked end stepped on the foot of the mast'
  NCV: Mota            |pane (sila)|       'projecting boom of a sail'

  Pn:  Tokelauan       fanā                'mast'
>

As the Central Pacific languages in this comparison are all in the Fiji - West Polynesia region
and innovations in canoe design are known to have moved freely within this region, the PCP
antiquity of _*vanā_ may be questioned. On the other hand, the correspondences Fijian _v_,
Tongan, Samoan _f_ are regular, unlike recent Fijian-Polynesian borrowings, where Fijian _v_
has been borrowed as _v_. There is a possible cognate in Mota.


                                                                   Canoes and seafaring            197

7.5.4 Mast stays

   The following cognate set appears to be confined to Central Pacific:

<
PCP *tuku 'running stay supporting sail'
  Fij: Bauan            tuku
  Pn:  Tongan           tuku
  Pn:  Samoan           tuʔu               'running stay from foredeck'
  Pn:  Tokelauan        tuku               'guy rope of traditional sail, fastened to the outrigger'
>

These forms may be cognate with PCP _*tuku_ 'let go, slacken'. Again, the narrow geographic
range of this cognate set makes it hard to rule out diffusion.


7.6. Steering oar

   A PMP term for steering oar is well supported. Contemporary languages which retain this
term now apply it to rudders, but there is no reason to believe that rudders were in use in PMP
times. A verbal use 'steer (a boat from the stem)' can also be reconstructed. In many languages
this verbal use has now generalised to any kind of steering of a vessel or vehicle.

   It is not clear whether PMP _*be(R)(c,s)ay_ and _*paluja_ differed in meaning. As the Sichule
comparisons show, PMP _*paluja_ probably derives from a root _*luja_ denoting a paddle, with
the verb 'paddle' derived by adding the causative prefix _*pa-_. _*paluja_ is now widely reflected,
meaning both 'a paddle' and 'to paddle', but it may be that its use as a noun developed
independently in various languages.


200      Andrew and Medina Pawley


   A third form attributable to PEOc, _*sua(C)_, also has some reflexes glossed 'to paddle'.
However, the meanings associated with its putative reflexes are quite varied. These meanings
include (i) 'scull, in which a standing person holds the oar vertically', (ii) 'punt or pole a boat
in shallow water', (iii) 'to paddle', (iv) 'a paddle' and (v) 'to steer'. The range of meanings
suggests an original reference to a standing person using an oar or pole to propel or to steer a
boat. (cf. also PCP _*sua_ 'tack', §9.2.)

  The next comparison shows a PPn term for 'bailer' and 'bail', derived from a PMP form
which may have had a more restricted use.

Compare WMP: Cebuano _tata_ 'empty a container by turning it upside down'. This suggests
PMP _*tata_ 'empty water from something'.


7.7.5 Portable fireplace

    Seagoing canoes in many places carry a heap of sand, or an old clay pot or wooden basin
filled with sand or earth, for use as a fireplace. A reconstruction for such an apparatus can be
made only at PCP level:

<
PCP *tā-dravu 'portable fireplace or oven'
  Fij: Bauan          tā-dravu       'portable fireplace or oven'
  Pn:  Tongan         tā-lafu        'portable fireplace or oven'
  Pn:  Rennellese     tā-ŋahu        (N) 'fire'; (v) 'build a fire for illumination'
  Pn:  E. Uvean       ta-lafu        'cooking box filled with earth and small stones, formerly used in large sailing canoes'
  Pn:  Tokelauan      tā-lefu-lefu   'ashtray'
  cf. also:
  SES: Arosi          dohu           'white ashes, a fireplace'
  NCV: Mota           tarowo         'white ashes'
>

The PCP form can be analysed into two elements: the second is clearly _*dravu_ 'fireplace,
hearth', which reflects POc _*rapu(R)_ 'hearth, fireplace; ashes' (Ch. 6, §2.4). The origin of _*tā_
is less clear.


7.8. Launching and beaching, anchoring, sheltering vessels

   Outrigger canoes are normally launched from beaches and hauled ashore rather than
anchored when not in use. Anchors are not carried on small canoes (which may be left to
drift or tethered to the reef while fishing) but stone anchors were commonly carried aboard
larger vessels.

7.8.3 Passage or channel, landing place

   The PMP and POc term _*sawaŋ_ or _*sawaq_ appears to have been the conventional name
for a channel for boats to pass through or to land, or an area of calm water giving safe
anchorage. Blust (1983-84a: 113) reconstructs _*sawaq_ 'channel'.

<

>

   There is clear evidence for a POc compound consisting of _*mata_ 'opening, entrance; focal
point' plus _*sawaŋ_, with the sense 'landing place for boats' . The Southeast Solomonic and
Kiribatese forms suggest the POc compound had the form _*mata-ni-sawaŋ_, or _*mata-qi-sawaŋ_,
with one of the two POc genitive particles _*ni_ or _*qi_ (Hooper 1985) linking the two nouns.
However, the Admiralty Islands and Fijian forms do not reflect the genitive.

7.8.4 Boatshed

    While boatsheds, for building and sheltering boats, are common in the Malayo-Polynesian
speaking region, no really widespread cognate set for such a building has been noted outside
the Central Pacific group. Some Oceanic languages use a simple term reflecting PMP _*balay_
'house or building, probably with open sides' as Lou (Admiralties) _pal_ 'boatshed'. Others use
a compound nominal whose components, as in English, are the words for 'boat' and 'house' .
It may be that speakers of PMP used such a compound but it is hard to rule out the possibility
of independent parallel developments in the daughter languages. However, there is good
evidence for a distinctive PCP term for boatshed, evidently incorporating the term for 'make
a sea voyage' (see POc _*palau(r)_, §9.2):

<
PCP *(a)valau 'boatshed'
  Fij: Wayan          volau             'boatshed'

7.9. Seafaring terms

   A number of terms can be reconstructed at PMP or lower levels for concepts to do with
going to sea and navigation. The following is not an exhaustive list.

7.9.1 Embark, ride

<

  WMP: Cebuano        sakay            'travel by sea, embark, ride on (a boat +)'
  WMP: Ilokano        sakay            'ride in a boat'
  WMP: Bikol          (mag)-sakay      'ride in a boat'
  WMP: Sangir         sakaeŋ           'boat' (from PMP _*sakay-an_ lit. 'thing to ride on')
  CMP: Asilulu        saka             'ascend, climb'
  CMP: Selaru         sai              'climb, go up, ride, mount'
POc *sake 'embark, ride on a canoe' (prefix to numerals denoting number of crew carried by a canoe)
  SES: Lau            tae              'embark'
  SES: 'Are'are       taʔe             'ride, embark' (prefix in _taʔe taʔai_ 'one-man canoe', _taʔe rua_ 'two-man canoe +')
  NCV: Mota           sage             'prefix with numerals when men on board a canoe are numbered'
  Mic: Mokilese       tak              'ride on (a vessel +)'
  Mic: Ponapean       take             'ride'
  Mic: Carolinian     tāta             'ride on s.t.'
  Mic: Woleaian       tagē(a)          'ride on it, sail in it'
  Mic: Woleaian       (tet)tag         'ride'
  Fij: Wayan          ðake             'embark, go aboard'

Lawrence Reid (pers.comm.) suggests that the Malayo-Polynesian forms derive from a PAn
phrase whose constituents were _*pa_ 'go, towards' and _*iaSud_ 'sea, ocean', giving the meaning
'seawards (from inland)' contrasting with _*daya_ 'landwards, towards the interior (from the
sea or coast)'. In some languages, reflexes of _*pa-laSud_ are opposed to a phrase or parallel
structure meaning 'go inland, go to the mountains'. POc continued _*iaSud_ as _*lau(r)_ in its
original sense (e.g. Mota _lau_ 'seawards, coastwards') but evidently reanalysed the sequence
_*pa-iau(r)_ as a single morpheme.


                                                               Canoes and seafaring       207


   Blust (l 978a:216) offers the following:

POc *taRi ? 'steer a course'
 PT: Motu      tari             (N) 'rudder, steer oar'; (v) 'steer a canoe'
>

The sound correspondences are regular, but one would like further cognates to strengthen the
comparison. Lau _tari_ 'steer, keep straight on' and 'Are'are _tari_/_roro_ 'steer a canoe (the
steersman drawing the paddle towards himself with big strokes) show a superficial likeness
but are not demonstrably cognate, because _t_ in Malaitan languages derives from POc _*s_. Rick
Jackson (pers.comm.) reconstructs Proto Western Micronesian _*taraki_ 'sail, travel by sea'
with reflexes in Trukese, Ponapean and Marshallese but again the resemblance to PEMP
_*ta(d,R)i_ seems to be superficial.

7.9.4 Boat owner or captain


   In the following set the first element is again _*tau_ 'person, owner'. The agreement between
Polynesian and Papuan Tip languages may be the result of parallel development. However, in
both groups the formation of compounds with _*tau_ is no longer productive, so the chances
are that the compounds in question are quite old.

7.10. Conclusions

    Upwards of twenty terms to do with watercraft and seafaring can be reconstructed for
PMP. The comparative lexical evidence allows the following inferences. PMP speakers were
familiar with outrigger sailing canoes. Various clues indicate that craft could be quite large.
Hulls could be built up with planking. Skids or rollers were used to move vessels on land. A
steering paddle was used. Large canoes probably carried anchors. Cargo and paddles, punting
poles and bailers were carried on board.

    Virtually all the reconstructable PMP canoe and seafaring terms were continued in POc
and PCP. In addition, around ten terms can be attributed to POc and PCP that have not so far
been reconstructed for PMP. While these figures are impressive, they probably represent only
a small proportion of the total body of terms for canoes and seafaring used by the speech
communities in question. In contemporary societies where large sailing canoes remain in use,
it is usual for a language to have over one hundred terms for parts of the vessel alone.

    Some of the POc and PCP terms which do not have known sources in PMP may be formal
innovations. It seems likely, however, that in most cases the innovative forms replaced
functionally equivalent PMP terms whose forms are not recoverable on present evidence.
This conclusion rests on logical grounds: the presence of certain terms strongly implies that
other functionally connected terms also existed. Thus, while we cannot reconstruct with
certainty a PMP name for 'outrigger sailing canoe', we can reconstruct PMP terms for
'outrigger float', 'outrigger boom ', 'sail' and other relevant parts and equipment. It can
therefore safely be inferred that PMP speakers were familiar with outrigger sailing canoes.
Furthermore, it seems that all Oceanic languages have a general name for outrigger sailing
canoes (as well as, usually, a variety of terms for specific types). It would be very surprising
if such a name did not exist in PMP, even if it was not cognate with the term _*waŋka_/_*waga_
that has been reconstructed for PEMP and POc. The same reasoning applies, say, to 'canoe
platform', though with slightly less force. A term for such a platform, placed amidships over
hull and outrigger booms, is well supported for POc (_*patar_) but not for PMP. However, a
PMP term for 'load a vessel' and 'cargo, load carried by a vessel' is reconstructable and it is
therefore likely that PMP speakers built platforms on their larger, cargo-carrying outrigger
canoes. Although a PMP term for 'strake, plank (of canoe +)' is recoverable, implying
familiarity with built-up canoes, no term for the end-decking of a built-up canoe-minimally,
triangular end-pieces abutting the topstrake fore and aft-is attributable to PMP. But as
end-decking of some sort is a functional necessity in built-up seagoing outrigger canoes, it is
unlikely that PMP seagoing canoes would have lacked these essential parts.

    Further work will undoubtedly add to the body of relevant lexical reconstructions. However,
it is unlikely to fill all the gaps. Often the lexical evidence is not fine-grained enough to allow
us to recover certain details of vessel design. For example, the lexical reconstructions for the
sailing rig do not indicate whether the sails used by PMP speakers were triangular, crab claw
or rectangular or whether their vessels had fixed or moveable masts (or both). Nor do the
lexical reconstructions tell us whether PMP speakers made canoes with single or double
outriggers (or both). There is another reason why it is sometimes difficult to trace changes in
technological details through comparative linguistic evidence: whereas we can safely infer
knowledge of certain things by the presence of terms for them, we cannot so readily infer
ignorance from the lack of reconstructable terms. Consider the double-hulled canoe. A term
for double canoe can be attributed to PPn but not to POc. Can we therefore conclude that
such a craft was unknown to POc speakers? Certainly not. Inability to reconstruct a term for
a certain referent in Proto X does not prove that the referent itself, and a term for it, were
unknown to speakers of Proto X. The term may have been lost in all or most daughter
languages and its former existence obscured.

    The moral we might draw at this point is a rather obvious one: that for doing culture
history several disciplines are, ultimately, better than one. Linguistics and comparative
technology need each other, just as both need archaeology and comparative ethnography, to
corroborate each other's evidence on certain questions and to provide testimony on points
where the other disciplines are mute. It is, of course, important that each field of study
contribute its own independent witness before synthesis is attempted. The challenge then
becomes how to combine judiciously the evidence from different disciplines.



8 Fishing and hunting implements


An earlier version of this chapter is included in Lynch and Pat, eds, (1996). I am grateful to
Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross who have contributed substantially to the preparation of this
chapter, to Atholl Anderson for his comments and to Jean Kennedy for drawing my attention to
P.H. (Holly) McEldowney's thesis (1995), which contains a wealth of information on fishing
techniques in the Admiralties.


8.1 Introduction

   This chapter takes a close look at terms for fishing and hunting implements and processes
attributable to Proto Oceanic (POc), with a view to reconstructing a small portion of the
culture of POc speakers.[1] There is ample linguistic evidence that these people were fishermen
and seafarers. The Oceanic Lexicon Project has collected cognate sets supporting POc
reconstructions for over eighty fish names and an additional forty terms for shellfish (see vol.
3). This paper adds a further twenty terms for various fishing techniques used, both for
deep-sea fishing requiring line and hook capture and for coastal, reef or river fishing where
netting, spearing, poisoning or fish-trapping could suffice. We also know that a number of
animals, birds and reptiles were hunted for food, and terms for many of these have been
reconstructed. Here we attempt to establish terms for the hunting implements and techniques
used.


8.2 Nets

   Most Oceanic languages have a wide range of terms for different kinds of nets. These
include terms for hand nets, casting nets, seine nets, long-handled nets for catching flying
fish, and so on. Many languages have terms for nets for catching birds and occasionally
larger animals, such as pigs and wallabies. Presumably there were POc terms for a wider
range of nets than the four we have reconstructed.

Reflexes of _*pukot_ meaning specifically 'seine' occur in both WOc (Kove, Nakanai) and
EOc (Arosi, Sa'a) witnesses. This suggests the strong possibility that _*pukot_ denoted 'seine' in
POco The more generalised meanings of other witnesses do not rule out this implication.

_*reke_ perhaps also referred to a seine net, but its Eastern Oceanic reflexes imply that it may
have referred to an end or pocket of the net.

      The fourth term, _*ku(p,pʷ)ena_, is the most widespread term of the four, and arguably the
best bet for a POc generic term for fishing nets. Our files list more than forty cognates from
all major subgroups. In Tuvalu (Koch n.d.: 30) the _kupeŋa_ is "a primitive kind of net … large
and heavy and knotted from rolled coconut fibre twine … affixed to two poles tied together at
one end forming a n acute angle; large cowrie shells are fixed under the edge of the third
side". Two men hold the poles, and the net is tilted so the fish can swim into it. In parts of
Polynesia, the term is used as a generic. On Niuatoputapu (Tonga), _kupeŋa_ is the term used
for all netting techniques, as opposed to _tau_ (angling) or _uku_ (diving) (Dye 1983: 252-254).
Dye lists _kupeŋa fakamamaha_ 'netting with the ebbing tide ' ; _kupeŋa ʔava_ 'netting for _ʔava_
(milkfish)'; _kupeŋa hokohoka_, in which a handled net is used in rough surf; _kupeŋa sili
pulou_, where the common throw net, about three metres across, is used to catch bait fish; and
so on. In Rennell, the term evidently subsumes all kinds of nets. Although Elbert (1975)
defines _kupeŋa_ as 'fine-meshed fishing net', he includes _kupeŋa tape peka_ 'flying fox snaring
net', as well as six kinds of fishing nets labelled with compound terms beginning with
_kupeŋa_. The same general term _kupeŋa_ 'net, traditionally of hibiscus fibre' is found in
Tikopia, with particular types named as compounds (_kupeŋa tā save_ 'pole net for flying fish',
_kupeŋa fukifuki_ 'pole net for reef work') and _mata kupeŋa_ referring to net mesh.

   The techniques that involve large nets usually require use of floats and sinkers. We have a
reconstruction for net float:

<

There is also a competing form that co-exists with _*utoŋ_ in the Central Pacific, PCP _*vuta_
(Rotuman _hufa_ 'float on a fishing net', Tikopia _futa_ 'net float').

   The only terms I can locate for sinker are reflexes of POc _*patu_ 'stone', or the name of
the cowrie shell which is sometimes used as a sinker:

   Other reconstructions that can be included within the vocabulary of nets are:

<
POc *sika 'netting needle'

POc *mata- 'mesh of net'
 NNG: Kove          mata              'net gauge'
 PT:  Molima        mata-             'net gauge'
 SES: Arosi         mā                'hole; opening; mesh of net'

 Pn:  Hawaiian      maka              'mesh of net'
>

 POc _*mata-_ and its reflexes in many contemporary languages extend to a range of concepts
that carry the idea of an opening, a doorway, something allowing access, and thus the mesh
of a net. Evidence is that it is used in connection with nets in both Western Oceanic, as 'net
gauge', and Eastern Oceanic, as 'mesh of net'. Presumably the POc term embraced the idea
of 'mesh of net' in both places, but in WOc languages reflexes now refer to the instrument
used to maintain uniform mesh when net-making. 

Another term for net gauge is found in Eastern Oceania:

8.3 Scareline

   Some communities use a scareline for fishing, in which leaves are tied to a long rope
which is drawn through the water. A term for this has been reconstructed to PCP level,
although it is possible that cognates are derived from POc _*raun_ 'leaf':

<
PCP *rau 'dragline, scareline, made from rope and coconut leaves'
 Fij: Wayan          |rau (sole)|        'barrier of leaves used in a sole rau or ara-rau fish drive'
 Pn:  Tongan         au                  'long fishing net made of rope and coconut leaves'
 Pn:  Tikopia        rau                 'sweep with a net'
>

However, in Andra (Admiralties) a leaf sweep is called _you_, pointing to POc _*Rau(C)_ rather
than _*raun_.


8.4 Angling implements

  Use of fishhooks was evidently not an automatic 'given' in western Oceanic communities.
Ann Chowning (pers.comm.) has commented that

|   at the time of European contact, a number of societies did not use fish hooks, even though
|   the archaeological evidence makes it clear that they can be attributed to POc culture. The
|   Nakanai were a case in point. In some other societies, such as Sengseng, line and bait fishing
|   were done only by using a gorge, pointed at both ends, or sometimes, as I have seen the
|   Molima do, bait was simply tied to a line and the fish pulled out when it swallowed the bait.
|   In many places fishing with hook and line is a post-contact phenomenon.

Nonetheless, the linguistic evidence leaves us in no doubt that POc speakers were familiar
with the technique.

 POc _*kawil_ is widely attested. I have over fifty reflexes containing specific reference to
fishhooks, occurring in all major subgroups. In Tuvalu it is used as a generic, followed by the
name of the fish for which it is appropriate - _kau galata_, _kau palu_, etc. It has an obvious
formal and semantic relationship with _*kawi(t)_, _*kawit-i-_ (V) 'hook, catch hold of; fruit
crook' (Ch. 5, § l O), but the origin of this relationship is not understood.

    The extension of a meaning from a material to something made from that material is very
common across languages (viz. English _glass_/_a glass_, _cork_/_a cork_). Examples occur in Oceanic
languages as well (Bauan _gasau_ 'a reed ; an arrow ', Tolai _vat_ 'a stone, a sinker'). POc
speakers evidently made fishhooks from a variety of shells, and in some daughter languages
the term for a particular shell has become the term for a fishhook (made from that shell?).
For instance, POc _*kima_ 'clamshell' is reflected in some Central Papuan languages as _kimai_
'fishhook' (Ross 1994a: 404). A similar example is:

<
PMP *qunap 'scales' (Dempwolff 1938)
POc *qunap 'turtle shell, fishhook'
 NNG: Rauto            a-una              'fishhook'

 SES: Ghari            unua-na            'turtle scales (not turtle shell)'
 SES: Arosi            una-na             'tortoiseshell' (una 'fish scales')
 Pn:  Rennellese       ʔuna               'outer shell (of turtle +)'
 Pn:  Samoan           una                'scale; scale of hawk's bill turtle, i.e. tortoise-shell'
 Pn:  Tuvalu           una                'turtle shell'
 Pn:  Tikopia          una                'carapace of marine turtle'
 Pn:  Hawaiian         una                'shell of turtle'
>


Final _*-p_ is reconstructed because this item is almost certainly identical to POc _*qunap_ 'fish
scales'. The Arosi (SES) verb derived from this term, _unahi-_ 'remove shell from turtle, scale
a fish' (see Ch. 6, §5.4), reflects _*-p-_ and refers to the removal of both turtle shell and fish
scales.

   We have evidence, both archaeological and linguistic, that trolling lures were also widely
used. This technique of dragging a line through the water, with a lure of mother-of-pearl or

It would appear that in some Southeast Solomonic languages and also in Fiji, reflexes of POc
_*bayan_ have split into doublets, evidently to distinguish 'bait' from 'trolling lure'. Because
there is crossover of meaning, with the long-vowel form referring to bait in one region and
trolling lure in the other, it is assumed that the two splits occurred independently. Nor can the
possibility of borrowing be discounted.

   John Lynch (pers.comm.) points out that the final _-ñ_ of Anejom _ne-pyañ_ reflects earlier
_*-ni_, implying POc _**bayani_. However, a number of the forms above reflect a loss of final
_*-n_ which would not have occurred if the form had been _**bayani_. It is possible, however,
that Anejom _ne-pyañ_ reflects a conflation of *bayan and _*bani_ (below), forms which are
similar but, it appears, not cognate.

A form PMP/POc _*baŋi_ 'bait', is reconstructable on the basis of Javanese _baŋi_ 'bait' and the
obsolete Samoan _paŋi_ 'coconut bait for flying fish'. Its relationship to the reconstructions
above is unclear.

[3]   Chowning (pers.comm.) points out that the Molima, and also the inhabitants of Goodenough Island,
traditionally made their fish hooks out of the leg of a phasmid insect. This presumably combined the
functions of hook and bait.

The term is widely attested. It is noteworthy that we have no Polynesian cognates. Instead we
find PPn _*fīnaki_ (Tongan _finaki_, Rarotongan _ʔinaki_ 'fish trap'; Hawaiian _hīnaʔi_ 'k.o. basket

8.6 Fish weir

    Pn:  Rarotongan      pā                 'fish weir of stone walls'
>

The POc term _*baRa_ 'fence, wall, enclosure' (Ch. 3, §3.6) has evidently acquired an additional
specialised meaning in the Central Pacific, where it refers to a fish trap made of stone or
sometimes of sticks. (The Lou (Admiralties) term _pas_ 'stone fish corral' has unexplained _-s_,
and at this stage cannot be accepted as a cognate.) In Oceania, walls of stone or coral are
constructed across channels in the reef to catch fish on a falling tide. In the Cook Islands
(Rarotonga), _pā_ has become a generic. Buck (1927:298) writes that:

|     Most of the _pa_ are very old, having been laid down far back in pre-European times. The
|     channels were studied and the course taken by fish observed. The lines of the walls were laid
|     down with such skil l and accuracy that any departure from them ends in failure. The wall s
|     are made o f loose coral rock. The most important weirs are named, and are owned by
|     particular families. No outsider can use a weir without permission from the hereditary owners.

He describes various types of weirs, for example, _pa kiokio_ (roughly Z-shaped), _pa tute_
(temporary), and _pa tuakirua_ (V-shaped with opening towards the sea).

From North New Guinea and New Ireland we have been able to reconstruct a lower-level

  NNG: Gitua               (waro)mali(ŋ)
  MM:  Nalik               mal-mal
>

The method of stunning fish by throwing pounded Derris root into pools is widespread, and
the three terms seem to have identical reference, although Derris eliptica is not mentioned
specifically in relation to _*puna_. Describing the technique used by Sa'a speakers, a Southeast
Solomons language, Ivens (1927 (reissued 1972):389) writes that:

|   … fish in streams are poisoned by a preparation. The bark of the edible Barringtonia tree, the
|   one with red flowers, is stripped off and heated in the fue to bring out its bitter qualities. It is
|   then beaten into shreds with stones in water and thrown into the place chosen. Along with it
|   they use the grated nuts of the barringtonia speciosa [sic.], a littoral tree. A third ingredient is
|   made from pounded sections of a creeper called uhe, the juices of which are very bitter.

The last ingredient is obviously a variant of _uha_, a reflex of POc _*tupa_.

   The kernel of the fruit of Barringtonia asiatica (POc _*putun_) is used for poisoning water
in Samoa, while the Fijians use the outer portion of the same fruit (Blackwood 1935:354-355),
but I have not been able to reconstruct a term for this.


8.8 Torch fishing

<

  Pn:  Samoan        lama               'torch (made of dry coconut leaflets +); fishing with torches'
  Pn:  Maori         rama               'torch; eeling with torches'
>

    Night-fishing is still a popular and widespread activity throughout the region. To attract
the fish, a torch is used which consists of dried coconut fronds or spathes bound together to
burn slowly over a long period. In many languages the same term refers both to the torch and
to the activity. In Tonga, _lama_ can simply be prefixed to the names of other fishing techniques
to indicate that it is carried out at night (e.g. _lama fakasiosio_ 'go spear-fishing at night').
(The ambiguity of the initial consonant _*(d)r-_ is touched on in Chapter 2, §3.1.3.)

8.9 Pointed weapons

    Most Oceanic languages contain a number of terms for spear, and it is probable that POc
was no exception. There are various ways in which spears can be physically distinguished.
There may be a distinction between fishing, fowling and fighting spears. Often, but not
always, fishing spears have three or more prongs. Shorter spears can be used for thrusting,
longer spears for hurling. Spears can be multi-barbed, have a single barb, or be barbless. They
can be made with a head that separates from the shaft. Every language community will name
its spears according to combinations of these and possibly other properties. Although we have
been able to reconstruct perhaps six POc terms, it has been difficult to distinguish between
them, other than to single out _*tara_ and _*kuj(u,i)r_ as probably fish spears. At the generic
level-and that is itself a flexible category which can include arrows, and possibly other
pointed weapons such as darts and spikes - _*qio(r,R)_ seems to have the widest distribution,
although it does not occur east of Vanuatu. For the Central Pacific, _*sao(t)_ seems the most
likely generic term. In POc times, some spears would have had obsidian heads, and the term
used for these was evidently *koto 'obsidian head of spear' (Ch. 4, §4.1.3).

As a subset of the above, certain NNG languages have inserted a medial consonant derived
from epenthetic glides: Kove _iðo_ 'spear'; Bariai _ido_ 'arrow'; Gitua _izo_ 'spear'; Wogeo _iwo_
'spear'. This appears to be a local feature, but not attributable to a common protolanguage.

indeed referred to a multi-pronged fish spear.

The Fijian and the Tahitian cognates have strayed semantically, yet still retain the idea of
something held so tautly that it distorts.


8.10 Club

    Across the Pacific, the kind of weapon that is labelled 'club' varies from the great knobbed,
obsidian-studded roots that can be seen in the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, to the flat round
stone clubs of the Motu (_gahi_), to the smaller, lighter throwing clubs of Fiji (_i ula_: Clunie
1977), and to the Kiribatese _kati-popuki_ - about four feet long, pointed at both ends, used for
warding off a spear, making a thrust, or wielding as a club (Hudson 1841, quoted in Koch
1986:249), which might equally be classified as a shield or lance. I consider these to be more
or less marginal examples of what is basically a blunt, heavy instrument, wielded in the hand
for bludgeoning.

    In the Southeast Solomons, Fiji and Polynesia at least (I have little information from
Western Oceania), clubs have an importance beyond that of simply weapons. They often
carry ceremonial weight. Many are heirlooms with names and magical powers. Special reverence
is accorded the war club. To the extent that it is possible to distinguish war clubs from
hunting clubs, I do not intend to delve further into the culture and terminology of the former.
It is my guess that hunting clubs would have carried less cultural significance, and as a result,
been labelled more broadly. Two terms have been reconstructed.[5] In each case I have included
all known cognates. It will be apparent that neither reconstruction is particularly soundly
based. Nor do their cognates provide much information as to the shape, material or specific
function of each club:

[5]   A putative third construction, POC _*nalanala_, 'club' (from Motu _tanala_
'egg-shaped stone club', Tolai _nalnal_ 'battle axe', Maringe _nalanala_ 'wooden club',
Longgu _nalanala_ 'club') is discounted on the basis of evidence that it is a borrowing from
the Pidgin spoken along the east coast of Australia last century, this in turn deriving from
_ŋalaŋala_ 'a hardwood club used in fighting and hunting', a term from the language
spoken around Sydney at the time of the first settlement (Jaki Troy, pers.comm.). The term _nalnal_
still exists in Bislama (Ross Clark, pers.comm.).

228      Meredith Osmond

Slingshots would have been used for hunting birds, flying foxes and perhaps the cuscus.[6]
Although it is assumed that ordinary well-shaped stones were used, Green (1979: 39) has
documented a pointed-end Tridacna shell slingstone from Main Reef Islands circa 1000 BC.

[6]   Chowning (pers.comm.) comments that slings were also used for warfare in some places,
as among the Tolai and in the D'Entrecasteaux, including the Dobu area. The Molima say they
were particularly popular for fighting from canoes.

  SES: Arosi            suda                 'stake set slanting and sharpened in a pit for the enemy'

The setting of sharp spikes or slivers of wood or bamboo, hardened in the fire, either directly
into a path, or at the bottom of a pit, is also known in Fiji (Bauan _soki_, 'spike'; _lovosa_ 'pitfall
man trap'), but I cannot locate any other Oceanic reflexes of PMP _*suja_. Nonetheless, given
the external evidence, the reconstruction must stand. It may be that this was primarily a
warfare technique, and that a different term was used for the pit-trapping without spikes of
pigs and smaller ground animals like lizards.


8.13 Snare trap

   Birds are caught for food throughout the region, often by netting or by ground snares,
fashioned from a spring-laden twig and a noose. Although I can locate many terms which
refer to snare, noose and bird trap, the cognate sets collected are few. The following term
was both a noun and a verb. Terms reflecting _**piti_ in MM and SES languages seem to be
local inventions formed from a noun _**pit_ (after loss of POc _*-a_) with the addition of the
transitive suffix _*-i-_.

8.14 Birdlime

   Another widespread method of catching birds involves the use of birdlime. Hooley describes
the technique used by Mapos Buang speakers in the Huon Gulf region of New Guinea:

|   The sap of this tree (dagXem) is used as birdlime for catching birds. The sap is collected in a
|   length of bamboo and is then heated over a fire. When it is boiling a stick is dipped in and
|   twisted and the sap adhering to it is chewed to make it soft and then wrapped in cordyline
|   leaves. The sap is then spread on a suitable tree branch so that when birds come to eat the
|   fruit of that tree they are caught. (from word list held on computer file at ANU)

Blust (1983-84a) has reconstructed Proto WMP _*pikat_ or _*piket_ 'birdlime' and _*mamikat_ or
_*makiket_ 'snare birds with birdlime', but I have not been able to locate any Oceanic reflexes.
The reconstruction given below evidently refers generally to gum or resin, although in one
instance, in Arosi, it is the first element in a compound, _buruhasi_, meaning 'bird trap'. The
second element, _hasi_, means 'adhere'.

8.15. Archaeological evidence

   Evidence comes both directly from the existence of artefacts themselves in archaeological
sites-the fishhooks, trolling lures, stone fish traps, spear tips and so on - and indirectly
through analysis of remains in Lapita middens, which provide evidence of Lapita people's
diet and (indirectly) for food procurement techniques.

230    Meredith Osmond


   Spriggs (1997a: 114) summarises non-vegetable food traces from an Eloaue site on Mussau,
east of the Admiralties, believed to have been occupied between about 3,500 and 2,500
years ago. (Eloaue is a low, flat, coral island south-east of the high island of Mussau.)

|   Large quantities of shell rllidden occurred in the site …The three Oceanic domesticates, pig,
|   dog and chicken, were present but only in smal l numbers. 95 per cent of the bone was of fish,
|   mainly inshore species, and turtle. Present too in small quantities were porpoise, reptiles,
|   birds, rats and also the phalanger Spilocuscus maculatus (p. 117).

    A similar range of fauna to Mussau's occurs in the Lapita sites in the Arawe Islands, off
the south-west of New Britain, with the addition of a wallaby, Thylogale browni and the
flightless cassowary as introduced species (p. 120). A site on Watom, off the north-east tip of
New Britain, adds bandicoot to the faunal repertoire (p. 124). Lapita sites from the Solomons
provide little evidence, while the Reef-Santa Cruz Islands, next in line as one moves east,
show a decline in the range and diversity of animal life available for food, a decline that
increases as one moves progressively further out into the Pacific. Spriggs records that "hunting
took place of what local species of birds, bats and sea creatures such as turtles and dugongs
there were, as well as collecting of reef and lagoon fish and shellfish". (p. 135)

   Artefacts are considered alongside the linguistic evidence. With regard to angling, we have
the following POc reconstructions:

__pre__
  *apon                   'fishing line'
  *kawil                  'fishhook'
  *ta(g,k)o               'barbless (?) fishhook'
  *qunap                  'turtle shell; fishhook'
  *bayan                  'trolling lure'
  *bani, *baŋi            'bait; fodder'

Of these items, fishhooks have proved the most useful in developing local culture sequences.
One-piece fishhooks made from several kinds of shell are now well documented from a
number of Lapita sites, ranging from Talepakemalai (Mussau) to Lolokoka (Niuatoputapu,
Tonga), one site at the latter dating back to about 2800 BP. "Most of the Mussau hooks are
fairly large (about 5 cm in shank length) and were probably designed for hand-lining from
canoes, in order to catch larger benthic species such as groupers. A few hooks are smaller,
however, and could have been used for taking smaller species on reefs and along coastlines."
(Kirch 1997: 200). Most hooks so far found are of Turbo, Trochus and pearlshell. Linguistic
evidence supports clamshell and tortoiseshell. Presumably all of these were used, as well as
the less durable coconut shell, bone and Pemphis acidula wood, which are in use today. Also
from Mussau sites come examples of carefully crafted lures made from Trochus shell. These
trolling lures "are streamlined for hydrodynamic lift in the water, and have finely carved
grooves for attaching both the line and hackles (probably feathers or pig bristles) near the
recurved point". (pp.200-201)

   More elaborate two-piece fishhooks with separate shank and point were apparently a later
development, appearing in Eastern Polynesia and possibly originating in the Marquesas Islands
(Bellwood 1987:58).

   A pertinent observation on the connection between present-day fishing techniques and
those of the early Lapita settlers is made by Kirch and Yen (1982) in their study of the
prehistory of Tikopia (initial settlement dates to around 2875-2750 BP). They have assembled
a collection of one-piece fishhooks and three distinctive early trolling hooks made from
trochus shell, which are associated with Lapita sites. They note (p.243) that:

                                                     Fishing and hunting implements             231


|   While we must be cautious in interpreting archaeological fishhooks on the basis of ethnographic
|   observations of the use of modern metal hooks, the data are suggestive that Tikopia utilised a
|   similarly broad range of angling strategies in prehistoric times. Group I hooks would have
|   been best suited to catching small fry on the fringing reefs. Group II hooks, the most varied,
|   were likely used for more than one strategy, and towline and bottom-fishing techniques,
|   among others, seem likely. The largest specimens, Group III, would seem to have been
|   intended for towline capture of carniverous pelagic fish or bottom fishing for large groupers,
|   Ruvettus, and the like. Such an interpretation of the angling gear is consistent with the range
|   of fish taxa identified in the Tikopia faunal material.

   We have eight POc terms that relate to netting:

__pre__
  *pukot                 'fishing net, seine'
  *reke                  'fishing net, seine net'
  *lawa((n,q))           'k.o. fishnet'
  *kupr')ena             'net, generic term (?)'
  *utOŋ                  'net float'
  *buli(q)               'cowrie shell used as net sinker'
  *sika                  'netting needle'
  *mata-                 'mesh of net'

Although netting itself will not endure, we have limited physical evidence of dragnetting
from Tikopia in the form of cowrie shell net weights. Kirch and Yen (p.245) have been able
to identify shells and stones from a Lapita site as net weights and line sinkers:

|   Tikopia women frequently scour the reef flats with small two-handled dip nets, _te kuti_, the
|   edge of which is weighted with small Cypraea shells. Such shells have the dorsum removed
|   to facilitate lashing … Two line sinkers were [also] found, each consisting of a natural
|   cobble … with an artificially pecked groove running laterally round the stone. Such grooved
|   cobbles are still used on occasion by Tikopia fishermen.

   It is unlikely that the remainder of our fishing terminology, with the possible exception of
the stone fish weirs, can ever be supported by archaeological evidence:

__pre__
 *pupu                   'basketry fish trap'
 *baRa                   'fence' ('fish weir' only in PCP)
 *tupa                   'derris fish poison'
 *puna                   'vine used for fish poison'
 *(d)rama(R)             (N) 'torch'; (V) 'fish at night with torch'

The pointed weapon terminology consists of:

__pre__
  *sao(t)                    (N, V) 'spear'
  *sua                       (N, V) 'spear, weapon retained in the hand'
  *soka, *soka-i-            'pierce; stab'
  *qio(r,R)                  'spear'
  *bako                      'spear'
  *kuj(u,i)r                 'fish spear'
  *tara                      'fish spear'
  *koto                      'obsidian head of spear'
  *pusuR                     'bow and arrow'
  *(p,pʷ)anaq, (p,pʷ)anaq-i- 'bow'; (V) 'shoot'
  *tibʷa(ŋ), *tibʷaŋ-i-      'dart, arrow; shoot with dart, arrow'
  *lolo(s)                   'bowstring'

                           232                  Meredith Osmond


The only archaeological evidence we have for spears, bows and arrows, darts, etc. would
seem to be obsidian and bone spear points. Triangular-sectioned obsidian blades are an
artefact form produced only in the Manus Group and were almost certainly spearpoints
(Spriggs 1997a:163). They were manufactured in the vicinity of the main obsidian sources in
the Lou Island area by 2100 BP (pp. 162-164). Green (1979:39) documents a bone spear-point
from Main Reef Islands circa 3100 BP.

   I can find no archaeological evidence for any kind of club, our two (weakly supported)
terms notwithstanding:

__pre__
     *paru         (N, V) 'club'
     *gapi         'stone? club'

However, for the slingshot we have pointed-end tridachna shell slingstones from Main Reef
Islands documented by Green (1979:39):

__pre__
    *maga                    'slingshot; stone'
    *kalo                    'sling; tum round and round'

   The trail and pitfall spikes, the snare trap and the birdlime lack any supporting evidence
from archaeology.

__pre__
   *suja                       'sharpened stake set in ground'
   *pʷita, *pʷita-i-           (N, V) 'snare'
   *bulit                      'gum, resin (birdlime?)'

   Although we can look to archaeology to confirm the hypothesis that durable artefacts will
be found in sites associated with Oceanic-speaking communities, there is little hope of
archaeological recovery of the perishable artefacts in question. Here, linguistics adds an extra
dimension to research on the prehistory of Oceania.



9 Acts of impact, force and change of state


[1] Ross Clark did the initial collation and classification of data, Meredith Osmond wrote the first draft, also
collating reconstructions drawn from other chapters, and Malcolm Ross refined and added reconstructions,
partially reorganised the chapter and rewrote much of it.


9.1 Introduction

   The theme of this volume is material culture, and it is perhaps inevitable that a majority of
the reconstructions in the preceding chapters are of nouns denoting objects - mostly utensils
and some manufactured objects, especially buildings and seagoing vessels. A number of
reconstructions are of verbs denoting actions performed with these utensils or on the materials
of which objects are made. In many cases, however, the relevant verbs have meanings which
transcend the subthemes of individual chapters, and so we have decided to bring them
together here and to consider them in relation to each other in order to gain a better understanding
of their meanings. This leads to a certain amount of repetition, but we have thought it more
convenient for the reader to have much of the data assembled here than to have to pursue
cross-references to earlier chapters. In the interests of space, however, we have generally not
repeated here those verbs whose meanings fit neatly enough under the subtheme of another
chapter, and we have sometimes reduced the cognate sets given as supporting evidence.

   Some system of classification was necessary to give coherence to our work, and we
started with a classification based on what we thought were sensible but somewhat ad hoc
semantic classes. Interestingly, as work progressed and the glosses of cognate set members
gave us pointers to the meanings of our reconstructions, so the meanings of the reconstructions
themselves led us to reshape our classification and to recognise semantic divisions which
were not part of our original classification. In this way, we believe we have gained some
insight into the semantic classification of acts of impact, force and change of state used by
POc speakers.

The final classification of reconstructions, with section numbers, is as follows:

FIXME: add ToC



234    Malcolm Ross, Ross Clark and Meredith Osmond

Possibly the most interesting categories that emerged were 'separate flesh from shell, skin
from fruit, bark from tree, leaves from branch or midrib' and 'split into two or more sections'.
Perhaps the first of these could be more quintessentially expressed as something like 'separate
one naturally occurring layer of an object from the rest'. In each case the conceptual focus
seems to be on the separation itself, not the manner in which it is done. Because of this focus,
we found ourselves impelled to combine different manners of separation -cutting, peeling,
separating, splitting and tearing-into a single higher-order grouping, as they seem not to
have been as important for classifiying actions in POc as they are in European languages.

   The formal categories of POc verbs are particularly salient in this chapter. They are
explained in greater detail in Chapter 2, §3.1.1. Many verbs can be reconstructed with both
an intransitive and a transitive alternant. Two patterns commonly occur. They are illustrated
by the first two reconstructions in §2.1. In the first pattern, the intransitive has two syllables
and ends in a consonant (shown in brackets if it is not reflected in the supporting data), and
the transitive alternant has an added _*-i-_ e.g. POc _*asa(q)_, _*asaq-i-_ 'grate, sharpen by grating
or rubbing'. The hyphen on the transitive means that it was usually followed by an enclitic
object pronoun. In the second pattern, represented by POc _*kiri[-]_ 'file, rasp, saw', there is no
final consonant, and the intransitive and transitive are identical, with two syllables. The
hyphen in square brackets indicates that nothing follows the intransitive alternant, but that an
enclitic object pronoun follows the transitive.

                                           Acts of impact, force and change of state              235


    With verbs of the first pattern, we sometimes present the intransitive and transitive alternants
separately with their supporting data if these form long lists, and sometimes together.

    There is a third pattern represented in the reconstructions in this chapter. Here, the intransitive
consists of a single-syllable 'root' with a reduplication of the initial consonant-vowel sequence,
as in POc _*toto(k)_ 'cut, chop' (§3.2), where the root is *tok. The transitive consists of the root
with added _*-i-_ as in POc _*toki_.

    Sometimes, as explained in Chapter 2, §3.1.1, we are unable to determine from the
cognate set what verb class a given intransitive verb belonged to. This means that the glosses
of intransitive verb reconstructions are sometimes vague, because we do not know whether
the actor or the undergoer was the subject.

    Another alternation that occurs, but has nothing to do with transitivity, is between a
reconstruction with an oral-grade initial consonant, like POc _*kiri[-]_ 'file, rasp, saw', and one
with a nasal-grade initial consonant, like POc _*giri[-]_ 'file, rasp'. Where such an alternation
is reconstructed, the alternant reconstructions are labelled (1) and (2). The possible origins of
this alternation are discussed in Chapter 2, §3.1.3.

    A practical problem in the analysis for this chapter was that it is often necessary to
reconstruct two or more formally similar verbs. There are some quite principled reasons for
this, and some which are more ad hoc. The more principled explanations are that (i) a verb
may have intransitive and transitive alternants, as noted above; (ii) verbs with similar meanings
often contain the same PAn monosyllabic root, as described in Chapter 2, §3.1.3 ; (iii) as
mentioned in the previous paragraph, verbs with corresponding oral-grade and nasal-grade
consonants must sometimes be reconstructed. Once verbs with similar forms and meanings
exist alongside each other, the conflation of two forms to make a new one is quite possible or
phonaesthetic motives may lead to the creation of new but similar forms. In §2.2, appeal is
made to a sporadic sound change which occurs in Oceanic languages in order to explain some
of the similarities among verbs of scratching and scraping. It is probable, though, that
phonaesthetic motives have also operated here as they appear to in English scratch, scrap,
scrape, scrawl, scribble, scrimp.


9.2 Abrasion and friction

   The verbs in this section refer to continuously repeated contact between an implement and
an object to affect the surface of that object in some way, either by removing some of the
substance of the object itself (file, rasp, sharpen, grind, scratch, scrape, grate) or by removing
another substance from its surface (rub, brush, sweep).

9.2.1 File, rasp, sharpen, grind

   The generic term for any kind of wearing down by friction was  POc _*asa(q)_, _*asaq-i-_
(Ch. 4, §4.1.5). While it is possible to reconstruct several terms that refer just or primarily to the
grating of foodstuffs, it has proven more difficult to reconstruct a term referring specifically
to the sharpening of cutting edges.  POc _*kiri_/_*giri_ is our most likely contender.

9.2.2 Scratch, scrape, grate

   Various activities are subsumed under this heading. They include the separation of coconut
meat from the shell, the grating of foodstuffs (coconut meat, cassava etc.), the scraping of
tubers to remove dirt and ash, and the scratching of a (non-food) surface, sometimes with the
intention of leaving a mark. Distinguishing reflexes of some of our reconstructions has
proved difficult because some are formally quite similar. Distinguishing which term was used
for which activity is also problematic, since it would appear that often communities see these
activities as essentially describable by the same term, in that they are using the same action of
moving an implement, typically a cockle shell or similar bivalve, to and fro to affect the
surface of an object. Sometimes the name of the shell suffices to describe the activity.

   POc _*karu(t)_, _*karut-i-_ seems to have referred to scratching with fingernails or claws, and
thus not to have been used of food preparation:

   Lichtenberk (1994) rightly comments on the formal similarity of terms used for scraping
(data below) and on its phonaesthetic basis:
                                                                           ,

   POc *ko[r,Rja(s), *ko[r,Rjas-i- 'scrape out (coconut meat +); dregs of strained coconut scrapings'
2) POc *kari(s), *karis-i-         'scrape (tubers, coconuts)'
   PEOc *kori(s), *koris-i-        'scrape (esp. coconuts), grate (esp. coconuts)'
3) PEOc *kaRi                      'scraper; bivalve sp., used as a scraper'

4) POc *kasi[-]                    'k.o. mussel, used as food scraper; scrape out or off'
   POc *kosi[-]                    'scrape, scratch (to mark s.t.)'

However, it is notable that the reconstructions above form pairs which can be accounted for
by a sporadic sound change whereby /a/ becomes /o/ after /k/ in many Oceanic languages,
perhaps especially in frequently used words. This change occurs independently in different
places, presumably through velarisation of the vowel. Thus in Chapter 6, §3.7, we find POc
_*kapu(t)_ and POc _*kopu_, both reflecting PMP _*kaput_ and referring to wrapping food for
cooking, and in Chapter 6, §2.7, POc _*kapit_ 'tongs' with Tongan and W. Futunan reflexes
where the root is _kofi_ rather than _kafi_. In certain Papuan Tip languages the POc pronoun
_*kamiu_ 'you (PL)' is reflected with /o/ for _*a_ (Iduna _omi_, Dobu _ʔomi_, Duau, Suau _komi_,
Misima _komiu_). This implies that each pair may represent only one POc form, as shown
below. We incorporate Lichtenberk's (1994: 280-281) insight that these verbs differ according
to whether the object is stuff scraped off (e.g. coconut meat) or the object of scraping (e.g.
coconut shell):

__ul__
1) POc *karas, *karas-i-            'peel or scrape off (stuff scraped off); itch'
2) POc *kari(s), *karis-i-          'scrape (object of scrapiI).g)'
3) PEOc *kaRi[-]                    'scraper; bivalve sp., used as a scraper; scrape with a shell'
4) POc *kasi[-]                     'k.o. mussel, used as food scraper; scrape out or off (stuff scraped out or off); scratch'

We retain the pairs of forms below, because this interpretation is not conclusive: POc _*kosi_
may reflect PAn _*keskes_.

[2]  To our knowledge this PAn root has not been reconstructed elsewhere, but is supported by this POc

  PMP _*rasras_, and by PMP _*biras_ and _*kiras_, both 'scar', and by PWMP _*paras_ 'shaved off, made
  smooth' (all ACD).

items are indeed cognate, then the initial consonant is diambiguated and the verb was _*rasi_.

9.2.3 Rub

   Rubbing in Oceanic languages is roughly divisible into two semantic categories: rubbing in
which abrasion is to the fore, as for example in making a fire, and rubbing for the purpose of
making smooth. The generic term for abrasive rubbing was apparently POc _*usuq_, whilst
_*suka_ referred to friction to make a fire. The POc term for 'rub smooth' was _*quju(r)_,
_*qujur-i-_. Although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the reflexes of _*usuq_ and _*quju(r)_,
they were clearly separate verbs in POc. POc _*pulu_ evidently referred to rubbing in association
with washing.

9.2.4 Brush, sweep

   Of the verbs reconstructed below, POc _*salap_ refers to the action performed with a
broom, in Melanesia often made by tying together a bunch of palm-leaf midribs; POc _*sapu(r)_,
_*sapur-i-_ refers to brushing or wiping dirt or dust from something; and POc _*tapi_ meant
something similar to _*sapu(r)_, but perhaps with focus on the movement involved. We do not
have enough information about POc _*saRo_ to pin down its meaning.

9.3 Cutting, peeling, separating, splitting and tearing

   Prior to the introduction of steel blades, cutting of timber would have been achieved by
stone axe or adze (replaced with Tridacna shell blade when suitable stone was unobtainable),
and of softer materials by sharpened shell or piece of bamboo, or a piece of obsidian or flint.
In some languages, terms for the implement serve as a base for various cutting activities. For
instance, Iduna, a Papuan Tip language, has dozens of cutting terms which are compounds
with _-tala-_ 'chop, cut (of tree, boat), shave (of beard), peck (with beak)" a reflex of POc
_*taRa(q)_ 'adze'. They include:

__pre__
   -tala-kehi-            'cut small (of wood, with a knife)'
   -tala-kelikeli-        'cut long grooves or scratches (with knife)'
   -tala-kowa-            'take a cutting'
   -tala-kʷaili-          'take leaf out (of coconut frond)'
   -tala-kwane-kwane-     'cut one after another, chip at holding adze vertically'
   -tala-Iukuwe-          'cut into'
   -tala-muhu-muhu-       'cut into tiny pieces (of wood)'
   -tala-bwa?e-bwa?e-     'chip round marks with sharp edge of knife'
   -tala-dobo-            'break with knife (of food, wood)'
   -tala-done-            'cut into'
   -tala-golohi-          'cut off, chop off (branches), (cause to) tear by cutting'


The evidence suggests that _*taRa(q)_ 'adze' already had a corresponding verb _*taRaq-i-_, in
POc.

   The POc term for an obsidian blade was apparently _*koto_ (Ch. 4, §4.1.3) and this is used
as a verb in some languages. It is possible that the verb _*koti_ (§3.1) is derived from this, but
we cannot be sure.

  There are a large number of reconstruct able POc terms for 'cut' (and many more in
various smaller Oceanic groups). Some of these can be given a reasonably precise gloss,
whilst others we gloss simply as 'cut' as their more exact use is lost to us.


9.3.1 Cut off, sever

   A number of verbs referring to cutting something off or severing it can be reconstructed.
In some cases it is reasonably clear that they were distinguished by the kinds of object which
were cut. In other cases it is difficult to reconstruct semantic distinctions. Reconstructable
verbs are:

__pre__
POc  *utu(s), *utus-i-           'sever, separate'
POc  *kutu[-]                    'cut'
POc  *ma-utus, *motus            'become, be broken off, severed'
POc  *muju                       'be clipped off'
POc  *mujuki-                    'clip off (protruding growth close to the surface)'

   POc _*utu(s)_, _*utus-i-_ appears to have been a generic verb of severing or separating. POc
_*ma-utus_/_*motus_ does not strictly belong here, as it is an inceptive or stative verb, not a verb
of action. It is included because of its formal relationship with *utus and because there are
certain formal problems associated with POc _*utu(s)_, _*kutu_, _*ma-utus_ and _*muju_. The first
of these is that some of the reflexes attributed to _*utu(s)_ may in fact reflect _*kutu_ (this is
true, e.g., of Mangseng and Gumawana _utu_).

   In the following set, the occurrence of stative perfective glosses like 'torn', together with
the Nakanai form _*ma-utu_, points to a reconstruction derived by prefixing _*ma-_ to _*utus_
above: the function of _*ma-_ was to derive neutral (inceptive and stative) intransitive verbs
(Ch. 2, §3.1.2). The hypothesis that the form _*ma-utus_ occurred is supported by the derived
transitive Longgu, Sa'a _mousi_ below, but the widespread presence of reflexes of _*motus_
suggest that it occurred as an alternant in POc:

Note that the Malaita-Makira languages of SES have formed a new transitive verb _*motus-i-_
'break off' from the intransitive _*ma-utus_:

__pre__
   SES: Longgu      mousi-            'cut, break, pull in two; cut clean away, cut right off'

   SES: Lau         mūsi              (VT) 'tear, tear off, separate, sever, cut or break off'


   Although the forms attributed to POc _*muju_ 'be terminated' look remarkably similar to
those attributed to *ma-utus, the differences in form and meaning are consistent enough to
require a separate reconstruction:

good reflexes of PMP _*tabas_ (Ch. 2, §2.4), it is very rare to find two POc reflexes of a PMP

unable to explain this.

[3]   Blust (ACD) reconstructs PWMP _*tabas_ 'cut away underbrush'. The reconstruction of

Buru (CMP) _taha_ 'fell s.t., cut down s.t. that is standing vertically'.

9.3.3 Shape by cutting

   The two verbs below refer to cutting wood or shell to shape it or carve it in the production
of artefacts such as canoes or shell inlays in carvings.

   The reconstruction of POc _*sapʷi_, as distinct from _*sapi_ (§3.7), is justified by the semantic
contrast between the two sets, and by unambiguous reflexes of POc *_pʷ_ (Tawala, Dobu,

9.3.4 Incise the skin, circumcise

   The two verbs below referred to cutting into parts of the human body. The PEOc term

9.3.7 Separate flesh from shell, skin from fruit, bark from tree, leaves from branch or midrib

   This set of meanings is dealt with together because we often find Oceanic verbs with two
or more meanings from this list. That is, POc seems to have verbs whose meaning was
essentially 'separate one layer or part of an object from another', where the object was
usually a plant, fruit or vegetable.

   Not surprisingly, there is an overlap between these meanings and some of those of verbs in
other sections of this chapter. For example, POc _*kara(s)_, _*karas-i-_ 'peel or scrape skin off
tubers' (§2.2) and POc _*supi_ 'pare, shave, sharpen' (§3.6) also refer to peeling.

   We may divide the verbs in this subsection into three groups:

__ol__
1)    POc *kulit, *kulit-i- 'skin', derived from the noun *kulit in a way analogous to the English verb to skin;
2)    the three formally similar verbs *isi, *sisi and *Risi(q);
3)    verbs with meanings related to those in (2), namely:
      __pre__
      POc     *sali       'strip leaves from branch, frond'
      PEOc    *sapi       'strip (leaves); pluck (fruit, nuts)'
      POc     *papak      'peel bark'
      POc     *kati       'husk with the teeth'; PEOc *keti
      POc     *(p,pʷ)ili   'peel by hand (fruit, cooked food)'.

POc _*tosi_ 'score, split, pull apart lengthwise' is included here because it denotes an act
preparatory to the splitting of, e.g., pandanus leaves, an action denoted by reflexes of some
of the verbs listed above.

<

   The three items below have obvious formal and semantic similarities. The reconstructed
forms and meanings are:

__ul__
POc *isi[-]  'scoop out (flesh from coconut +); peel off (skin, bark +)'
POc *sisi[-] 'scoop out (flesh from coconut +); peel off (skin, bark +)'
POc *Risi(q) 'remove by tearing, tear or peel off (bark +) in long narrow strips'

  Blust (ACD) notes CMP cognates of POc _*isi_ (Roti _isi_ 'peel onion +, scale fish', Kei _isi(n)_
(VT) 'skin, peel off'), supporting the gloss 'peel off (skin, bark +)'. PAn had a noun _*isiʔ_
whose meanings included 'flesh (of humans, animals, fruits, tubers); contents; blade of a
knife; inhabitants'. It is possible that POc _*isi_, at least in its meaning 'scoop out (flesh from
coconut +)" was derived from this noun. Thus _*isi_ is fairly well supported by external
evidence, as well as the Oceanic reflexes listed below. Since coconut flesh is grated straight
out of the shell, the Molima and Nakanai reflexes are easily derived semantically from
'scoop out (flesh from coconut +)'.

   POc _*Risi(q)_ is also supported by external (Philippine) cognates with meanings associated
with tearing. POc _*sisi_ and _*isi_ are supported by CMP cognates. Since POc _*isi_ and _*sisi_
appear to be reconstructable with the same meaning, we suspect that the latter is simply
derived from the former by reduplication. However, several of their reflexes have glosses
associated with stripping bark from a tree, and we wonder whether there has been some
conflation with reflexes of _*Risi(q)_, which clearly meant 'remove by tearing, tear or peel off
(bark +) in long narrow strips' (in SES languages, reflexes of _*Risi(q)_ have undergone a
meaning shift to 'cut a piece off s.t.').

   Of the Polynesian reflexes, we have, on grounds of meaning, attributed Rennellese _isi_
'scoop, scrape (coconut meat from shell)' to  POc _*isi_ but Samoan _isi_ etc to  POc _*Risi(q)_.

   POc _*tosi_ was evidently used of the action of scoring something with a pointed instrument,
e.g. as a preliminary to splitting (i.e. _*Risi(q)_ above) pandanus leaves.

9.3.8 Split into two or more sections

   There are a number of verbs of splitting, apparently distinguished by the exact nature of
the action, which in tum is often dependent on the texture of the object being split. POc
_*(p,pʷ)olaq_/_*pʷalaq_ seems to have been the generic term for splitting or sometimes tearing
something into two. It was evidently the verb used of splitting a log for firewood. POc
_*potak_, _*potak-i-_ was the verb used of splitting something, e.g. a coconut, open. POc _*kakas_,
_*[ka]kas-i-_ and _*(p,pʷ)asi_ were perhaps more generic terms for 'split', but it is difficult to be
sure of this from the available reflexes. Its Longgu and Bauan reflexes suggest that POc
_*pisak_ may have referred to splitting wood finely. POc _*wakaq_ has few reflexes, but they
refer to splitting or cutting up items less hard than wood. Reflexes of POc _*Risi(q)_ (§3.7)
sometimes also mean 'split', but this was not its primary meaning.

The forms above suggest the following history. The POc form was (on MP evidence) _*polaq_.
Initial _*po-_ first became _*pʷo-_ through spread of lip-rounding from vowel to consonant, then
_*pʷo-_ dissimilated to _*pʷa-_. Either each of these forms occurred in the speech of the POc
community, or (less plausibly) independent parallel changes occurred in various daughter
languages. Bauan _bola_ also points to a POc doublet _*bolaq_ (Ch. 2, §3.1.3).

9.4 Penetration with a pointed object

9.4.1 Pierce

   The terms listed below entail formal and semantic overlaps to a seemingly embarassing
degree. However, there is evidence that all these terms occurred in POc: _*(su)suRi_ and
_*s(u,i)ri_, for example, are supported by the existence of contrasting reflexes in Mussau, _sui_
and _suli_. Reflexes of the first three are used to refer to sewing, but the POc verb which
specifically referred to that activity was none of these, but _*saqit_ (Ch.4, §3.2.1). POc _*(su)suRi_
and POc _*sua_ referred respectively to a bone needle (Ch.4, §3.2.1) and a spear (Ch. 8, §9),
but are included here because of their verbal uses and their potential for confusion with the
other terms.

9.4.2 Drill, bore

   Drilling or boring was performed by rotating a harder implement, e.g. one with a shark's
tooth head, on softer material. Reflexes of drilling terms are occasionally used of igniting a
fire by rotating one object against another. Five verbs of drilling and boring have been
reconstructed:

None of the first three reconstructions is particularly well supported by the evidence, and
their formal similarity leaves us questioning whether there is a derivational relationship
between them. However, the evidence does not at this stage allow us to combine them. They
all refer to actions which entail turning an instrument in order to make a hole.

9.5 Forceful impact

9.5.1 Hit, beat, strike

   A number of terms for hitting are reconstructable, with meanings which vary particularly
according to the manner of hitting, like English _clout_, _slap_, _punch_, _pound_, _knock_ and so on:

__pre__
POc *punu(q), *punuq-i-               'hit, strike, fight, kill'
POc *qubu, *qubʷi-                    'hit with fist or with a weapon'
POc *rapu(t), *raput-i-               'hit with hand or stick, slash'
POc *tutuk, *tuki[-]                  'pound, mash by pounding, hammer, crack by hammering'
POc *putu(k) and *butu(k), *butuk-i-  'repeatedly knock, pound, beat'
POc *qatu(ŋ), *qatuŋ-i-               'strike from above, pound'
POc *babak, *baki[ -]                 'strike one against another, knock'
POc *tupu, *tupu-i-                   'knock against, knock over, stub (toe), stumble against'
POc *pʷasa(r,R), *pʷasa(r,R)-i-       'slap, hit'
PWOc *sapu[-]                         'hit'
PCP *sau, *sauti-                     'strike, beat, chop'
PCP *(v,b)asu                         'a drum '; (V) 'drum, thump'

   The most general term for 'hit' in POc was _*punuq_, _*punuq-i-_, often used for striking
another person, sometimes with the extended meaning of fighting and/or killing them. Reflexes
of _*qubu_, _*qubu-i-_ and POc _*Ra(p,b)u(s)_, _*Ra(p,b)us-i-_ appear in very similar contexts to
those of _*punuq_, _*punuq-i-_, but there is some evidence that _*qubu_, _*qubu-i-_ may have
referred to striking with the fist or a weapon and better evidence that _*Ra(p,b)u(s)_, _*Ra(p,b)us-i-_
referred to striking hard with the hand or with a stick.

The morphological relationship between intransitive *qubu and transitive _*qubʷi-_ does not
conform to any of the patterns described in Chapter 2, §3.1.2. Transitive _*qubʷi-_ appears to
be derived from intransitive _*qubu_ plus transitive suffix _*-i-_, but intransitive roots ending in a
vowel other than _*-a-_ did not take the transitive suffix, so the history of this pair remains
unclear.

The mismatch in root-final consonants between PMP _*ra(m)buk_ and POc _*rapu(t)_ above
suggests that their resemblance may be due to chance. The SES items reflect medial _*-b-_
where reflexes in other language groups agree on _*-p-_, whilst the Guadalcanal-Gelic subgroup
of SES reflects a form _*(l,R)abu_, _*(l,R)abut-i-_.


   The items below, POc _*tutuk_, _*tuki-_ and _*putu(k)_/_*butu(k)_, _*butuk-i-_ are onomatopoeic,
with a basic reference to hammering, and are derivationally related.

9.5.2 Break, smash, shatter

    The first two reconstructions below, POc _*pʷosa(k)_, _*pʷosak-i-_ and POc _*pʷara(s)_,
_*pʷaras-i-_, refer to the breaking of brittle objects, among them the shell of an egg when a chick
hatches. It is possible that these were intransitive verbs in POc and that their subject was the
breaking object, e.g., the egg. POc _*(p,pʷ)oga(q)_ (VI) 'burst open, split open' and POc _*momo(k)_
'break into small pieces' similarly seem to have been intransitive, and the latter may also
have been used to refer to potsherds, crumbs, and so on.

    The remaining verbs in this subsection all appear to have been used transitively, with an
agent subject and a patient object. It is possible that the forms without final _*-i-_ were used
intransitively with the patient (rather than the agent) as their subject. That is, they meant
'break spontaneously' or 'be broken', belonging to the neutral verb class (Ch. 2, §3.1.1).

9.6 Removal of object from source by hand

9.6.1 Pluck, pick

   The verbs reconstructed in this subsection fall into two formal and semantic sets, according
to the PAn roots they reflect. Thus the first set reflects the PAn root _*-buC_ 'weed, pull,
pluck out' (Ch. 2, §3.1.3):

__pre__
POc *pupu(t), *puti                'pick (fruit +), pluck (feathers +)'
POc *sapu(t), *saput-i-            'pull out, pull up, pluck (fruit, nuts)'
POc *tapu(t), *taput-i             'strip (crops), pull off'

PPn _*lohu_ 'fruit-plucking pole, hook something with a pole' (Biggs 1993), probably also
reflects PAn _*-buC_ via an otherwise unattested POc _**loput_.

   The second set also seems to reflect a single PAn root, namely _*-pak_ 'break, crack, split',
although their POc meanings both refer to plucking leaves off a branch by hand. POc _*paki_
has only Fijian and Polynesian reflexes, but is reconstructed for POc on the basis of the
reconstructable PAn root:

__pre__
POc *sapaki                        'pluck off, break off (leaves) with the hand'

 POc _*puti-_ above bears a close formal resemblance to POc _*pʷuti[-] 'cut off' (§3.1), but we
reconstruct them separately on the basis of (i) the difference in initial correspondence sets (cf.
Ch. 2, §2.1) and (ii) the consistently different sets of meanings.

   The verb below appears to be derived from a noun PMP/POc _*kawit_ 'hook '. This noun
bears a remarkable resemblance to PMP/POc _*kawil_ 'hook, fish hook' (Ch. 8, §4), and we
take it that the latter may well represent an irregular offshoot of the former at some time in
the distant past.

9.7 Wringing and squeezing

   POc evidently had a substantial number of verbs used of squeezing or wringing something
to extract liquid. The substance to which this probably applied with the greatest frequency
was grated coconut which had been soaked in water, from which coconut 'cream' is
extracted by squeezing. The last two items listed here referred to squeezing something by
holding it tight. There are several formal overlaps among the items in this section, and these
are discussed below.

Blust (ACD) has also reconstructed PMP _*pe(R)cit_ and _*becit_, both 'squeeze, squirt out', from
which the items attributed to _*pos-i-_ could, on the face of it, alternatively be derived. However,
if PMP _*pe(R)cit_ or _*becit_ were the source of the Oceanic forms, we would expect the POc
pair _**posi(t)_, _**posit-i-_, and the latter is reflected nowhere. Instead, we can reconstruct the
pair _*popo(s)_ and _*posi-_, and it is accordingly more likely that the set above is derived from
the latter.

   Also reconstructable is PNNG _*(p,pʷ)isa(k)_, _*(p,pʷ)isak-i-_ 'squeeze (grated coconut +)'. It
seems probable that this is a reflex of POc _*pisa(k)_, _*pisak-i-_ 'split' (§3.8) which has undergone
a change in meaning (essentially from 'split a coconut to obtain its flesh' to 'squeeze the
coconut flesh to obtain its sap'). The partial formal similarity of this item to those above may
have abetted this shift.

It seems likely that in some languages reflexes of POc _*poRo(s)_ 'squeeze out, wring out
(liquid) and POc _*piro[-]_ 'twist together' or PEOc _*pilo(s)_, _*pilos-i-_ 'make a cord by twisting
fibres on the thigh' have been conflated. Thus the items below have meanings usually associated
with reflexes of _*poRo(s)_ but their forms reflect _*piro_ or _*pilo(s)_, _*pilos-i-_:

__pre__
   PT:    Iduna         vilo-             'twist, wring (of clothes)'
   SES:   Kwaio         filo, filo-       'squeeze, wring'

   Fij:   Wayan         vilo              'be squeezed and strained through a cloth, as in preparing kava or coconut cream; be wrung out, dried by wringing with the hands'
   Fij:   Wayan         vilooi-           'squeeze and strain s.t.; wring out wet clothes'

Note that the reflexes of _*poRos-i-_ above are all WOc, whilst those of _*pilos-i-_ are EOc. This
distribution suggests that conflation occurred in PEOc, with reflexes of POc _*piro[-]_ 'twist
together' and POc _*poRo(s)_ 'squeeze out, wring out (liquid) becoming conflated both formally
and semantically, giving rise to _pilos-i-_ in place of _*poRos-i-_.

   The derivational relationship between the pair of verbs below, PEOc _*gugu(m)_, _*gum-i-_
'grasp in fist, clench fist', evidently still subsists in some Pn languages. Although PEOc
_*gugu(m)_ is to our knowledge only reflected in Pn languages, this relationship persists and
must go back to PEOc and probably to POc. There is an obvious historical relationship
between this pair and Dempwolff's reconstruction of PMP _*gemgem_ 'make a fist', but the
reconstructable POc/PEOc vowel is 'wrong': _*u_ for expected _*o_.

>

    The vowel is also 'wrong' (except perhaps in the Arosi reflex) in the pair below, which,
despite its formal and semantic similarity to the pair above, seems to have a different PMP
origin. Similarity has apparently ensured that no language reflects both forms of each pair.
Indeed, I suspect that some forms above are historical conflations of reflexes of PEOc
_*gumi-_ and _*gumu_ (from POc _*gumu(t)_).

9.8 Twisting, plaiting, braiding

   The verbs in this section have to do with twisting, plaiting and braiding in general, and
more specifically with twisting or rolling fibres to make various kinds of string or cord. The
reflexes of some of these verbs overlap in their semantics with those in §7. Other verbs are
used of plaiting and weaving to make artefacts such as mats and baskets. They are the
following, presented in Chapter 4, §3.2:

Reduplication was regularly used to form intransitive verbs from verbs which were implicitly
transitive (Ch 2, §3.1.2).

   The two terms below have undoubtedly been conflated in some languages, but the data
justify separate reconstructions. With regard to the origin of PEOc _*pilo(s)_, _*pilos-i_, see the

9.9 Bending and folding

   Pn:  Maori            roku                'bend; to be weighed down'

The seeming PMP ancestor of this form is PMP _*lekuʔ_ 'bend, fold, folding part of the body'
(ACD), but this source is called into question by the root-final POc _*-t_ reflected in the Lou,
Sursurunga and Wayan items above.


9.10 Fastening and lashing together

   Terms for materials used for cordage or string are reconstructed in Chapter 4, §3.2. As
well as the verbs listed below, reflexes of POc _*patu(R)_, _*patuR-i-_ 'tie, plait, weave (mats,
baskets +)' (Ch. 4, §3.1.1) and POc verb _*saqi(t)_ 'sew' (Ch. 4, §3.2.1) are also used for tying.
This was evidently one of the POc meanings of the former, but probably not of the latter.
Other verbs for various kinds of tying are listed below. POc _*buku_ 'tie (a knot); fasten' was
probably a generic term for tying, whilst POc _*pʷita_ 'tie by encircling', POc _*paqu(s)_, _*paqus-i-_
'bind, lash; construct (canoe +) by tying together', and POc _*pisi_ 'bind up, tie up, wind round,
wrap' had more specialised meanings. There is insufficient information about POc _*kiti_ 'tie,
bind' to attribute a more specific meaning to it.

   The first POc verb reconstructed below is identical to POc _*buku_ 'node …' (Ch. 4, §3.2), a
noun which referred among other things to knots. It is possible that the verbs listed below
under _*buku_ are independent developments from the POc noun. However, since many POc
roots seem to have functioned as both noun and verb, we reconstruct the verb here.

   The second verb, _*bukuti_, is odd, in that it implies a PMP root _**bukut_, but the reconstructable
PMP form is _*buku_ (Ch. 4, §3.2) without final _*-t_. We assume that _*-t-_ was inserted by
analogy with other transitive verbs.

It is just possible that the item above is in fact identical to POc _*paus_, _*paus-i-_ 'weave, plait'
(Ch. 4, §3.1.1). Unfortunately, we have found no language in which reflexes of the two items
are in contrast. On the other hand, we find widely scattered reflexes with two separate sets of
glosses, 'weave, plait' and 'bind, lash, fasten', and it seems judicious to keep them apart.

[9]   This reconstruction is supported by Ngada _paʔu_ 'tie, bind' and the Oceanic reflexes listed here.

   The item below, POc _*kiti_ 'tie, bind', is reconstructed at POc level because it is fairly clear
that there was a PAn root _*-kit_. This, according to the theory of PAn monosyllabic roots
outlined in Ch. 2, §3.1.3, would have resulted in a PMP _**kit-kit_ 'tie, fasten' (as yet not
directly attested), and this in its turn would have given rise to POc _**kiki(t)_ and _*kit-i-_, of
which only the latter is attested:

9.11 Applying heat and burning

   POc had a number of verbs expressing the various ways in which heat can be applied. The
reflexes of some of these, like POc _*mʷaRi_ 'roast, burn' (Ch. 6, §3.2), are used almost
exclusively in the context of cooking, and are therefore presented in Chapter 6. The reflexes
of others, like POc _*tunu_ 'roast, burn' (Ch. 6, §3.2), POc _*raraŋ_, _*raraŋ-i-_ 'warm s.t./s.o.'
(Ch. 4, §3.1.1), and POc _*sunu_ 'singe' (Ch. 6, §3.6), are used both for cooking and for other
kinds of heat application, and so are given here with reduced cognate sets. Two further terms,
POc _*soko(t)_, _*sokot-i-_ 'burn (grass +)' and POc _*tutu(ŋ)_, _*tuŋi_ 'light, set fire to', were used
for burning but apparently did not apply to cookery.

[10]   Given the two reconstructable POc forms, this appears to be a case of Blust's (1977) paradigm (Ch. 2,
     §3.1.2), suggesting that the PMP form was _*daŋdaŋ_.

[11] If the Oceanic forms are an example of the usual canon, we would expect PMP _*tuŋtuŋ_.

                                              collation



                     1           Introduction
                       Data sources which were consulted in relation to a particular terminology are noted in
                    the chapter on that terminology. However, quite a wide range of sources was consulted in
                    the construction of the data base and we list these here, rather than repeating them in each
                    chapter. Sources are conveniently divided into published and unpublished. In alphabetical
                    sequence of language, published sources are:

   Unpublished sources consisted of manuscript word lists for Molima and Nakanai by
Ann Chowning, for Tamambo (=Malo) by Dorothy Jauncey, and computer files provided
by a number of scholars, some of which are themselves based on a variety of primary
sources. These files include:
•     The computer files of lexical data collated during the research leading to the publication
      of Ross (1988), whose sources are listed in Appendices A and B of that work.
•     The computer files from the Comparative Austronesian Dictionary project which
      resulted in Tryon ed. (1995), which lists its own sources.
•     The computer files of Robert Blust's Austronesian Comparative Dictionary on disk at
      the University of Hawaii. The version to which we refer dates from 1995.
•     The computer files of Bruce Biggs' POLLEX: Proto Polynesian lexicon on disk at the
      University of Auckland. The version to which we refer dates from December 1993.
•     Computer files of reconstructions with supporting cognate sets for North/Central Vanuatu
      (Clark 1994), Southern Vanuatu (Lynch 1996b), and Micronesian (Bender et al. 1983).
•     Computer files of dictionaries in progress provided by Joel Bradshaw (for Numbami),
      Debbie Hill (for Longgu) and Malcolm Ross (for Takia).
•     Computer files of dictionaries in progress kindly made available by members of the
      Summer Institute of Linguistics. Languages and those who compiled/supplied the
      dictionary are as follows: Bing (Doug Bennett), Mapos Buang (Bruce Hooley), Iduna

2 Collation
   The collation stage of the project consisted in the first instance of creating a database of
vocabulary materials in a defined set of semantic domains from Oceanic languages for
which data were already available (see § 1 ). This database was kept in text files on Macintosh
computers. Files were organised in accordance with a modified version of the Summer
Institute of Linguistics' 'standard format' in which fields within each record are labelled
with an initial backslash followed by a single letter. In our version of the format, each
record was terminated with a carriage return, i.e. each record occupied a single line. Each
record contained a single word in a single language with associated information (a code
relating to the language's subgroup, a gloss and any other semantic information, the source,
and any other notes the researcher chose to add). The Macintosh allowed non-standard
characters to be created and viewed on screen. Records were organised on screen into
putative cognate sets. The use of text files rather than files in a proprietary database format
meant (i) that it was easy to view them on screen; (ii) that it was easy to manipulate them
with a variety of text editors and word processors; (iii) that more complex repetitive processes
could be performed by writing small programs in the Icon programming language (Griswold
& Griswold 1990); and (iv) that it was relatively easy to import and reformat other people's
data sets and to export collated material into publications in preparation.
   Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages
from which data are cited here, all data were transcribed at the collation stage into a standard
orthography (see Ross 1988 :3-4) to enable us to recognise cognates and to spot regular
changes more quickly. This orthography is retained in the citation of data in these volumes.
         Appendix 2: Languages


1. Introduction
    Maps 6- 10, showing location of languages referred to in the volume, are included at the
end of Appendix 2. In §2 we list these languages in their putative subgroups . The higher-order
subgroups are those described in Ch. 1 , §3.2. Lower-order groups, except where indicated,
are drawn from the classification in Lynch, Ross and Crowley (2002), and also, for
Western Oceanic, from Ross (1988). In §3 we provide an index to §2. Polynesian subgrouping
is based on Marck (forthcoming).

   Square brackets enclose the subgroup abbreviations used in the data. Parentheses include
dialect names or, where an equals sign is used, an alternative name or names for the
language.

         Index

    This index lists all forms reconstructed in this volume, together with any existing higher-level
proto forms. Reconstructions for proto languages of lower order than Proto Oceanic are
included when significant to the discussion, or innovatory to their antecedent in some way.
Other reconstructed forms listed here are those which have been used to illustrate particular
points of phonology or derivation.
    Reconstructions are listed by proto language from highest-order to lowest, and in a rough
geographical sequence from west to east. Within each proto language, reconstructions are
listed in alphabetical order, with the following additions:
    n is followed by n , ŋ                     s is followed by S
   r is followed by R
   Parentheses and hyphens are ignored in alphabetisation. When a reconstruction contains
parenthesised alternants, e.g. *(b,p)ulit, only the first alternant is counted for alphabetisation
purposes.

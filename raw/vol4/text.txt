1 Introduction

Map 1:   The Austronesian language family and major subgroups

1.1 Aims

This is the fourth in a series of volumes on the lexicon of the Proto Oceanic (POc) language.[1]
POc is the immediate ancestor of the Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian language family.
This subgroup consists of all the Austronesian languages of Melanesia east of 136° E,
together with those of Polynesia and (with two exceptions) those of Micronesia—more than
450 languages in all (see Map 1).[2] Extensive arguments for the existence of Oceanic as a
clearly demarcated branch of Austronesian were first put forward by Otto Dempwolff in the
1920s, and the validity of the subgroup is now recognised by virtually all scholars working
in Austronesian historical linguistics.

     The development and break-up of the POc language and speech community were stages in
a truly remarkable chapter in human prehistory—the colonisation by Austronesian speakers
of the Indo-Pacific region in the period after about 2000 BC. The outcome was the largest
of the world’s well-established language families and (until the expansion of Indo-European
after Columbus) the most widespread. The Austronesian family comprises more than 1,000
distinct languages. Its eastern and western outliers, Madagascar and Easter Island, are two-thirds
of a world apart, and its northernmost extensions, Hawai‘i and Taiwan, are separated
by 70 degrees of latitude from its southernmost outpost, Stewart Island in New Zealand. It is
likely that the divergence of Oceanic from its nearest relatives, which are the Austronesian
languages spoken around Cenderawasih Bay and in South Halmahera (Blust 1978a), began
when Austronesian speakers from the Cenderawasih Bay area moved eastwards along the
north coast of New Guinea and into the Bismarck Archipelago. There is a strong school of
opinion that associates the subsequent break-up of POc with the rapid colonisation of Island
Melanesia and the central Pacific by bearers of the Lapita culture between about 1200 and
 900 BC (see Map 2 and volume 2, chapter 2).

Map 2:   Geographic limits of historically known Oceanic speakers and of presently documented Lapita sites (after Kirch_1997:17, 54)

[1] The project has been jointly directed by Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross, with research assistance from
 Meredith Osmond, in the Department of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University. Originally, five volumes were planned, but the large amount of material has required
 this to be increased to seven (see p2).

[2] The listing in Tryon (1995) contains 466 Oceanic languages, many of which are subdivisible into dialects.

2   Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


     The present project aims to bring together a large corpus of lexical reconstructions for
POc, with supporting cognate sets, organised according to semantic fields and using a standard
orthography for POc. We hope that this thesaurus will be a useful resource for culture
historians, archaeologists and others interested in the prehistory of the Pacific region. The
comparative lexical material should also be a rich source of data for various kinds of purely
linguistic research, e.g. on semantic change and subgrouping in the more than 400 daughter
languages.

     Volume 1 of The lexicon ofProto Oceanic deals with material culture. Volumes 2, 3 and 4
examine relevant sets of cognate terms in order to gain insights into how POc speakers viewed
and exploited their environment. Volume 2 deals with the geophysical or inanimate environment,
volume 3 treats plants and the present volume animals. Volume 5, as it is planned at
the time of writing, will investigate terminologies centring on people, including the body
and human conditions and activities, and volume 6 will concern social organisation, belief
systems, rituals, recreation and other elements of non-material culture. The seventh and final
volume will perform a number of functions. It will treat certain lexical categories, e.g. closed
classes of lexical roots, not dealt with in earlier volumes. It will review the main findings
of the project concerning the culture and environment of Proto Oceanic speakers and will
compare these findings with what archaeology tells us about the way of life and environment
of the bearers of the Lapita culture. Volume 7 will also provide an index to the POc and other
reconstructions presented in the whole work, as well as an English-to-POc finderlist and a
list of all languages cited, together with their subgroups.[3]

     The major headings under which animals are divided in this volume, e.g. Fish, Birds,
Aquatic invertebrates, etc., largely follow English-language rather than Oceanic categories.
There are several reasons for this choice. One is that descriptions of Oceanic taxonomies
of animals are few and imperfect. Another is that although the best-described Oceanic taxonomies
typically agree with one another in some respects, they vary in others. Yet another
is that we assume that readers would be more likely to look, say, for ‘bats’ under Mammals
than under Birds.

     In keeping with the exceptionally rich diversity of marine fauna in Oceania and its
economic and cultural importance to Oceanic societies, three (chapters 2-4) of the
seven chapters that follow this introduction are largely devoted to creatures of the sea, as are portions of
two others (chapters 5 and 8). Chapters 2 and 3 both concern fish terminologies. Chapter 2
presents supporting cognate sets for more than 140 POc fish names and for many additional
names attributable to other major interstages below POc. A good many of the names are identifiable
at the level of genus or species, others only to family or class. Chapter 3 investigates
the retention rates of a sample of 52 POc fish names and asks why the total number of fish
names reconstructed for POc is so much smaller than the number typically distinguished by
contemporary Oceanic languages. Chapter 4 presents reconstructions of terms for aquatic
invertebrates and their body parts. Chapter 5 examines terms for mammals, reptiles and
amphibians. Again it is partly about creatures of the sea. Other than New Guinea, the islands
of Oceania have few native land mammals. Chapter 6 deals with names for bird taxa and
other terms associated with birds. Chapter 7 is entitled ‘Insects and other creepy-crawlies’,
the latter including non-insect terrestrial invertebrates: spiders, centipedes, worms, leeches
and grubs. The final chapter of the volume, chapter 8, investigates the semantic histories
of several terms that may have been high-level generics or life-forms in the POc taxonomy
of animals. It looks for recurrent patterns in the way different languages have extended or
reduced the referential range of each of these terms.

[3] This Introduction incorporates much of the material in the Introductions to Volume 1, 2 and 3. We replicate
 this material here in order that each volume can be used independently. The introduction to volume 3, however,
 introduced a fresh presentation of the subgrouping of Oceanic languages, and this is retained here.

1.2 The relation of the current project to previous work

Reconstructions of POc phonology and lexicon began with Dempwolff’s pioneering work in
the 1920s and 1930s. Dempwolff’s dictionary of reconstructions attributed to Proto Austronesian
(PAn) (1938) — but equivalent in modern terms to Proto Malayo-Polynesian (PMP)
— contains some 600 reconstructions with reflexes in Oceanic languages.

     Since the 1950s, POc and other early Oceanic interstage languages have been the subject
of a considerable body of research. However, relatively few new reconstructions safely
attributable to POc were added to Dempwolff’s material until the 1970s. In 1969 George Grace
made available as a working paper a compilation of reconstructions from various sources
amounting to some 700 distinct items, attributed either to POc or to early Oceanic interstages.
These materials were presented in a new orthography for POc, based largely on Biggs’
(1965) orthography for an interstage he called Proto Eastern Oceanic. Updated compilations
of Oceanic cognate sets were produced at the University of Hawai‘i in the period 1977-1983
as part of a project directed by Grace and Pawley. These compilations and the supporting
data are problematic in various respects and we have made only limited use of them.

    Comparative lexical studies have been carried out for several lower-order subgroups of
Oceanic: for Proto Polynesian by Biggs (resulting in Walsh & Biggs 1966, Biggs et al. 1970
and subsequent versions of the pollex file, including Biggs & Clark (1993) and Clark &
Biggs (2006); for Proto Micronesian by scholars associated with the University of Hawai‘i
(Bender et al. 1983, Bender et al. 2003); for the ancestor of the Banks and Torres languages by
Alexandre François (several unpublished manuscripts); for Proto North and Central Vanuatu
by Clark (1996, 2009); for Proto Southern Vanuatu by Lynch (1978, 1996b, 2001); for New
Caledonia by Ozanne-Rivierre (1992), Haudricourt & Ozanne-Rivierre (1982) and Geraghty
(1989); for Proto Southeast Solomonic by Levy (1980) and Lichtenberk (1988); for Proto Central
Pacific by Hockett (1976), Geraghty (1983, 1986, 1996 together with a number of unpublished papers);
for Proto Eastern Oceanic by Biggs (1965), Cashmore (1969), Levy & Smith
(1970), and Geraghty (1990); and for Proto Central Papuan by Pawley (1975), Lynch (1978, 1980),
and Ross (1994a).

    Robert Blust of the University of Hawai‘i has, in a series of papers (1970, 1980, 1983-84, 1986, 1989)
published extensive, alphabetically ordered, lexical reconstructions
(with supporting cognate sets) for interstages earlier than POc, especially for Proto Austronesian, Proto
Malayo-Polynesian and Proto Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. He has also written several papers
investigating specific semantic fields (Blust 1980b, 1982, 1987, 1994). Blust has a major
work in progress, the Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (ACD), which will bring together
all his reconstructions for Proto Austronesian and lower-order stages. This is stored in
electronic form at the University of Hawai‘i. The version to which we refer dates from 1995.

4   Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


    Several papers predating our project systematically investigated particular semantic domains
in the lexicon of POc, e.g. Milke (1958), French-Wright (1983), Pawley (1982a, 1985),
Pawley & Green (1985), Lichtenberk (1986), Walter (1989), and the various papers in
Pawley & Ross (1994). Ross (1988) contains a substantial number of new POc lexical reconstructions,
as well as proposed modifications to the reconstructed POc sound system and the
orthography. However, previous Oceanic lexical studies were limited both by large gaps in
the data, with a distinct bias in favour of ‘Eastern Oceanic’ languages, and by the technical
problems of collating large quantities of data. Although most languages in Melanesia remain
poorly described, there are now many more dictionaries and extended word lists, particularly
for Papua New Guinea, than there were in the 1980s. And developments in computing
hardware and software now permit much faster and more precise handling of data than was
possible then. A list of sources and a summary of the Project’s collation procedures is found
in Appendix 1.

    Several compilations of reconstructions have provided valuable points of reference, both
inside and outside the Oceanic group. We are indebted particularly to Bender et al. (2003),
two editions of pollex (Biggs & Clark 1993 and Clark & Biggs 2006), Blust (ACD), Clark (2009)
and Lynch (2001c).

    In the course of planning the several volumes for the present project, we came to realise
that the form in which preliminary publications were presented—namely as essays, each
discussing cognate sets for a particular semantic field at some length—would also be the
best form for the presentation of our final synthesis. A discursive treatment of individual
terminologies, as opposed, say, to a dictionary-type listing of reconstructions with supporting
cognate sets, makes it easier to relate the linguistic comparisons to relevant issues of culture
history, language change, and methodology. Hence each of the present volumes has as its core
a collection of analytic essays. Some of these have been published or presented elsewhere,
but are printed here in revised form. In some cases we have updated the earlier versions
in the light of subsequent research, and, where appropriate, have inserted cross-references
between contributions. Authorship is in some cases something of a problem, as a number of
people have had a hand in collating the data, doing the reconstructions, and (re)writing for
publication here. In most chapters, however, one person did the research which determined
the structure of the terminology, and that person appears as the first or only author, and where
another or others had a substantial part in putting together the paper itself, they appear as the
second and further authors.


1.3 Reconstructing the lexicon

The lexical reconstructions presented in these volumes are arrived at using the standard methods
of comparative linguistics, which require as preliminaries a subgrouping or internal
classification of the languages in question (§3.2) and the working out of systematic sound
correspondences among cognate vocabulary in contemporary languages (§3.3). As well as cognate
sets clearly attributable to POc, we have included some cognate sets which at this stage are
attributable to various interstage languages, particularly Proto Western and Proto Eastern
Oceanic (but see §3.2 for definitions). We have set out to pay more careful attention to
reconstructing the semantics of POc forms than has generally been done in earlier work, treating
words not as isolates but as parts of terminologies.

                                                                               Introduction    5


1.3.1 Terminological reconstruction

Our method of doing ‘terminological reconstruction’ is as follows. First, the terminologies
of present-day speakers of Oceanic languages are used as the basis for constructing a
hypothesis about the semantic structure of a corresponding POc terminology, taking account of
(i) ethnographic evidence, i.e. descriptions of the lifestyles of Oceanic communities and (ii)
the geographical and physical resources of particular regions of Oceania. For example, by
comparing terms in several languages for parts of an outrigger canoe, or for growth stages
of a coconut, one can see which concepts recur and so are likely to have been present in
POc. Secondly, a search is made for cognate sets from which forms can be reconstructed to
match each meaning in this hypothesised terminology. The search is not restricted to members
of the Oceanic subgroup; if a term found in an Oceanic language proves to have external (non-Oceanic)
cognates, the POc antiquity of that term will be confirmed and additional
evidence concerning its meaning will be provided. Thirdly, the hypothesised terminology is
re-examined to see if it needs modification in the light of the reconstructions. There are cases,
highlighted in the various contributions to these volumes, where we were able to reconstruct
a term where we did not expect to do so and conversely, often more significantly, where we
were unable to reconstruct a term where we had believed we should be able to. In each case,
we have discussed the reasons why our expectations were not met and what this may mean
for Oceanic culture history.

    Blust (1987: 81) distinguishes between conventional ‘semantic reconstruction’, which
asks, “What was the probable meaning of protomorpheme X?”, and Dyen and Aberle’s (1974)
‘lexical reconstruction’, where one asks, “What was the protomorpheme which probably
meant ‘X’?” At first sight, it might appear that terminological reconstruction is a version
of lexical reconstruction. However, there are sharp differences. Lexical reconstruction applies
a formal procedure: likely protomeanings are selected from among the glosses of words
in available cognate sets, then an algorithm is applied to determine which meaning should
be attributed to each set. This procedure may have unsatisfactory results, as Blust points out.
Reconstructions may end up with crude and overly simple glosses; or no meaning may be
reconstructed for a form because none of the glosses of its reflexes is its protomeaning.

     Terminological reconstruction is instead similar to the semantic reconstruction approach.
In terminological reconstruction the meanings of protomorphemes are not determined in advance.
Instead, cognate sets are collected and their meanings are compared with regard to:

__block__
- their specific denotations, where these are known;
- the geographic and genetic distribution of these denotations (i.e. are the glosses from which the protogloss is reconstructed well distributed?);
- any derivational relationships to other reconstructions;
- their place within a working hypothesis of the relevant POc terminology (e.g., are terms complementary —‘bow’ implies ‘arrow’; ‘seine net’ implies ‘floats’ and ‘weights’? Are there different levels of classification—generic, specific, and so on?).

For example, it proved possible to reconstruct the following POc terms for tying with cords
(vol.1, ch.9, §10):

__block__
- POc _*buku_ ‘tie (a knot); fasten’
- POc _*pʷita_ ‘tie by encircling’
- POc *paqu(s), _*paqus-i-_ ‘bind, lash; construct (canoe +) by lashing together’
- POc _*pisi_ ‘bind up, tie up, wind round, wrap’
- POc _*kiti_ ‘tie, bind’

6   Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


     In each of the supporting cognate sets from contemporary languages there are a number of
items whose glosses in the dictionaries or word lists are too vague to tell the analyst anything
about the specific denotation of the item, and in the case of _*kiti_ this prevents the assignment
of a more specific meaning. The verb _*buku_ can be identified as the generic term for tying
a knot because of its derivational relationship (by zero derivation) with a noun whose denotation
is clearly generic, _*buku_ ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in
wood, string or rope’ (vol.1, ch.4, §3.2). Reconstruction of the meaning of _*pʷita_ as ‘tie by
encircling’ is supported by the meanings of the Lukep, Takia and Longgu reflexes, respectively
‘tie by encircling’, ‘tie on (as grass-skirt)’, and ‘trap an animal’s leg; tie s.t. around
ankle or wrist’: Lukep and Takia are North New Guinea languages, whilst Longgu is SE
Solomonic. Reconstruction of the meaning of _*paqu(s)_, _*paqus-i-_ as ‘bind, lash; construct
(canoe +) by tying together’ is supported by the meanings of the Takia, Kiribati and Samoan
reflexes, respectively ‘tie, bind; construct (a canoe)’, ‘construct (canoe, house)’, and ‘make,
construct (wooden objects, canoes +)’: Takia is a North New Guinea language, Kiribati is
Micronesian, and Samoan is Polynesian. The meaning of _*pisi_ is similarly reconstructed by
reference to the meanings of its Mono-Alu, Mota, Port Sandwich, Nguna and Fijian reflexes.

     Often, however, the authors have been less fortunate in the information available to them.
For example, Osmond (vol.1, ch.8, §9) reconstructs six POc terms broadly glossed as ‘spear’.
Multiple terms for implements within one language imply that these items were used extensively
and possibly in specialised ways. Can we throw light on these specialised ways?
Unfortunately, some of the word lists and dictionaries available give minimal glosses, e.g.
‘spear’, for reflexes of the six reconstructions. What we need to know for each reflex is: what
is the level of reference? Is it a term for all spears, or perhaps all pointed projectiles including
arrows and darts? Or does it refer to a particular kind of spear? Is it noun or verb or both? If
a noun, does it refer to both the instrument and the activity? Most word lists are frustratingly
short on detail. For this kind of detail, ethnographies have proved a more fruitful source of
information than many word lists.

     Another problem is inherent in the dangers of sampling from over 450 languages. The
greater the number of languages, the greater are the possible variations in meaning of any
given term, and the greater the chances of two languages making the same semantic leaps
quite independently. Does our (sometimes quite limited) cognate set provide us with a clear
unambiguous gloss, or have we picked up an accidental bias, a secondary or distantly related
meaning? Did etymon x refer to fishhook or the material from which the fishhook was made?
Did etymon y refer to the slingshot or to the action of turning round and round?


1.3.2 Subgrouping and reconstruction

1.3.2.1 Subgrouping

Although the subgrouping of Austronesian languages, and hypotheses about which protolanguage
was spoken where, remain in certain cases somewhat controversial, it is impossible
to proceed without making some assumptions about these matters. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 are
approximate renderings of our subgrouping assumptions. The upper part of the tree, shown in
Figure 1.1, is due to Blust, originally presented in Blust (1977b) and repeated with additional
supporting evidence in subsequent publications (1978, 1982, 1983-84, 1993, 2009a).[4][5] The diagram
of the lower (Oceanic) part of the tree in Figure 1.2 shows nine primary subgroups of
Oceanic. Its rake-like structure indicates that no convincing body of shared innovations has
been found to allow any of the nine subgroups to be combined into higher-order groupings.
Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 offer some commentary on our subgrouping, and in §3.2.4 we
explain how we handle the rake-like structure in making reconstructions.

1.3.2.2 Kinds of subgroup

In Figures 1.1 and 1.2 each node is either a single language,[5] usually a reconstructed
protolanguage, or, in italics, a group of languages.


[4] For critical overviews of the literature on Austronesian subgrouping, see Ross (1995b), Adelaar (2005) and
 Blust (2009a). The CEMP and Central Malayo-Polynesian linkages, and also PEMP, have been called into
 question recently, but these issues lie beyond our present scope (Blust 2009b, Donohue & Grimes 2008, Ross
 20086).

[5] The two very closely related languages Mussau and Tench form a minor exception.

                                                                                              Introduction       9


    Where a node is a protolanguage, its descendants form a proper subgroup (in the technical
sense in which historical linguists use the term ‘subgroup’). A proper subgroup is identified
by innovations shared by its member languages, i.e. it is ‘innovation-defined’ in the terminology
of Pawley & Ross (1995). These innovations are assumed to have occurred just once in
the subgroup’s protolanguage, i.e. the exclusively shared ancestor of its members. Thus languages
of the large Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian share a set of innovations relative to
the earlier Austronesian stages shown in Figure 1.1 (Dempwolff 1934).[6] By inference these
innovations occurred in their common ancestor, POc, and the claim that they are innovations
is based on a comparison of reconstructed POc with reconstructed PMP The innovations may
be phonological (e.g. PMP *e, pronounced [ə], and PMP _*aw_ both became POc *o), morphological
(e.g. POc acquired a morphological distinction between three kinds of possessive
relationship: food, drink and default), or lexical (e.g. PMP _*limaw_ ‘citrus fruit’ was replaced
by POc *molis).

    Italics are used in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 to indicate a group of languages which is not a
proper subgroup, i.e. has no identifiable exclusively shared parent. Thus Formosan languages
in Figure 1.1 indicates a collection of languages descended (along with PMP) from PAn.
They are spoken in Taiwan, but do not form a subgroup. There was no ‘Proto Formosan’, as
Formosan languages and language groups are all descended directly from PAn.

    Some of the italicised labels in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 include the term linkage. A linkage
(an ‘innovation-linked group’ in the terminology of Pawley & Ross 1995) is a collection
of usually quite closely related languages or dialects,[7] speakers of which were in sufficient
contact at one time or another during their history for innovations to pass from one language
to the next, often resulting in a pattern such that the domains of various innovations overlap
but are not coterminous.[8] A number of Oceanic linkages were recognised during the 1980s
(Geraghty 1983, Pawley & Green 1984, Ross 1988).[9] A linkage may arise in at least three
ways, but distinguishing between them is often impossible.

    First, what would otherwise be a proper subgroup may happen to lack exclusively shared
innovations, perhaps because the parent did not exist as a unit for long enough to undergo
any innovations of its own.[10]

    Second, a linkage may consist of some but not all of the languages descended from a
single parent. The Western Oceanic linkage reflects the innovations of POc, but no innovation
is common to the whole of Western Oceanic (although the merger of POc _*r_ and _*R_ comes
close). However, the languages of its three component linkages—North New Guinea, Papuan
Tip and Meso-Melanesian—display complex patterns of overlapping innovations. The Western Oceanic
linkage appears to be descended from the dialects of POc that were left behind
in the Bismarck Archipelago after speakers of the languages ancestral to the other eight
primary subgroups in Figure 1.2 had moved away to the north or east. After these departures
various innovations occurred. Each arose somewhere in the Western Oceanic dialect network
and spread to neighbouring dialects without reaching every dialect in the network.

[6] Chapter 4 of Lynch et al. (2002) gives a recent account of these innovations.

[7] In what follows, ‘language’ is used to mean ‘language or dialect’.

[8] One or more innovations may spread right across the languages of the linkage. In this case it becomes virtually
 impossible to distinguish it from a proper subgroup.

[9] Recent work in Indo-European appeals to the concept of linkage: Garrett (2006) suggests that the dialects
 ancestral to Greek were not dialects of ‘Proto Greek’ but a collection of Nuclear Indo-European dialects drawn
 together by relations between the communities ancestral to the Greek city states, across which spread the innovations which characterise Ancient Greek.

[10] A situation in which a subgroup is both proper (i.e. defined by exclusive innovations) and a linkage (displaying
overlapping patterns of innovations) is of course possible, the exclusively shared innovations having occurred
in the parent, the others after the break-up of the parent. It so happens that we have no need of this construct
here.

10 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


    The third type of linkage is the result of contact among languages descended from more
than one immediate parent, indicated in Figure 1.2 by a dashed line around the relevant groups
of languages. An example is the Fijian linkage, which represents the partial resynthesis of the
Fiji-based descendants of earlier Western Central Pacific and Eastern Central Pacific linkages
after Rotuman and Polynesian had split off from them (Geraghty & Pawley 1981, Geraghty
1983, Pawley 1996c).[11] Geraghty reconstructed the history of the Fijian linkage by painstaking
analysis of innovations from at least two stages in its history. From the earlier period
Western Fijian languages share innovations with Rotuman and Eastern Fijian with Polynesian.
From a more recent period Western Fijian and Eastern Fijian languages share innovations
with each other, reflecting their reintegration into a single linkage, within which the present
Western/Eastem boundary has shifted relative to the (fuzzy) boundary of the earlier period.

    For most of the linkages noted in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 this kind of analysis is not available.
For example, Blust (1993) indicates that CEMP was a linkage. But its history is far from clear.
Does CEMP perhaps include some languages that share history with languages to their west
and others that share history with those to their north? The North/Central Vanuatu linkage,
long assumed to be some sort of genealogical unit, appears to reflect the partial reintegration
of at least two dialect networks, North Vanuatu and Central Vanuatu, that probably had not
diverged greatly from each other, but the details of this history are difficult to elucidate (Lynch
2000c).[12]

    The languages of a linkage have no identifiable exclusively shared parent. Yet we have
found many instances in which a cognate set is limited to one of the linkages in Figures 1.1
and 1.2: CEMP, Western Oceanic, New Guinea Oceanic, Southern Oceanic or the reintegrated
North and Central Vanuatu linkage. As with PEOc and Proto Remote Oceanic (§3.2.4), we think it is preferable
to attribute these reconstructions to a hypothetical protolanguage rather than to a higher node
in the tree. Hence there are reconstructions labelled PCEMP, PWOc and so on. Again these
apparent lexical innovations offer only the weakest evidence for the protolanguage to which
they are attributed. In addition to the explanations of the kinds offered for PEOc and Proto Remote Oceanic
etyma in §3.2.4 it is possible, for example, that an innovatory ‘PWOc’ etymon arose when the
Western Oceanic dialect network was still close-knit, and spread from dialect to dialect before
the network broke into the two networks ancestral to its present-day first-order subgroups.


1.3.2.3 Further notes on subgroups

This section brings together brief notes on the subgroups in Figure 1.2 beyond those mentioned
in the discussion in §3.2.2.

    Admiralty is a proper subgroup (Ross 1988: ch.9).

    Western Oceanic consists of the North New Guinea (NNG), Papuan Tip (PT),
MesoMelanesian (MM) linkages and the Sarmi/Jayapura (SJ) group (see Map 4). The last-named
may belong to the NNG linkage, but this is uncertain (Ross 19967?). It is not shown in
Figure 1.2 and its languages do not play a crucial role in reconstruction. It is likely that the NNG
and PT groups form a super-group, the New Guinea Oceanic linkage, and so etyma reflected
only in NNG and PT languages are attributed to a putative Proto New Guinea Oceanic (Milke
1958, Pawley 1978), and etyma reflected in either NNG or PT (or both) and in MM are labelled PWOc.

[11] ‘Eastern Fijian languages’ in Figure 1.2 is our label for Geraghty’s (1983) ‘Tokalau Fijian’.

[12] For a history of scholarly views of the subgrouping of North and Central Vanuatu languages see Clark
 (2009: §1.3). For arguments supporting a NCV grouping, see Clark (2009: ch.4).

Map 3: Groups of Oceanic languages used in cognate sets

12 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond

    SE Solomonic was established as a proper subgroup by Pawley (1972: 98-110). Further
support was provided by Levy (1979, 1980, n. d,), Tryon & Hackman (1983) and Lichtenberk
(1988).

     Temotu comprises the languages of the Reef Islands, Santa Cruz, Utupua and Vanikoro,
located 400 km east of the main Solomons archipelago and to the north of Vanuatu (Map 3).
It was established as a proper subgroup by (Ross & Nᴂss 2007).

    The Southern Oceanic linkage as proposed by Lynch (1999, 2000, 2001, 2004) is characterised
by complex overlapping innovations, but by none that are reflected in all its member languages
and would qualify it as a proper subgroup (see discussion in Lynch et al. 2002: 112-114).[13]

    Micronesian is a proper subgroup (Jackson 1983, 1986, Bender et al. 2003).

    Central Pacific is a proper subgroup, but one defined by only a handful of shared innovations,
indicating that the period of unity was short (Geraghty 1996). The high-order subgrouping of
Central Pacific is due to Geraghty (1983), except for the position of Rotuman,
due to Pawley (1996c). Within Central Pacific is another long recognised proper subgroup,
Polynesian, for which Pawley (1996a) lists diagnostic innovations.

1.3.2.4 Criteria for reconstruction

The strength of a lexical reconstruction rests crucially on the distribution of the supporting
cognate set across subgroups. The distribution of cognate forms and agreements in their
meanings is much more important than the number of cognates. It is enough to make a secure
reconstruction if a cognate set occurs in just two languages in a family, with agreement in
meaning, provided that the two languages belong to different primary subgroups and provided
that there is no reason to suspect that the resemblances are due to borrowing or chance.
The PMP term _*apij_ ‘twins’ is reflected in several western Malayo-Polynesian languages
(e.g. Batak apid ‘twins, double (fused) banana’) but only a single Oceanic reflex is known,
namely Roviana avisi ‘twins of the same sex’. Because Roviana belongs to a different first-
order branch of Malayo-Polynesian from the western Malayo-Polynesian witnesses and because
there is virtually no chance that the agreement is due to borrowing or chance similarity,
this distribution is enough to justify the reconstruction of PMP _*apij_, POc _*apic_ ‘twins’.

    The rake-like form of Figure 1.2 almost certainly reflects the very rapid settlement of
Oceania out of the Bismarcks,[14] but it confronts us with a methodological question. If we
follow the rubric that we make a reconstruction if a cognate set occurs in languages of just
two primary subgroups, then reflexes of an etymon in, say, a SE Solomonic language and a
Micronesian language would be sufficient evidence for a POc reconstruction and the absence
of reflexes in Admiralty and Western Oceanic would be irrelevant. Given what we know
about the location of the POc homeland (in the Bismarcks; vol.2, ch.2) and the early eastward
spread of Oceanic speakers, this is too loose a criterion. Instead, we assume two hypothetical
nodes not shown in the tree in Figure 1.2.[15] These are

__ul__
- Remote Oceanic, comprising Southern Oceanic, Micronesian and Central Pacific;
- Eastern Oceanic, comprising SE Solomonic and Remote Oceanic.[16]


[13] Because they have only been recently proposed, Temotu and Southern Oceanic do not appear in Figure 1 of
volumes 1 and 2.

[14] Bearers of the Lapita culture had settled various parts of the Bismarck Archipelago by around 1400 BC
 (Specht 2007) and colonised the Reefs and Santa Cruz Is. in the Temotu Archipelago by 1200-1100 BC
(Green 2003, Green et al. 2008). There were Lapita settlements in New Caledonia by 1100-1000 BC (Sand 2001), in
Fiji by about 1000 BC (Clark & Anderson 2009, Nunn et al. 2004), in Tonga by 900 BC (Burley & Connaughton 2007),
and in Samoa and the smaller islands between Tonga and Samoa by 800-700 BC (Clark & Anderson 2009).

[15] We included these nodes in the corresponding tree in Figure 1 of volumes 1 and 2, but this was too easily
interpreted as a statement of our views on subgrouping, so we abandon it here and in Appendix 2.

[16] The term ‘Eastern Oceanic’ and the search for evidence of an Eastern Oceanic subgroup has a relatively
long pedigree in Oceanic linguistics (Biggs 1965, Pawley 1972, Pawley 1977, Lynch & Tryon 1985, Geraghty
 1990). However, by the time volume 1 of the present work was published in 1998 it was already evident that
innovations supporting the existence of an Eastern Oceanic subgroup were not forthcoming, as
Pawley & Ross (1995:79) had mentioned in a footnote. Our use of the term here is more inclusive than most, resembling more
closely the ‘Central/Eastern Oceanic’ of Lynch & Tryon (1983) (the published version of which, Lynch & Tryon 1985,
presents a less inclusive version of Central/Eastern Oceanic) and of Lynch et al. (2002:94-96). who also
express reservations about its status.

                                                                                         Introduction       13


If a cognate set occurs in two or all three of the groups in Remote Oceanic, the reconstruction
is attributed to Proto Remote Oceanic (Proto Remote Oceanic). If a cognate set occurs in one or more of the
groups in Remote Oceanic and in SE Solomonic, it is attributed to Proto Eastern Oceanic
(PEOc). In this way we acknowledge that such reconstructions may represent an innovation
that postdates the spread of the early Oceanic speech community. There are enough Proto Remote Oceanic and
PEOc reconstructions to suggest that such lexical innovations indeed occurred. This in turn
provides weak evidence for Remote Oceanic and Eastern Oceanic subgroups, but evidence
that is too weak to be relied on, for at least two reasons. First, it is quite possible that some of
our Proto Remote Oceanic and PEOc reconstructions will be promoted to POc as more Admiralty and Western
Oceanic data become available. Second, it is reasonable to assume that some of our Proto Remote Oceanic
and PEOc etyma are of POc antiquity but happen to have been lost in Proto Admiralty and
Proto Western Oceanic. Without supporting phonological or morphological evidence we are
unwilling to treat Proto Remote Oceanic or PEOc as anything other than convenient hypotheses which allow
us to retain rigorous criteria for a POc reconstruction.

     In volumes 1 and 2 a reconstruction here labelled ‘Proto Remote Oceanic’ would have been labelled
‘PEOc’, but the absence of SE Solomonic reflexes from among its reflexes indicates that
it has the same status as a Proto Remote Oceanic reconstruction in volume 3 and the present volume. Two
factors have led to the distinction between PEOc and Proto Remote Oceanic here. One was particularly relevant to
volume 3: because the primary biogeographic divide in Oceania is between Near
and Remote Oceania (see vol. 2, Map 5), i.e. between the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, the
question of whether or not a plant name includes a SE Solomonic reflex is significant, and
there are many plant names that do not (and are thus attributed to Proto Remote Oceanic). The other is that the
historical separateness of SE Solomonic from both Western Oceanic and the groups treated
as Remote Oceanic has become increasingly clear through recent research (Pawley 2009).

     Our criterion for recognising a reconstruction as POc is that the cognate set must occur
in at least two out of four criterial groupings: Admiralties (or Yapese or Mussau), Western
Oceanic, Temotu and our hypothetical Eastern Oceanic. Both here and at the hypothetical
interstages defined above, no reconstruction is made if there are grounds to infer borrowing
from one of these groupings to another.[17] We also reconstruct an etymon to POc if it is
reflected in just one of the four criterial groupings and in a non-Oceanic Austronesian language
(a member of one of the subgroups on the left branches in Figure 1.1), as illustrated above
by the reconstruction of POc _*apic_ ‘twins’.


[17] Cases where such an inference can be made occur mostly at the boundary (in the Solomon Islands) between
Western and Eastern Oceanic. Borrowing is likely (and is often reflected in unexpected sound correspondences)
where an etymon occurs (i) in Western Oceanic and only in SE Solomonic languages or (ii) in SE Solomonic
languages and only in the NW Solomonic languages (a subgroup within the Meso-Melanesian linkage of Western Oceanic).

14   Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


     These criteria are identical to those applied in volumes 1 and 2 except for the addition of
Temotu (which figures in very few cognate sets). The establishment of Temotu as a primary
subgroup (Ross & Nasss 2007) postdates the publication of volumes 1 and 2.

     There are indications that Yapese (a single-language subgroup) and Mussau and Tench (a
subgroup with two closely related languages) may be more closely related to Admiralty than
to any other Oceanic subgroup,[18] and for this reason they are treated as Admiralty languages
for the purposes of reconstruction. That is, the presence of a reflex in one or more of these
languages and in Admiralty does not support a POc reconstruction, but the presence of of a
reflex in one or more of these languages and one of Western Oceanic, Temotu and Eastern
Oceanic does support one.

     In chapter 2 (§4) of volume 2 Pawley discusses Blust’s (1998a) proposal that the primary
split in Oceanic divides Admiralty from a subgroup embracing all other Oceanic languages.
Pawley dubs the latter ‘Nuclear Oceanic’. If Blust’s subgrouping were accepted, then an
etymon which lacked cognates outside Oceanic would need to be reflected both in an Admiralties
language and in a non-Admiralties language for a POc reconstruction to be made.
Etyma with reflexes in both Western and Eastern Oceanic, but not in the Admiralties, would
be reconstructed as Proto Nuclear Oceanic. Under the criteria outlined above, however, we
attribute these reconstructions to POc. These criteria were used in volumes 1 and 2, and
we have thought it wise to maintain them throughout the volumes of this work. The reader
who wishes to single out reconstructions attributable to a putative Proto Nuclear Oceanic
(rather than to POc) can easily recognise them, however. They are those POc reconstructions
for which (i) there are no Admiralties reflexes, and (ii) there is no higher-order
reconstruction (i.e. PEMP, PCEMP, PMP or PAn), since the latter would be based on cognates outside
Oceanic.


1.3.3 Sound correspondences

As we noted above, reconstruction depends on working out the systematic sound correspondences
among cognate vocabulary in contemporary languages and on having a working hypothesis about
how the sounds of POc have changed and are reflected in modern Oceanic
languages. Working out sound correspondences even for twenty languages is a large task,
and so we have relied heavily on our own previous work and the work of others. The sound
correspondences we have used are those given by Ross (1988) for Western Oceanic and Admiralties;
by Levy (1979, 1980) and Lichtenberk (1988) for Cristobal-Malaitan, by Pawley
(1972) and Tryon & Hackman (1983) for SE Solomonic; by Ross & Nasss (2007) for Temotu;
by Tryon (1976) and Clark (2009) for North and Central Vanuatu; by Lynch (1978, 2001)
for Southern Vanuatu; by Geraghty (1989), Haudricourt & Ozanne-Rivierre (1982), Ozanne-Rivierre (1992)
and Ozanne-Rivierre (1995) for New Caledonia; by Jackson (1986) and Ross (1996a) for Nuclear
Micronesian; by Geraghty (1986) for Central Pacific; by Biggs (1978)
for Polynesian; by Ross (1996a) for Yapese; and by Ross (1996b) for Oceanic languages of
Irian Jaya.

    For non-Oceanic languages we have referred to sound correspondences given by Tsuchida (1976)
for Formosan languages; by Zorc (1977, 1986) and Reid (1982) for the Philippines;
by Adelaar (1992b) and Nothofer (1975) for Malay and Javanese; by Sneddon (1984) for
Sulawesi; by Collins (1983) for Central Maluku; and by Blust (1978a) for South Halmahera
and Irian Jaya.

    We are well aware that regular sound correspondences can be interfered with in various
ways: by phonetic conditioning that the analyst has not identified (see, e.g., Blust 1996a), by
borrowing (for an extreme Oceanic case, see Grace 1996), or, as recent research suggests, by
the frequency of an item’s use (Bybee 1994). We have tried at least to note, and sometimes
to account for, irregularities in cognate sets.


1.3.4 POc phonology and orthography

Work based on the sound correspondences of both Oceanic and non-Oceanic languages has
resulted in the reconstructed paradigm of POc phonemes shown in Table 1.1. The orthography
used here and in the POc reconstructions in this work is from Ross (1988), with the
addition of _*pʷ_ and _*kʷ_. POc phonology and its relationship to PMP are discussed in greater
detail in Chapter 2 (§2) of volume 1. Since the publication of volume 1, articles by John
Lynch have appeared on POc stress (2000) and POc labiovelar phonemes (2002). The putative
protophoneme _*kʷ_ is added in this volume for the first time as a result of taking stock
of reconstructions in volumes 1-3 and the current volume. It must have had a very low
functional load, as it occurs only word-initially before _*a_ and then only rarely (Ross 2010).

                                                                                        Introduction   17

    Table 1.2 shows two POc orthographies. The first was established by Biggs (1965), for
PEOc, and Grace (1969), who applied it to POc. It has been used with a number of variants,
separated by a slash in Table 1.2. The second, introduced by Ross (1988), is the one generally
used in this work. The terms ‘oral grade’ and ‘nasal grade’ were used by Grace (1969) and
have become conventional among Oceanic linguists to refer to the outcomes of certain sound
changes that occurred between PMP and POc (vol.1, ch.2, §2.4).


1.4 Conventions common to the series

1.4.1 Presentation of reconstructions

Each of the contributions to these volumes concerns a particular POc ‘terminology’.
Generally, each contribution begins with an introduction to the issues raised by the reconstruction of
its particular terminology, and the bulk of each contribution consists of reconstructed etyma
with supporting data and a commentary on matters of meaning and form.

     The reconstruction of POc _*taRaqan_ ‘Holocentrus spp., squirrelfish’ below, adapted from
Chapter 2, §14, shows how reconstructions and supporting cognate sets are presented. Above
it is a superordinate (PMP) reconstruction drawn from Blust’s Austronesian Comparative
Dictionary (ACD; see §2). Below it are supporting reflexes. Contributors vary in the degree to
which they insert lower-order reconstructions like PMic _*tard_ and PPn _*taʔa_ below. Lower-order
reconstructions are sometimes given to clarify the relationship of reflexes to the higher-order
reconstruction: Southern Vanuatu languages, for example, have undergone so much
phonological change that a Proto Southern Vanuatu reconstruction helps explicate the relationship
between Southern Vanuatu reflexes and the POc reconstruction. Sometimes a lower-order
reconstruction displays an extension of meaning or some other semantic change.

    Because our supporting data are drawn from such a wide range of languages, the convention
is adopted of prefixing each language name with the abbreviation for the genealogical
or geographic group to which the language belongs, so that the distribution of a cognate set
is more immediately obvious. Table 1.3 is a key to the labels. Figure 1.2 shows the positions
of these groups in the Oceanic tree. We have sought to be consistent in always listing these
groups in the same order, but contributors vary in the ordering of languages within groups.

    Lynch’s recent research on Southern Oceanic (§3.2.3) renders the NCV group mildly
anomalous, although there is no doubt that it reflects an integrated dialect network. There
are a number of etyma whose reflexes are confined to North and Central Vanuatu, and so we
continue to make ‘Proto North/Central Vanuatu’ reconstructions, even though these perhaps
represent a Southern Oceanic term that has been lost in southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia.
Where the distribution of reflexes requires it, the chapters in this volume include
reconstructions for Proto Remote Oceanic and for PSOc. Etyma with these distributions were attributed to PEOc in
volumes 1 and 2, but the distributions are transparent, thanks to the presence of the group
labels in cognate sets.


                                                                                 Introduction      19


    In the interests of space we have not given the history of the reconstructions themselves,
as this would often require commentary on the modifications made by others and by us, and
on why we have made them. Where a reconstruction is not new, we have tried to give its
earliest source, e.g. ‘ACD’ above, but this is difficult when earlier reconstructions differ in
form and meaning.

    In general, the contributions to these volumes are concerned with items reconstructable
in POc, PWOc, PEOc, Proto Remote Oceanic and occasionally Proto New Guinea Oceanic (PNGOc). Etyma
for PWOc, PNGOc and PEOc are reconstructed because these may well also be POc etyma
for which known reflexes are not well distributed (see discussion in §3.2.4). The contributors
vary in the degree to which they reconstruct etyma for interstages further down the tree.
Reconstructions for lower-order interstages are decreasingly likely to reflect POc etyma and
may be the results of cultural change as Oceanic speakers moved further out into the Pacific.

    Contributors have usually not sought to make fresh reconstructions at interstages
superordinate to POc. What they have done, however, is to cite other scholars’ reconstructions for
higher-order interstages, as these represent a summary of the non-Oceanic evidence in support
of a given POc reconstruction. These interstages are shown in Figure 1.1, together with
their abbreviations.

    Sometimes non-Oceanic evidence has been found to support a POc reconstruction where
no reconstruction at a higher-level interstage has previously been made. In this case a new
higher-order reconstruction is made, and the non-Oceanic evidence is given in a footnote.

    Whilst we have tried to use the internal organisation of the lexicons of Oceanic languages
themselves as a guide in setting the boundaries of each terminology, we have inevitably taken
decisions which differ from those that others might have made. There are, obviously, overlaps
and connections between various semantic domains and therefore between the contributions
here. We have done our best to provide cross-references, but we have sometimes duplicated
information rather than ask the reader repeatedly to look elsewhere in the book. Indexes at the
end of each volume and in the final volume are intended to make it easier to use the volumes
collectively as a work of reference.

1.4.2 Data

Data sources are listed in Appendix 1.

     For some reconstructed etyma only a representative sample of reflexes is given. We have
endeavoured to ensure, however, that in each case this sample not only is geographically and
genetically representative, but also provides evidence to justify the shape of the reconstruction.
Where only a few reflexes are known to us, this is usually noted.

     Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages from
which data are cited here, all data are transcribed as far as possible into a standard phonemic
orthography based on that used by Ross (1988: 3--4) in order to facilitate comparison.[19] This
means, for example, that the _j_ of the German-based orthographies of Yabem and Gedaged
becomes _ʃ_, Yabem _c_ becomes _ʔ_, Gedaged _z_ becomes _ɬ_ and so on; the _ng_ of English-based
orthographies becomes _ŋ_, and Fijian _g_, _q_ and _c_ become _ŋ_, _g_ and _ð_ respectively.

     The following symbols have more or less their usual IPA values:
_ð_, _g_,
_ɢ_, _ɣ_, _h_, _k_, _l_, _ɬ_, _ʎ_, _m_, _n_, _ŋ_, _ñ_, _p_, _q_, _χ_, _ɾ_, _r_, _s_, _t_, _w_, _x_,
_z_, _ʔ_, _a_, _ᴂ_, _e_, _ɛ_, _ə_, _i_, _ɨ_, _o_, _œ_, _ɔ_, _ʌ_, _u_, _ɯ_.
As far as possible, however, our
orthography is phonemic and does not show allophonic variation, so that there are instances
where a symbol does not have its usual phonetic value. For example, Wayan Fijian _k_ is a
voiceless stop word-initially but [k] is in free or stylistic variation with [y] word-medially.
The voiced stops
_b_, _d_, _g_ and the voiced bilabial trill _ʙ_ are prenasalised in some languages, but prenasalisation
is not written unless it is phonemically distinctive. Where a language has
just one rhotic, we usually write r, despite the fact that that rhotic is sometimes a flap.
Other orthographic symbols (with values in IPA) are:

__tablenh__
           _f_  |  [ɸ, f]     |  voiceless bilabial or (less often) labio-dental fricative
           _v_  |  [β, v]     |  voiced bilabial or (less often) labio-dental fricative
           _c_  |  [ts], [tʃ] |  voiceless alveolar or palatal affricate
           _j_  |  [dz], [dʒ] |  voiced alveolar or palatal affricate
           _y_  |  [j]        |  palatal glide
           _dr_ |  [ⁿr]       |  prenasalised voiced alveolar trill (as in Fijian)
           _ö_  |  [ø]        |  rounded mid front vowel
           _ü_  |  [y]        |  rounded high front vowel

 Other superscripts and diacritics are as follows:

__block__
- contrastive long vowels are represented by a macron, e.g. _ā_;
- contrastive vowel nasalisation in New Caledonian languages is represented by a circumflex, e.g. _â_;
- labialisation is marked by a superscript _w_, e.g. _pʷ_;
- velarisation is marked by a superscript _ɯ_, e.g. _pᵚ_;
- contrastive aspiration is marked by a superscript _h_, e.g. _pʰ_;
- apicolabials are represented by the corresponding apical symbol and the linguolabial diacritic (the 'seagull' ), e.g. _tᫀ_;
- retroflexes are represented by the corresponding apical symbol with a dot beneath, e.g. _ṛ_.

[19] The main reason for retaining Ross' orthography was that the electronic files initially used in this project
were drawn in large part from those used in the research reported in Ross (1988).

                                                                            Introduction    21


     Except for inflexional morphemes, non-cognate portions of reflexes, i.e. derivational
morphemes and non-cognate parts of compounds, are shown in parentheses (...). Where an inflexional
morpheme is an affix or clitic and can readily be omitted, its omission is indicated
by a hyphen at the beginning or end of the base. This applies particularly to possessor
suffixes on directly possessed nouns (vol. 1, ch.2, §3.2). Where an inflexional morpheme cannot
readily be omitted, then it is separated from its base by a hyphen. This may happen because
of complicated morphophonemics or because the morpheme is always present, like the adjectival
_-n_ in some NNG and Admiralties languages and prefixed reflexes of the POc article
 _*na_ in scattered languages. When a reflex is itself polymorphemic (i.e. the morphemes reflect
morphemes present in the reconstructed etymon) or contains a reduplication, the morphemes
or reduplicates are also separated by a hyphen.

     Languages from which data are cited in this volume are listed in Appendix B in their
 subgroups, together with an index allowing the reader to find the subgroup to which a given
language belongs. Appendix B also includes alternative language names. The difficulty of
deciding where the borderline between dialect and language lies, combined with the fact that
these volumes contain work by a number of contributors, has resulted in some inconsistency
in the naming of dialects in the cognate sets. Some occur in the form ‘Kara (E)’, i.e. the East
dialect of the Kara language, or ‘Lukep (Pono)’, i.e. the Pono dialect of the Lukep language,
whilst others are represented simply by the dialect name, e.g. Iduna, noted in Appendix B as
 ‘Iduna (= dialect of Bwaidoga)’.


1.4.3 Conventions used in representing reconstructions

Reconstructions are marked with an asterisk, e.g. _*taRaqan_ ‘squirrelfish’, in keeping with
the standard convention in historical linguistics. POc reconstructions, and also PWOc and
PNGOc reconstructions, are given in the orthography of §3.4. For reconstructions at higher-order
interstages the orthographies are those used by Blust in his various publications and the
ACD. Reconstructions at lower-order interstages are given in the standard orthography adopted
for data (§4.2). Geraghty’s (1986) PCP orthography, for example, is based on Standard Fijian
spelling, and is converted into our standard orthography in the same way as Fijian spelling is.
In practice, this means that the orthographies for PEOc, Proto Remote Oceanic and PCP are the same as for
POc, except that a distinction between _*p_ and _*v_ is recognised and _*R_ is absent from PCP.
Biggs and Clark’s PPn reconstructions are in any case written in an orthography identical
to our standard. Bracketing and segmentation conventions in protoforms are shown in Table
 1.4.

      PMP final consonants are usually retained in POc in absolute word-final position. In many
cases decisive evidence for retention or loss can be found in those Oceanic languages that
usually retain final consonants. However, there are some cases where it is uncertain whether
POc kept the PMP finals. This is so when a PMP etymon is not attested in an Oceanic language that
consistently retains POc final consonants. An example is _*-R_ in PMP _*kamaliR_
‘men’s house’, a term reflected in Oceanic only in certain languages that regularly lose POc
final consonants. In such cases the consonant is reconstructed in parentheses (e.g. POc
_*kamali(R)_).

      In presenting words that display anomalies of form, it is often necessary to posit
an expected form. For example, in the cognate set supporting POc _*taRaqan_ ‘squirrelfish’ in §4.1,
the Loniu form _taʔay_ is presented in support of PEOc _*taRaqan_. Given the reconstruction,
however, we would expect the Loniu form to be _taya(ʔ)_. In this volume we use a less widely
employed convention and mark expected forms with a dagger, e.g. †_taya(ʔ)_, to distinguish
them both from reconstructions and real data.[20]

[20] Another convention sometimes used for this purpose is a double asterisk, e.g. _**taya(ʔ)_. we prefer the dagger
 on aesthetic grounds.

22 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pciwley and Meredith Osmond

: __Table 1.4__      Bracketing and segmentation conventions in protoforms

             (x)    |  it cannot be determined whether x was present
              (x,y) |  either x or y was present
              [x]   | the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with and one without x
              [x,y] | the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with x and one with y
              x-y   |  x and y are separate morphemes
              x-    |  x takes an enclitic or a suffix
              <x>   |  x is an infix

     Sometimes we need to refer to a reconstructed form that one would expect as the regular
reflex of an established POc etymon, but which does not occur because an irregular sound
change has occurred. In such cases the dagger and asterisk conventions are used together. For
example, in ch.7, §4, we reconstruct POc _*simuk_ ‘mosquito, small biting fly’. Its Proto SE
Solomonic reflex is reconstructed as _*simi_ (this is the form reflected by the SE Solomonic
data), but the expected (regular) Proto Southeast Solomonic form, referred to in our discussion, is
†_*simu_, the regular reflex of POc _*simuk_. The dagger marks it as expected but not attested
to.

     Sometimes a hypothetical POc form is marked in this way. In ch.7, §5, we cite PMP
_*nik-nik_, _*ñik-ñik_ ‘tiny biting insect: gnat, sandfly, fruitfly’. The expected POc form is †_*ninik_,
marked with a dagger because it does not actually occur. Instead, the Oceanic data require us
to reconstruct the irregular form POc _*niku-niku_ ‘small biting fly’.

     When historical linguists compile cognate sets they commonly retain word for word the
glosses given in the sources from which the items are taken. However, again in the interests
of standardisation, we have often reworded (and sometimes abbreviated) the glosses of our
sources, while preserving the meaning. Where glosses were in a language other than English
we have translated them. In the interests of space and legibility, and because data often have
multiple sources, we have given the source of a reflex only when it is not included in the
listings in Appendix A.

     Sometimes we use the convention of providing no gloss beside the items in a cognate set
whose gloss is identical to that of the POc (or other lower-order) reconstruction at the head
of the set, i.e. the reconstruction which they reflect.

     Where necessary, we use ‘(v)’, ‘(vi)’, or ‘(vt)’ to indicate that a gloss is a verb, intransitive
verb or transitive verb, ‘(n)’ to indicate that it is a noun.

     Within glosses we use the conventional abbreviations ‘k.o.’ (as in ‘k.o. yam’) for ‘kind
of’, ‘s.o.’ for ‘someone’, ‘s.t.’ for ‘something’, ‘sp.’ for a species and ‘spp.’ for more than
one species.

                                                                               Introduction    23

     In putting together cognate sets we have quite often found possible cognates which do not
quite ‘fit’ the set: they display unexplained phonological irregularities or their meaning is just
a little too different from the rest of the set for us to assume cognacy. Rather than eliminate
them we often include them below the cognate set under the rubric ‘cf. also’.


1.5 Indexes

This volume has three indexes. The first, as in volumes 1 and 2, is an index of reconstructions
arranged by their protolanguages. The second is an alphabetical list of reconstructions. The
third is an index of animals by their English and Linnaean glosses.



2 Fish

2.1 Introduction

Proto Oceanic speaking communities subsisted on what they could grow and gather and what
they could glean from the reef and sea.[1] Through their dependence on fishing, the inhabitants
would have amassed knowledge of the environments favoured by particular fish, and awareness of
fish habits as they related to such things as season of the year, the lunar and diurnal
cycle, tidal movements, winds and currents. The times of certain fish to be fat, to be abundant,
and to aggregate in a certain spot for spawning or feeding would have been marked.

     This chapter deals mainly with the names of fishes. Paul Geraghty (1994) and Robin
Hooper (1994) have provided a substantial starting point with their work on reconstructing
fish names for Proto Central Pacific and Proto Polynesian respectively. Their data and lower-level
reconstructions are reproduced here when included in a higher level reconstruction.
Otherwise I simply record the existence of a PCP or PPn reconstruction.

     In most Oceanic languages the lexicon of fish names is the largest of all faunal fields. The
lists of local fish names available to me include almost 300 items for Mbunai Titan in the
Admiralties (Akimichi & Sakiyama 1991), over 400 for both Marovo in the NW Solomons
(Hviding 1996), and Wayan Fijian (Pawley & Sayaba 2003), 250 for Kapingamarangi in Polynesia
(Lieber 1994) and around 400 for Satawalese in Micronesia (Akimichi & Sauchomal 1982). 
The evidence is overwhelming that knowledge of fish is, or has been until the breakdown
of traditional lifestyles, extremely detailed, and one not restricted to a small group of
people, but widespread among the majority of Oceanic communities.

[1] I am particularly grateful to Malcolm Ross who has spent many hours checking and suggesting solutions
 to problematic cognate sets, and to Paul Geraghty for a host of detailed comments. Andrew Pawley has also
 commented on earlier drafts and made many useful suggestions. Others who have contributed over the years
 that this work has been in progress include Simon Foale, Alexandre François, John Lynch. Alice Pomponio,
 the late Phil Quick, Kevin Salisbury, Ian Scales and David Walsh.

26   Meredith Osmond

     A preliminary question that arises is: Do varieties of fishes in the tropical Pacific diminish
in number the further one moves east from the major land masses? From linguistic evidence
alone it appears that the major families continue to be represented throughout the region, but
the number of genera and species diminishes. The greatest number of families noted in a
wordlist available to me is from one of the more remote locations.[2]

    Davis’s (1999) listing for Chuuk records 71 of the 78 families included in my survey.[3]
Leach & Davidson (2000) have considered the question from an archaeological perspective.
From fish remains identified from 24 different island groups in the tropical Pacific they list
 48 families that were taken in any quantity by prehistoric people (p.414). Although they
note signs of regional specialisation, they write that this ‘cannot be explained by changes
in natural abundance of fish types from one place to another’ but is due rather to aspects
of human behaviour (p.416). Thus it should be possible to reconstruct terms to at least the
taxonomic level of family from the full range of linguistic subgroups including Micronesia
and Polynesia, notwithstanding that the range of environment declines. This is in contrast to
the land-based flora and fauna.

    Although I have used western taxonomy as the basis of my classification, it should not
be assumed that all Oceanic peoples used a similar system of organization. As an example,
Edvard Hviding describes the system used by the people of the Marovo Lagoon, on the island
of New Georgia, western Solomons. He writes:

|       Marovo fish taxonomy has a structure that differs considerably from Linnaean or western
|       scientific taxonomy. For instance, a number of Marovo fish taxa are highly general
|       “lump” categories that cover a considerable number of Linnaean species under one name.
|       The _temi kepe_ (etymology uncertain) covers, without further specification, all
|       (in western terms) ‘butterflyfish’ and ‘coralfish’, as well as any number of similar small, colorful
|       reef fish with high and flat bodies. On the other hand, one Linnaean species may be
|       subdivided in Marovo into a great number of named subtypes. One example is the skipjack
|       tuna or makasi, which in Marovo has more than a dozen specific names that refer to
|       growth stages, colorings, and more. Important food species are often finely subdivided
|       in such a manner, in three-to-four-level taxonomic structures, while insignificant fishes,
|       such as the small reef species just mentioned, are more commonly “lumped”. This does
|       not imply that Marovo fishers do not generally and readily distinguish between similar
|       looking fish species. They have names for at least four hundred Marovo “species”, and
|       experienced people can easily single out and identify by name closely related fishes that
|       differ only very subtly in color or general appearance. For example, at least twelve types
|       of medium-sized parrotfish (no generic term in Marovo) are classified and named, as
|       well as more than seventeen ‘trevallies’ [Carangids: _mara_] and at least twenty ‘groupers’
|       [Serranids: _pajara_] (Hviding 1996:192-193).

[2] Apart from general dictionaries and wordlists, the following lists of fish names were consulted:
Andra, McEldowney (1995); Chuukese. Davis (1999); Dobu, Lithgow (1975); Gela, Foale (1998); Kadavu Fijian,

 comm.); Satawalese. Akimichi & Sauchomal (1982); Teop, Shoffner (1976); Uvean (Wallisian), Rensch (1983).

[3] Other totals recorded are 67 for Gela (SES), 66 for Wayan Fijian, 64 for Titan (Adm) and 62 for Satawalese
 (Mic).

                                                                                        Fish    27


    Primary lexemes can denote a fish at the species, the genus or the family level, and
occasionally, as with sharks and rays, suborders or even orders. Particular species are more likely
to be separately named if they are distinctive in appearance, like the bump-headed parrotfish,
or valued food, like the great barracuda. At the species level or lower, names are more likely
to be binomial. Some may be multimorphemic, reflecting attributes such as similarity of appearance,
habit (schooling or not), environment (e.g. bottom-dwellers, pelagic, fresh-water,
estuarine, reef or deep sea dwellers), whether diurnal or nocturnal, and nastiness (poisonous
to eat, stingers). Distinctive appearance may be reflected, with terms for head, nose, eye,
spikes, filaments, similarity to sail or palm leaf and so on being incorporated into the name.
In Polynesian languages some colour terms, particularly reflexes of PPn _*tea_ ‘white’, _*quli_
‘black’, _*kefu_ ‘reddish-brown’, _*kula_ ‘red’ and _*mea_ ‘reddish’, are quite common. Wayan
Fijian has _kati ni tanive_, lit. ‘biter of sardines’ for a medium sized trevally, after its feeding
habits, while a scorpionfish whose poisonous spines can inflict severe pain is called
_taŋitaŋi ga ua_, lit. ‘cry until high tide’. Niuean calls a species of parrotfish _mohe-aho_ lit. ‘sleep by
day’. Valued fish and fish whose appearance changes with age will often have names for
particular growth stages. In Tonga, for instance, a species of mullet (_Valamugil cunnesius_)
has six named stages, ranging from smallest to largest, _teʔevela_, _teʔekona_, _teʔefō_, _ʔunomoa_,
_kanahe_, and _kanahe fau_.

    A common difficulty in reconstructing the semantic range of a term is that although apparent
cognate names may exist in, say, the Admiralties, the Solomons and Polynesia, the
fishes bearing these names may belong to different species or genera. While some species
are widespread, others are highly restricted in their geographic range, and the name of a fish
in the Admiralties may well be given elsewhere to another species within the same family,
or to an unrelated fish that resembles it in some aspect. As well, the western scientific
taxonomy of fishes is subject to continuing revision and occasional name replacement. These
are problems both for the wordlist compiler in identifying a fish by its Linnaean classification
in addition to its common name, and for ourselves in tracing the somewhat fluid species
association that a cognate set may produce.


2.2 Organisation

The cognate sets that follow are grouped in terms of Linnaean families and high order groupings.
The ordering of groups substantially follows that of Ian Munro (1967) in his encyclopaedic volume
_The Fishes of New Guinea_. However, since then there have been numerous revisions to fish taxonomy.
In particular, I have been guided by the FishBase website
(Froese & Pauly 2010) in tracing synonyms and revised scientific classification. Dictionary
identifications have been retained, with any revision of terminology added in square brackets.

    For descriptions of fish appearance and behaviour I have also relied heavily on Munro (1967)
and Allen & Swainston (1993).

    Terms for fish parts are included in this chapter. Marine mammals have been included in
chapter 5.

2.3 Fish (generic)

It is likely that the POc term _*ikan_ had both a narrow and a broad sense. The narrow sense
applied to ‘typical’ fish, while the broad sense included some or all of the following: whales,
dolphins, dugongs, eels, turtles, cephalopods and rays. Shellfish are generally excluded in
daughter languages. See chapter 8 for a fuller discussion.

2.4 Sharks: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae etc

In this section and in §5 on rays, I am dealing with sub-orders rather than families.
Kailola (1987) lists twelve shark families, the best-known probably being Carcharhinidae, the largest,
with tiger sharks, black-tip and white-tip sharks among its species, and Sphyrnidae, hammerheads.

    Most sharks inhabit shallow coastal waters around reefs. A number of species are regarded
as dangerous, but in parts of the southeast Solomons sharks are thought to be the ghosts of
men and are considered sacred. I have reconstructed one possible generic term, _*bakewa_,
its cognates widespread, but undergoing a change of meaning in Central Pacific. Reflexes
of _*maŋewa_ have replaced _*bakewa_ as the generic term in Polynesia. In Motu and Fiji the
reflex of a POc term for shark has come to be applied instead to the remora or sucker fish
which attaches itself to sharks and other large sea creatures (§65). This is the case with Motu
_maɣoa_ and PCP _*bakewa_. Tolai _gul_ can be used to refer to either a ‘k.o. striped shark (tiger
shark?)’ or ‘the pilotfish _Naucrates ductor_’, a fish which also stays in the close vicinity of
sharks.

   Proto Oceanic speakers undoubtedly distinguished many different species of sharks by
name, as contemporary Oceanic speech communities do, but reconstructed terms have not
been clearly identified with particular species at a level higher than Proto Central Pacific.

   Cognates in the following set from the Admiralties, Papuan Tip, SE Solomons and Micronesia
provide the strongest evidence for _*bakewa_ as the generic term for ‘shark’ in POc.

    In Polynesian languages, reflexes of PPn _*pakewa_ usually refer to a trevally (belonging
to the same family as _Naucrates ductor_, the pilot fish), while reflexes of PPn _*maŋō_ are the
generic term for shark.

    The next reconstruction, POc _*maŋewa_ ‘shark’, appears to be a variant of _*bakewa_ in
which the stops are replaced by nasals. It is impossible to know how such a variant might
have arisen, but the probability of two formally parallel homonymous trisyllables arising by
chance is extremely low (Nichols 1996:50-51).

    The reconstruction _*maŋewa_ assumes that segment coalescence has occurred in both
Motu and the SES languages. Motu _maɣoa_ reflects coalescence of _*-ew-_ as _-o-_, SES _maŋeo_
coalescence of _*-wa_ as _-o_. Note that a similar change occurred in NCV and Micronesian
reflexes of _*bakewa_.

    Languages frequently use binomial terms to refer to particular shark species, although
sometimes the generic first element is regarded as optional. Fijian (unspecified) uses _gio_[4] +
modifier, e.g, _gio uvi_ ‘_Carcharhinus plumbeus_, sandbar shark’, _gio daniva_ ‘_Galeo cerdo_, tiger
shark’, _gio uluvai_ ‘hammerhead shark’ (Geraghty pers. comm.). Modifiers tend to develop
independently in different languages, although elements recur. Two of the Fijian modifiers,
_uvi_ and _daniva_, are found also in Polynesian terms, PPn _*nai-ufi_ ‘k.o. large shark, probably
tiger or grey reef shark’ and PPn _*tanifa_ ‘tiger shark’. The latter is remarkably a reflex of
POc _*tanipa_ ‘sardine’ (§7), presumably because of similar iridescent zigzag vertical lines on
both tiger sharks and sardines (Geraghty 1994: p. 143).

    Probably because of similar wavy iridescent lines on the sides of Spanish mackerel, also a
large predatory fish, reflexes of POc _*taŋiRi_ ‘Spanish mackerel’ (§57) have been incorporated
into names for a kind of shark in Muyuw (PT) and Marovo (MM).

__formgroup__
    PT: Muyuw     |tagili gal|    ‘shark’
    MM: Marovo    |kiso taŋiri|   ‘Galeocerdo cuvier, tiger shark, the most dangerous shark in Marovo’

    An obviously descriptive name, PCP _*mata qi taliŋa_ ‘eyes of ears’ is used in Central
Pacific languages to refer to the hammerhead shark, although the term has been lost in Eastern
Polynesian. In Molima (PT), this shark is referred to as _mala balabala_, literally ‘eyes
crosswise’, while in Gela (SES) it is _baɣea papala vohe_ ‘paddle-handle shark’.

[4] Geraghty (1994) has _*gio_.

2.5 Rays: stingrays (Dasyatidae), eagle rays (Myliobatidae), manta rays (Mobulidae)

Stingrays and eagle rays inhabit sandy bottoms in the vicinity of coral reefs, and are common in
estuaries where there is abundant mud. Eagle rays are so named because of their wide flaps and
ability to leap from the water. Manta rays rank among the largest known
fishes. They are specialised in having largely abandoned the bottom-living habit and usually swim near
the surface, often leaping from the water. Manta rays inhabit open ocean, and are seldom seen near
shore.

Figure 2.2: _Aetobatus narinari_, spotted eagle ray

     Reflexes of POc _*paRi_ are numerous and widespread. It seems
that the POc term had both a generic and a specific sense. Although most of the reflexes
listed below are glossed ‘stingray’, _*paRi_ is used as the first element in compound terms for
rays other than stingrays (see _*paRi-manuk_ below). The same pattern occurs in Marovo (NW
Solomonic) where _tape_ is the term both for stingrays and other rays in general, giving rise
to compounds like _tape kurukuru_ ‘spotted eagle ray, _Aetobatus narinari_`.

      Oceanic languages usually distinguish several taxa, typically binomials, _*paRi_ + modifier.

    Banks Islands languages (North Vanuatu) support Proto Banks _*vaRi mala_ ‘eagle ray’,
where the term for ‘hawk’ rather than ‘bird’ is the modifier (Alexandre François, pers. comm.).

    Reflexes of POc _*Ropok_ ‘to fly’ are sometimes used in compounds to distinguish rays
that leap from the water. Examples are Nakanai (MM) _kova lovo-lovo_ ‘ray with two wings’
(_kova_ ‘stingray’) and Gela (SES) _vali-lovo_ ‘eagle ray, manta ray, devil ray’.

    Lower level reconstructions include PCP *_vai bekʷa_, PPn _fai peka_ ‘_Aetobatus narinari_,
spotted eagle ray’ (PCP _*bekʷa_ ‘bat’) (Geraghty 1994: p. 144); PPn _fai kili_ ‘sandpaper ray’
(probably Himantura granulata, Dasyatidae) (_*kili_ ‘file’); and PNPn _fāfā-lua_ ‘_Manta birostris_.
manta ray’ (lit. ‘full of holes’, presumably a description of the pitted appearance of the skin),
the latter two from Hooper (1994: p. 197).


2.6 Bonefishes (Albulidae) and tarpons (Elopidae, formerly Megalopidae)

Bonefishes are coastal fishes, moderately sized and brilliantly silver, which often congregate
in large schools. They are generally valued as food, but have many fine bones. Tarpons are
also moderately large coastal game fishes which ascend rivers in search of food. The flesh
is tough, with numerous fine bones. They are renowned as active strong fighters capable of
swift movement, leaping ability and great endurance (Munro 1967: p.41).

     The two families are treated together because the second reconstruction below,
POc _*pu-pulan_, is based on cognates referring to both and seems a broader term than POc _*kuRo_,
bonefishes and tarpons are similar in colour and habitat, and both are marked by the presence
of many fine bones.

2.7 Sardines and herrings (Clupeidae) and anchovies (Engraulidae)

Figure 2.3: _Spratelloides delicatulus_, small round herring

Sardines and herrings are small migratory fishes which congregate in enormous shoals
in shallow coastal waters. Flesh is oily but tasty (Munro 1967: p.50). They are taken in nets
in Oceanic communities.

    Anchovies also live in large schools in coastal waters and estuaries. They have a
long slender maxillary (upper jaw) and protruding snout, and most are silvery or have a
bright silvery lateral band. Some species migrate seasonally, and the schools come close
inshore where they can be captured with seines (Munro 1967: p.43).

38    Meredith Osmond

    In the cognate sets which follow, terms show some crossover of meaning between sardines
and anchovies. This is most likely due to looseness of definition of the English terms by the
wordlist compilers, but it is possible that the two families are regarded as sufficiently similar
in some languages for one term to cover both. The fact that we can reconstruct six POc terms
indicates that speakers differentiated between the referents in some regard.

    In the next cognate set, there is reasonable consistency of meaning as far east as Fiji, but
Polynesian reflexes undergo a striking change of meaning, referring to a kind of shark with
similar markings to sardines (see p.33). Polynesian terms for sardine, together with a number
of Fijian terms, have the same form minus the first syllable.

2.8 Milkfishes (Chanidae)

This family consists of a single species, _Chanos chanos_. Fishes grow to around a metre in
length, are finely scaled, silvery and toothless. They inhabit both open sea and brackish water
and can ascend into rivers. They feed on crustaceans, worms and detritus. Although very
bony, the flesh has soft texture and excellent flavour (Munro 1967: p.54).

                                                                                    Fish     41

   There is a well-supported POc reconstruction continuing PMP _*qawa_ or _*qawan_. New
Caledonian reflexes provide support for final _*-q_. At least two SES cognates show confusion
with terms for mullet (cf. POc _*(k,q)aRua(s)_, §18).

2.9 Lizardfishes (Synodontidae)

Lizardfish are small, slender and cylindrical, with a rather wide mouth. Most are bottomliving
inhabitants of muddy or sandy areas of shallow coastal waters. They are barred and
mottled to blend in with bottom surroundings, and their general appearance suggests that of
a lizard. The flesh is not very bony but insipid (Munro 1967: p.70).

     The only reconstruction made for this family is PCP _*dolo_, PPn _*tolo_ ‘Sanrida, lizardfish’
(Geraghty 1994: p.146). These may reflect POc _*(t,d)oloq_ ‘eel’ (§11.3), with semantic shift.

Figure 2.4: _Plotosus lineatus_, striped eel catfish


2.10 Catfish (Plotosidae)

Catfish are recognizable by thick slimy naked skin and long head feelers which resemble a
cat’s whiskers. They are edible, with excellent flesh despite their appearance. Munro (1994: p.74)
describes most New Guinea species as estuarine, although some frequent fresh water, while
Geraghty (pers. comm.) notes that in Fiji and probably Polynesia catfish are found only in
salt water. They are carnivorous bottom feeders, swallowing anything in their way. _Plotosus anguillaris_ is a synonym for _Plotosus lineatus_.

    Reflexes undergo a change of meaning in some Polynesian languages. Hooper (1994: p.221)
suggests that an elongate shape may provide the semantic link with snake mackerels, and,
although the two are found in very different environments, both are black and slimy (Geraghty
pers. comm.).

2.11 Eels

Eels are classified in a number of families within the Order _Anguilliformes_. The best known
within the region are the freshwater eels (Anguillidae), and several sea eel families including
morays (Muraenidae), pike eels (Muraenesocidae), congers (Congridae) and snake eels
(Ophichthidae).


2.11.1 Freshwater eels (Anguillidae)

Although they spend most of their lives in fresh water, freshwater eels migrate to sea to spawn.
In inland areas they constitute an important food item. POc _*tuna_ is well supported as the
generic term for all freshwater eels.

2.11.2 Morays (Muraenidae)

Morays are large, thick-skinned eels with sharp knife-like teeth but no pectoral fins. They
can be pugnacious when confronted, although shy by nature. Many are nocturnal. They are
often found in the crevices of coral banks. There are numerous species in New Guinea waters,
many quite distinctive in colouring and markings.

    POc _*[la]bʷa(s,j)i_ ‘moray eel’ is reconstructable both with and without initial _*la-_.

2.11.3 Pike eels (Muraenesocidae) and congers (Congridae)

Pike eels are large, with prominent canine teeth and a long slender snout. Conger eels are
also large, with well-developed vertical and pectoral fins. The two are sometimes classified
together. The flesh of both is excellent. Both occur in shallow water, although congers also
have deep-water forms.

2.11.4 Snake eels (Ophichthidae)

Snake eels tend to lie on sandy or muddy bottoms in the vicinity of reefs, often spending daylight hours completely buried, although they can swim to the surface at night when attracted
by lights. They are difficult to trap, seldom taking a hook, while their slender bodies pass
through the mesh of nets and traps (Munro 1967: p.91). No reconstructions have been made.


2.11.5 Other terms for eels

In a number of reconstructions it has proved difficult to link terms to particular kinds of eel.
The following may be a generic term for sea eels.

>

    Mota has two similar terms, _maleo_ and _marea_, and it is possible that the former is a
borrowing from a Western Oceanic language. The next set is in complementary distribution
to the one above, and it may be that we are dealing with a single cognate set, although we
would expect Proto Remote Oceanic †_*malaya_ if directly inherited. It is possible that
Proto Remote Oceanic _*maraya_ was
borrowed from an unrecorded language’s reflex of POc _*malayo_. Arosi (SES) _marea_ ‘k.o.
eel’ also appears to reflect _*maraya_, but it is reasonably likely that this is a Mota borrowing
introduced by missionaries, as Mota was a missionary lingua franca which was also used in
parts of the Solomon Islands in the nineteenth century.

    The Polynesian terms may be linked through association with PPn _*tolo_ ‘to crawl’. Some
eels (particularly snake eels), lizardfish (§9) and mud skippers (§49) may all be described as
mud dwellers.

2.12 Flying fishes (Exocoetidae)

Figure 2.7: _Exocoetus volitans_, blue flying fish

These fish are pelagic, swimming near the surface and gliding above the water for considerable
distances. They inhabit open coastal and oceanic waters, are attracted to light at night
and often leap aboard vessels. Their flesh is of good quality (Munro 1967: p. 115). In Sa’a (Malaita),
flying fish, like the bonito, require a certain supernatural power to be caught. Certain
formalities must be followed and particular sacrifices made before a canoe can set out to catch flying
fish (Codrington 1891:138).

     Munro identifies more than a dozen species, but terms located have little elaboration of
identity.

    Lower-level reconstructions include PPn _*mālolo_ ‘flying fish spp.’ and PPn _*sasawe_
‘_Exocoetidae_ spp., flying fish’ (Hooper 1994 p.201).
PPn _*sipa_ ‘small or immature flying fish’ is considered to be a reflex of POc _*sipa_ ‘Hemiramphidae’, proposed in §13.


2.13 Half beaks and garfishes (Hemiramphidae), needlefishes and long toms (Belonidae)

Adult halfbeaks and garfishes have an elongated shaft-like lower jaw and very short upper
jaw, although in juveniles the mouth is symmetrical. Like needlefish they live near the surface
and are semipelagic. They inhabit shallow water and estuaries. The flesh is delicate but full of
fine bones. They are important food fishes (Munro 1967: p. 109). _Hemiramphus_ is the most common
genus.

    Needlefish and long toms are very slender, elongated with forceps-like jaws, well-toothed
with minute scales. They are both marine and estuarine, and a few live permanently in fresh
water. They often congregate in schools. Generally voracious, they are potentially dangerous
because of their great speed and habit of making sudden leaps, especially when attracted to
lights at night. The flesh is excellent (Munro 1967: p. 105). Genera include _Belone_, _Platybelone_,
_Strongylura_ and _Tylosurus_.

    The two families are here treated together because in a number of languages
(Halia, Kiribati, Mokilese, Rennellese, Samoan, Tikopia) there is one term covering both,
presumably reflecting similarities in shape and habitat.

>

    The change in gloss in PPn below can be explained because of close resemblance between
garfishes and some flying fish, with the latter, such as the beaked flying fish,
_Oxyporhamphus micropterus micropterus_, classified as Exocoetidae by Munro (p. 118) and more recently as
Hemiramphidae (Kailola 1987:153, FishBase). Half beaks, garfish and flying fish all belong
to the same suborder.

    Reduplicated reflexes of POc _*sao_ in PPn below, refer instead to _Sphyraena_, the barracuda,
and possibly its juvenile form. There is evidently some crossover of meaning between
PPn _*sao-sao_ ‘_Sphyraena_ sp.’ and PPn _*tao-tao_ ‘_Fistularia_ spp., probably including
trumpetfish’ (see §15). This may be because both barracuda and trumpetfish are, like the

2.14 Squirrelfishes, soldierfishes (Holocentridae)

This family is well-represented through the region by most of the approximately 70 species
known worldwide. Most are brilliant red, armoured with large rough scales with jagged edges.
The head is extremely rough and spiny. They have large eyes, and are often longitudinally
banded. Many species are nocturnal, living in holes in the reef during the day (Munro 1967: p. 138).
Although most of the species are small, the flesh is considered good eating. In Niuatoputapu
they are caught on moonlit nights either from a boat anchored near the reef or while standing
on the reef edge (Dye 1983:250). Genera include _Sargocentron_ [Holocentrus], _Myripristis_
and _Flammeo_. _Adioryx_ is now classified as a junior synonym of _Sargocentron_.

    A number of taxa are typically distinguished in Oceanic languages. Three POc terms are
reconstructable. Nuclear Micronesian reflexes in the following reconstruction confirm that
this form was trisyllabic, as an original disyllable would be reflected without final vowel
(ACD).

2.15 Trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae), cometfishes and flutemouths (Fistulariidae)

Trumpetfishes (Aulostomidae) have a long compressed body, long head and small mouth
at the end of a long compressed snout. Colours change from green through orange to reddish-brown
in harmony with surroundings. They are rather small, shallow-water fishes, frequently
observed resting motionless on the bottom (Munro 1967: p.149). The family is widely distributed
(Fowler 1928:6).

56   Meredith Osmond

    Cornetfishes somewhat resemble long toms, but are readily distinguished by long flutelike
snouts and whiplash-like filamentous prolongation of middle caudal (tail) fin rays (Munro 1967: p.149).

    A lower-level reconstruction is PCP _*baba_ ‘Fistularia, flutemouth’ (Geraghty 1994: p.148).
Hooper 1994 (p.200) offers PPn _*tao-tao_ ‘Fistularia sp., flutefish’, which no doubt reflects the
fish’s spearlike form (PPn _*tao_ ‘spear’).


2.16 Pipefishes, seahorses (Syngnathidae)

Most pipefishes (Syngnathidae) are long and thin, with a body covered in bony plates. Though
poor swimmers and very sluggish, many are widely distributed by currents. Jointed bony
armour of both species prevents active swimming. Fins are of little use and have degenerated
(Munro 1967: p. 151).

    The seahorse probably did not hold much interest for early Oceanic speakers, being
neither economically useful nor dangerous. Collected terms for it are rare, as evidenced
by responses to a request from Bruce Biggs on the an-lang e-mail list in 1999.[10] However, a
common element is apparent from NNG, MM and SES terms, reinforced by a term from
Yamdena (CMP), _bwa-watan_ ‘seahorse’ (_bwaye_ ‘crocodile’) which permits reliable reconstruction
of the word for crocodile as the first element in an otherwise variable compound.

Figure 2.12: Mugil cephalus, flathead grey mullet


    Kove (NNG) uses the same comparison, albeit with a non-cognate term for ‘crocodile’,
_baɣele ele ɑto_ ‘seahorse, pipefish’ (bayele ‘crocodile’, _ele_ 'its',_ato_ ‘messenger’) (Ann Chowning,
 pers. comm.[11]). In Dobu (PT) the term for crocodile is _warigoa_, and that for seahorse
or pipefish _wari-warigoa_, reduplication of the first two syllables being a common way of
indicating an inferior or diminutive form of the named item (Ross 2005b: 199).


2.17 Razorfishes (Centriscidae)

Razorfish are small, extraordinarily modified fishes which are extremely flattened and practically
transparent. They swim in small schools, each in a vertical position with head downward
among branching corals or sea urchins (Munro 1967: p. 148). The name in Gela for _Aeoliscus strigatus_,
razorfish is _iya tuyuru_, literally ‘standing fish’. They also ‘sleep’ under the sand and
will disappear under the sand when threatened by predators (Allen & Swainston 1993:82).
No reconstructions have been made.


2.18 Mullets (Mugilidae)

Some mullet species are extremely abundant, occurring in large schools in coastal waters and
estuaries. At least one species resides permanently in fresh water. The fish usually swim near
the surface and congregate among grass-like plants on tidal flats. They are readily taken in
hauling seines, although many possess great leaping powers and escape. The flesh is tasty
and rich, with few bones (Munro 1967: p. 164).

    Although there are two soundly based reconstructions going back to PMP level, and one
or two other more questionable POc reconstructions, I have very few cognates from Western
Oceanic. POc _*kanase_ is widely supported, and evidently refers to the best-known species,

_Valamugil cunnesius_, (formerly _Liza cephalus_ or _Mugil cephalus_]. POc _*kaRapa_ is reconstructable,
but as a term for _L. vaigiensis_ is reliable only for Eastern Oceanic. Reflexes of
POc _*(k,q)aRua(s)_ refer to a range of mullet species, with size/growth stage possibly relevant.

    Named growth stages of _Valamugil cunnesius_ are listed from Dobu (PT) and three Polynesian
languages. They run from from smallest to largest.

     Blust (2002:128) reconstructs both PMP _*qaRuas_ and PMP _*qawas_, but the reflexes of
the latter are almost all from languages in which _*R_ is lost, so it is reasonable to infer that
they reflect PMP _*qaRuas_, and that _*qawas_ is not reconstructable.

     Although the following set of forms points to POc _*kaRapa_, the reference is consistent
only for Remote Oceanic cognates. There is a single putative Western Oceanic reflex which
refers to the mandarin fish (_Synchiropus splendidus_), a distinctive, brilliantly coloured but
little-known fish, not more than 10 cm in length, and very dissimilar to mullets.

    Geraghty 1994 (p.157) reconstructs PCP _*jeqevo(o,u)_, PPn _*teqefō_ ‘juvenile mullet’. John
Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests that a number of New Caledonian reflexes, Fwai, Nemi, Jawe
_thiāp_ ‘mangrove mullet’, may be related, thus indicating Proto Remote Oceanic _*jeqevo(o,u)_.

    Hooper 1994 (p.204) reconstructs PPn _*fua-fua_ ‘juvenile mullet’. With the addition of Wayan
Fijian _vua-vua_ ‘small reef fish, 2-3 cm’ this reconstruction can be raised to PCP _*vua-vua_
‘k.o. small fish’.


2.19 Silversides, hardyheads (Atherinidae)

These are small silvery fishes occurring in large schools in shallow coastal waters and estuaries
where they can be netted. Munro (p. 171) lists a dozen or so species and describes them
as useful for bait. They are similar to sardines in appearance and behaviour.

2.20 Barracudas, sea-pikes (Sphyraenidae)

Barracudas are fast-swimming, carnivorous, pike-like fish, elongated and slender, which
slash their prey with sharp dog-like teeth. Larger ones are regarded as dangerous because
they have been known to attack humans. Munro calls them good fighters. They have firm
delicate flavoured flesh and are a valuable food fish. They are normally caught by trolling.
Larger species occur in coastal waters over shoals and around reefs (Munro 1967: p.161).

    Growth stages of _Sphyraena barracuda_[12] and _S. forsteri_ in Lau (SES) are _ono_, _mamal-ito_,
_ili_ (Akimichi 1978:308). Dye (1983:261) lists four growth stages for barracuda in the
Niuatoputapu dialect of Tongan: _tupuŋa-ʔono_, _momoto_, _hapatū_, _ʔono_.

    Five POc terms are reconstructable, with _*qonos_ possibly the generic. Final _*-s_ is indicated
by Nehan and the two Te Motu reflexes. Other reconstructions refer either to a particular
species or to particular growth stages.

    The cognate set below points to a four-syllable reconstruction _*bʷara-wa(r,d,dr,R)a(q)_
As the parentheses indicate, the reflexes do not agree as to the identity of the second liquid.
Admiralties and Papuan Tip languages reflect _*d_ or _*dr_, Southeast Solomonic languages
and Pije (New Caledonia) reflect _*r_, and Tikopia (Polynesian) reflects _*R_. However, it is so
unlikely that this set of forms is the result of chance that we must infer that borrowing has
taken place at some point. We also note that the Papuan Tip terms are glossed ‘moray eel’.


[13] The term _malisa_ ‘barracuda’ is quite widespread in Papua New Guinea, spread through Tok Pisin. which
 adopted it from Patpatar.

                                                                                   Fish    63


    John Lynch (pers. comm.) points out that a four-syllable reconstruction is likely to be
bimorphemic, i.e. _*bʷara-wa(r,d,dr,R)a(q)_, and cites New Caledonian evidence in support of
this. Nelemwa _bʷara-gom_ ‘moray eel’ seems to reflect the first morpheme, and Fwai _walagan_
‘barracuda’ perhaps contains the second.

    The next reconstruction, POc _*qutur_, shares the same form as a reconstruction for a very
dissimilar fish, the jobfish, the latter reconstructable to PMP level (see §30). A competing
gloss, ‘_Sphyraena_ sp., barracuda’, is based on cognates from PT, NCV and Pn. These two
etyma appear to be homonyms rather than cognates. Niuean retains a reflex of both etyma.
PPT _*qudur_, rather than †_*qutur_, is reconstructable for both jobfish and barracuda.

    Hooper (1994: p.203) identifies PPn _*sao-sao_ as a growth stage for juvenile barracuda (see

2.21 Sand basses, giant perches, barramundis (Centropomidae (Munro: Latidae))

These fish inhabit coastal waters, often penetrating into fresh water. They are noted for brilliant
glassy eyes which glow at night. Although we have an apparent POc reconstruction,
_*mata-pula_, lit ‘eyes’ + ‘shine’ (§24), the most consistent references of its reflexes are to
_Priacanthus cruentatus_ [now _Heteropriacanthus cruentatus_], ‘red globe-eye’ in Polynesian

may refer to Centropomidae.


2.22 Rock cods, reef cods, coral cods, groupers etc. (Serranidae)

These fish inhabit shallow coastal waters and estuaries, and are especially abundant around
coral reefs and shoals. Many are brilliantly coloured in shades of red to brown, some with
distinctive patterns. Nearly all are excellent eating. They are carnivorous and voracious, and one
species, _Epinephelus lanceolatus_, the Queensland grouper, which can grow to three metres in
length and up to 400 kg in weight, can be dangerous to divers (Munro 1967: p.264). Most, however,
are under a metre in length. Genera include _Epinephelus_, _Cephalopholis_ and _Plectropomus_,
each with dozens of species. Oceanic languages typically distinguish many taxa.

    Six POc reconstructions are supported. _*kuRapu_ seems reliably to refer to the most distinctive
member of the family, _Epinephelus lanceolatus_. Distinguishing the meanings of the other five
reconstructions has proved difficult. The lack of conformity in glosses may be due to the
possibility that the terms they represent are generic for particular groupings, with wordlists
naming only the most familiar members of the set.

    The gloss of ‘rock cod, grouper’ for the following reconstruction is based on reflexes
from Dobu (PT) and Fiji. In Gitua, Arosi, Woleaian and Hawaiian, apparent reflexes refer to
trevally, blenny, parrotfish or wrasse, while elsewhere in Polynesia they refer to the crescent
perch, _Terapon jarbua_ (§35). Such fish have little in common, and the similarity of name
may be coincidental.

[16] Ross (1994a: 418) discounted the Motu term as cognate on the basis that the initial consonants of Motu _dono_
 ‘brown spotted rock cod’, Lala _dono_ ‘k.o. fish’ and Roro _tono_ 'k.o. fish' all reflect POc _*s-_. However Motu _d-_,
unlike the other two. also reflects POc _*d_.

PCP _*ŋʷajala_ ‘_Epinephelus_ spp.’, PPn _*ŋatala_ ‘Epinephelus, smaller stage’,

(Geraghty 1004: p.149, Hooper 1994: pp.204-205)


2.23 Flagtails (Kuhliidae)

Munro 1967 (p.254) describes Kuhliidae as small to moderate-sized fishes, generally inhabiting
shallow coastal waters, with some species preferring brackish or fresh water, often in the
vicinity of mangroves. Salt-water species are a brilliant silver. Our only reconstructions are
lower-level: PCP _*sere_, PPn _*sesele_ ‘immature Kuhlia rupestris’, PCP _*drava_ ‘k.o. small
freshwater fish, possibly _Kuhlia_ sp.’ (Geraghty 1994: p.150) and PPn _*safole_ ‘_Kuhlia_ spp., flagtail’
(Hooper 1994: p.206).


2.24 Bigeyes, bullseyes (Priacanthidae)

These are small to moderate-sized fishes of distinctive appearance. All are bright rosy with a
rough sandpapery skin. The eye is large, about half head size. They are nocturnal, typically
spending daylight in caves or under ledges (Munro 1967: p.284).

68   Meredith Osmond

Figure 2.14: _Epinephelus lanceolatus_, Queensland grouper


   The PPn term, _*mata-pula_ ‘_Priacanthus cruentatus_, red globe-eye’ is a descriptive compound
(lit. _mata_ ‘eye’ + _pula_ ‘shine, glow’) (Hooper 1994: p.202). The same compound is found in
Kove (NNG), where the referent is a large freshwater fish, probably Centropomidae (§21).


2.25 Cardinalfishes (Apogonidae)

Cardinalfish are small carnivorous fishes. Many are vividly coloured, with striking patterns
of bands, stripes or spots. Most live in or around coral reefs and amongst weeds, and in
shallow tidal pools, although some prefer brackish water and others inhabit deeper water.
Like the Priacanthidae, they are nocturnal, hiding under ledges or in crevices during daylight.
The male usually carries the eggs and newly hatched young in its mouth (Munro 1967: p.241). No
reconstructions have been made.


2.26 Jacks, trevallies, scads, horse mackerels, kingfishes, darts, rainbow runners and leatherskins (Carangidae)

This is a large, widely distributed family of fast-swimming surface predators which generally
inhabit the coastal edge of the deep water. Larger species frequent edges of reefs. Most
congregate in schools, and can be caught along beaches with seines. Their flesh is of good
texture and flavour (Munro 1967: p.221). Oceanic languages typically distinguish many taxa.

    In Niuatoputapu, deep sea anglers take pride in withstanding the rigours of a dusk to
dawn session of _lauʔotule_, fishing from an anchored boat in around 17 fathoms of water, and
using a pressure gas lamp to attract the fish (big-eyed scad, _Selar crumenophthalmus_) (Dye 1983:250).

    I have six POc reconstructions, but can be confident of matching terms with specific genera for only four,
POc _*qatule_ ‘Selar spp., scad’, POc _*pilu_ ‘Caranx spp., trevally’, POc _*lasi_
‘_Scomberoides_ spp., leatherskin’ and POc _*kamaRi_ ‘_Elagatis bipinnulata_, rainbow runner’.
Other genera include _Carangoides_, _Trachinotus_, _Gnathanodon_, and _Decapterus_. Where the
reflexes cover a range of genera, the reconstructions are simply labelled carangid. The popularity
of these fish both as sporting fish and as food, and their role in places as appropriate
tribute for chiefs, are reflected by the number of terms for their growth stages. Here I can
reconstruct PPn terms for growth stages, _*lupo-lupo_ for the smallest and _*qulua_ for a large
caranx, (not necessarily the largest).

    Oceanic reflexes of the next set refer fairly consistently to _Scomberoides_ spp. (=Chorinemus),
fishes known variously as leatherskin, whitefish, queenfish, skinnyfish or giant dart.
They can grow to over a metre in length. Blust (ACD) has reconstructed PMP _*lajih_ ‘dolphinfish’
and PMP _*daRi_ ‘leatherskin’, with Oceanic reflexes of the former apparently referring
to the leatherskin. The two Mutu (NNG) terms below suggest that the dolphinfish may sometimes be
referred to as the leatherskin’s mother. For dolphinfish sets, see §27 below.

    Malcolm Ross (vol.2, pp.49-50) reconstructs POc _*mala_ ‘resembling’ which occurs in
plant names and occasionally, it seems, in fish names as well. Of the terms listed in the set
below, those consisting of a compound _mala_ + modifier could all be considered ‘resembling’
examples. If this is the common meaning of _*mala_ we would expect it to be reflected in terms
for fishes not necessarily related.[18] The fact that the most frequent reference in this set is to
carangids suggests that a similar form was a POc fish name. However, because the carangid
examples are largely restricted to the Solomons (the only exception being Samoan), it may
be that _*mala_ came to be used in the Solomons as a generic for carangids, as Hviding has
suggested for Marovo. For this reason no POc reconstruction is proposed.

2.27 Dolphinfishes (Coryphaenidae)

Figure 2.16: _Coryphaena hippurus_, common dolphinfish

Dolphinfish are large swift-swimming powerful fish, pelagic and mostly oceanic,
but sometimes found around reefs. They are spectacular fighters which leap from
the water when hooked. They have brilliant colouration and excellent flesh. Munro
(pp.218-219) records two species for the family, with _Coryphaena hippurus_ being
larger and better known than _C. equiselis_. They are not to be confused with dolphins,
cetaceans of the family Delphinidae, although some Polynesian dictionaries gloss their term
for _Coryphaena hippurus_ as ‘dolphin’.

2.28 Ponyfishes, slimys (Leiognathidae)

Ponyfishes are all very small, with a highly protractile mouth, the feature which is reflected in
an alternative name, pouters. Slime is exuded in large quantities after capture. Large schools
can be caught along sheltered beaches and estuaries (Munro 1967, p.237). In Lau (Malaita) they
are freshwater fish, moving between the rivers and the lagoon (Akimichi 1978:310). Few
terms have been located and no reconstructions made.


2.29 Fusiliers (Caesionidae)

Most fusiliers are brilliantly coloured with iridescent blue and yellow. They can be taken
in great abundance near coral reefs and rocky shores. Very large schools migrate for long
distances. They swim with synchronised quick precision. Flesh is coarse but not unpalatable
(Munro 1967: p.300). Hooper quotes Lewis et al. as describing them as important tuna baitfish in
many areas (Hooper p.192). This may explain why the Tokelauan term for mackerel scad, a
different fish but also a tuna baitfish, is cognate with terms for fusilier species in the following
set.

2.30 Snappers or sea-perch, basses, jobfishes (Lutjanidae)

Snappers are rather large fish with a sheathed maxillary, typically red or yellow in colouring.
Although known largely as reef fishes inhabiting rocky bottoms, the family includes deep sea
snappers. Their flesh is highly esteemed, although a few have been implicated in ciguatera
poisoning (Munro 1967: p.288).

    There are many species of Lutjanidae, some quite distinctive in markings, and Oceanic
languages typically distinguish several taxa. I have seven possible POc reconstructions but,
except for POc _*qutur_ ‘_Aprion virescens_, green jobfish’, it is difficult to give precise glosses.
Some are probably names of particular species, one or two are generic for two or more species,
others may be names of particular species at a certain stage of growth.

                                                                                              Fish     75

Figure 2.17: _Lutjanus fulviflamma_, Dory snapper


   The proposed gloss of POc _*qutur_ is based on the agreement of non-Oceanic cognates
with those of the Central Pacific.[19] _Aprion virescens_, the green jobfish, is found at depths that
vary from 0-180 metres (FishBase). See §20 regarding the homophony of this etymon with
POc _*qutur_ ‘k.o. fish, possibly Sphyraena sp., barracuda’ .

    PPn _*palu_ is included here with supporting evidence as an unusual case.
Hooper and Huntsman (1991:119-127) write that in Polynesia the two fishes which are associated most
strongly with the name _palu_ are unrelated: the oilfish _Ruvettus pretiosus_ and the deep sea
snappers (ruby snapper _Etelis carbunculus_, flower snapper _Pristipomoides zonatus_, big-eyed
snapper _Pristipomoides argyrogrammicus_, and the small-toothed jobfish _Aphareus furca_).
These fishes share deep water habitats, being caught at depths of 200 metres or more by
handline fishing, with the long line carrying a series of spaced hooks. The technique requires
great strength and skill, and Hooper quotes Roger Green as believing that it was probably
a late Samoic-Outlier innovation, depending as it does on suitable deepwater environments
where the fish can be found, calm water, adequate tackle and appropriate ocean-going canoe
skills. We have no evidence that POc speakers fished at this depth. See §56 for Gempylidae,
snake mackerels, oilfish.

reflected in its name as a reduplicated term for ‘beard’. They also have a projecting snout and
large adipose eyelids, which reflect adaptation to muddy environments where sense of touch
compensates for loss of vision. The flesh has excellent flavour and texture (Munro 1967: p. 189).

    Our only reconstruction is at PPn level, PPn _*kumi-kumia_ ‘_Polydactylus sexfilis_.
_P. plebeius_: threadfin’ (from POc _*kumi_ ‘beard’ (Hooper p.204). Hooper notes that the Tokelauan
word for _P. sexfilis_ is _ava-ava_. also meaning ‘beard’.

Misima (PT) has a term _kum-kum_ ‘generic for damselfish, _Chromis_ spp. and others’, considered
a chance resemblance.


2.33 Mojarras, silver biddies (Gerreidae)

The mojarras are small silvery fish with very protractile jaws, superficially resembling pouters
(Leiognathidae). They move in large schools, mostly along sandy shores (Munro 1967: p.331).

2.34 Sweetlips, javelinfishes (Haemulidae, formerly Plectorhynchidae and Pomadasyidae)

These moderate-sized fish inhabit coastal waters around coral reefs. Some, particularly the
juveniles, are strikingly marked and brightly coloured, but colour pattern varies greatly with
age. The flesh flavour is good (Munro 1967: p.315).

    Some of the following forms attributed to POc _*(k,q)umutuR_ show loss of the first syllable.
The only languages which disambiguate _*k-_ from _*q-_ are Nakanai, where _*k_ is reflected
and Wayan, where _*q_ is reflected. The Gela term is apparently borrowed from a Northwest
 Solomonic language as it retains final consonant with echo vowel.

2.35 Grunters, terapon perches (Teraponidae)

Teraponidae are small Indo-Pacific fish occurring in shallow tidal, brackish or fresh water.
Species differ greatly in proportions and colour, some plain and others conspicuously banded.
Some species make grunting noises (Munro 1967: p.320).

    There is a PPn reconstruction, _*kawa-kawa_ ‘_Terapon jarbua_, crescent perch’, based on
Niuatoputapu and E Uvean _kava-kava_, Samoan _ʔava-ʔava_, all ‘_Terapon jarbua_’ but none for
a higher order interstage. POc _*kawa-kawa_ ‘rock cod, grouper’ (§22) is considered unrelated.

2.36 Emperors and large-eyed breams (Lethrinidae)

Figure 2.18: _Lethrinus variegatus_, variegated emperor

Emperors inhabit shallow coastal waters around rocky outcrops and coral reefs, moving
in schools. Most are fairly brightly coloured
in shades of red and green. Their flesh is excellent (Munro 1967: p.324). Four genera are identified,
_Lethrinus_, _Gnathodentex_, _Gymnocranius_ and _Monotaxis_. We have seven POc reconstructions, but
in a number of instances their reflexes have come to be applied to
different referents in daughter languages. In such cases reconstructions are simply labelled
Lethrinidae or _Lethrinus_ spp.

In the following set there has been confusion with reflexes of POc _*(k,q)ulapi)_ ‘parrotfish’
(§47) in Tokelauan.

[21] _Lethrinus miniatus_ is the trumpet emperor, a different fish from _L. olivaceus_. the long-nosed emperor, albeit one with which it is often confused. _Lethrinus elongatus_ is a synonym for _L. olivaceus_, ‘long-nosed emperor’

2.37 Goatfishes (Mullidae)

Figure 2.19: _Parupeneus signatus_, black-spotted goatfish

The Mullidae have large scales and two barbels
at the chin. Small to moderate in size and usually red or gold, they are bottom-dwellers, often
occurring in large schools (Munro 1967: p.334). Genera include _Mulloidichthys_, _Parupeneus_, _Upeneus_
and _Pseudupeneus_. Both in Andra (Adm) (McEldowney 1995) and Kapingamarangi (Pn) (Lieber 1994),
goatfish are reported as particularly numerous in stone fishtrap catches. Most species
are considered good eating. We have five POc reconstructions, one of which is traceable with
consistent referent back to PAn, and one which probably refers
to a growth stage.

    The PPn reconstruction in the next set appears to be an old compound, but the meaning
of _*-ama_ is unknown.


[25] Geraghty (2010) argues that PPn _*wete_ may be a regular reflex of PCP _*teu_ involving the following changes:
 (i) lowering of the final vowel to _*o_. (ii) breaking of the vowel _o_ as _we_, and (iii) metathesis to _*wete_. He has
 tracked the same series of changes in PCP _*deu_ ‘unravel’ > PPn _*wete_ ‘untie’.

[26] Admiralties terms apparently reflect Proto Admiralty _*mʷacasei_ with some irregularities. Most other items
 reflect POc _*mʷacasi_.

2.38 Sweepers (Pempheridae)

Sweepers are a small family of nocturnal fishes that spend daylight hours in caves and crevices
of the reef. They sometimes form large aggregations which disperse after dusk and feed on
zooplankton during the night (Allen & Swainston 1993:58). They are dusky silver or bright
red, most with very large eyes (Munro 1967: p.349).

    No POc reconstruction has been made. A lower level reconstruction includes PCP _*manivi_
‘_Pempheris_ sp.’ (Geraghty p.155), PPn _*manifi_ ‘_Pempheris oualensis_’ (Hooper 1994: p.213) (cf.

2.39 Drummers, rudderfishes (Kyphosidae)

Figure 2.20: _Kyphosus cinerascens_, ashen drummer

Drummers or rudderfishes are a small family. Fishes are typically small, finely and closely scaled, and dull
in colour. Most species are pelagic, often found under floating medusae. They are herbivorous fish, feeding
chiefly on algae and seaweed. The flesh is regarded as edible but of poor quality (Munro 1967: p.352).

2.40 Silver batfishes, diamondfishes (Monodactylidae)

These are small, deep-bodied, compressed fishes, distinguished by their diamond shape and
silvery colour and superficially resembling the juveniles of batfishes. They inhabit shallow
coastal waters, preferring brackish water and sometimes penetrating into fresh water (Munro
p.348). No widespread cognate sets have been found.


2.41 Batfishes (Ephippidae (formerly Platacidae))

Allen & Swainston (1993:58) describe the batfishes of the genus _Platax_ as among the most
graceful of coral reef fishes. They are characterised by long, flowing fins, particularly in their
juvenile and sub-adult stages. Adults have almost round bodies. Young ones resemble a leaf
in colour and can sink inertly through the water, becoming difficult to see. Batfish are often
extremely tame and curious. They are found both on sheltered inshore reefs and on outer
 slopes.

2.42 Butterflyfishes, coralfishes (Chaetodontidae)

Butterflyfish are among the most readily recognised of coral reef fishes due to their graceful
shapes and wide range of brilliant colour patterns. Colours are usually combinations of
black, red, orange, yellow and white. The fishes are diurnal and some species are extremely
territorial, inhabiting one or more heads of plate coral. At dusk they retreat to reef crevices
where they remain motionless until dawn (Allen & Swainston 1993:60).

Figure 2.21: _Chaetodon_ sp., coralfish

     Both Hooper (1994: p. 188) and Hviding (1996:192) have commented on the fact that in Oceanic
languages butterflyfish, coralfish and angelfish are sometimes lumped together under one generic
term, although angelfish belong in a separate family, Pomacanthidae. Chaetodontidae are of
little value for food, and there is apparently little point in distinguishing species or growth
stages. I have two POc reconstructions, which presumably contrasted in meaning, but reflexes of
both  _*bebek_ and _*tipi-tipi_ have in some languages been used as the generic form for
butterflyfish, coralfish, and perhaps others, and I have been
unable to differentiate between their meanings. Although the final _*-k_ of _*bebek_ is not
supported by the evidence given here, there can be no doubt that the same word in POc referred
to both ‘butterfly’ and ‘butterflyfish’.

2.43 Angelfishes (Pomacanthidae)

Angelfish are small to moderate-sized marine fish, frequenting coral reefs. They are close
relatives of butterflyfish and the two families are sometimes included within the same term in
local nomenclature. Like butterflyfish, they have extremely brilliant colours and complicated
patterns. However, they can be distinguished by possession of a prominent cheek spine which
can inflict a painful wound if handled carelessly. Some undergo astonishing changes in colour
and markings with age. Larger ones are valued as food (Munro 1967: p.371).

2.44 Damselfishes or demoiselles, anemonefishes, sergeant-majors, pullers (Pomacentridae)

Figure 2.22: _Adudefduf_ sp., sergeant-major

These are very active brilliant little fishes of the coral reefs, seeking shelter among branches of
coral and in crevices. They are often left in tide pools. They are trim and shapely, greatly
suggesting butterflyfish in mode of life. Coloration is highly variable, ranging from grey to
yellow to blue. Genera include _Pomacentrus_ (damselfish),
_Amphiprion_ (anemonefish, clownfish), _Abudefduf_ (sergeant-majors) and _Chromis_ (pullers), and
there are dozens of species. Two POc terms are
reconstructed, the second one, _*taku-takuŋ_, possibly the term for juveniles, those of many species
being distinctively marked by a yellow body with bright blue stripes (Allen & Swainston 1993:74).

2.45 Hawkfishes (Cirrhitidae)

Many Cirrhitidae are richly coloured and abundant about coral reefs and rocks. They are
solitary and sedentary, frequently seen sitting on top of coral heads, from which they make
quick short darts for food (Munro 1967: p.442). Two reconstructions are possible at PPn level,
_*patuki_ (Geraghty p.157) and _*qulu-tuki_ (Hooper p.206). Their association with _*tuki_ ‘to

Figure 2.23:   _Cheilinus undulatus_, double-headed Maori wrasse

2.46 Wrasses, tuskfishes (Labridae)

There are over 400 species of Labridae, falling into some 60 genera which include _Anampses_,
_Bodianus_, _Cheilinus_ (Maori wrasse), _Choerodon_ (tuskfish), _Coris_, _Epibulus_, _Gomphosus_,
_Halichoeres_ and _Thalassoma_. Wrasses are brilliantly coloured, living around coral reefs and
amongst weeds. Juvenile wrasses often differ from adults, and in some the sexes differ in
colour and pattern. Some change colour and pattern with great rapidity (Munro 1967: pp.402, 405).
They are active during daylight hours, retiring to the shelter of the reef at night. Some species,
such as members of the genus _Coris_, bury themselves in the sand. Most are medium sized
fishes (about 20-40 cm), but the double-headed Maori wrasse, _Cheilinus undulatus_, is notable
for its size, growing to over two metres in length. Oceanic languages typically distinguish
many wrasse taxa. Although I have a number of POc reconstructions, there is little consistency
of reference within cognate sets, other than within Polynesia. So, although in each case
the POc meaning may have been restricted to one or more species, or even to growth stages,
I am obliged to reconstruct in very general terms. In the following set, the Rotuman reflex of
_*mamin_ refers not to the Maori wrasse, but to the largest parrotfish, the hump-headed parrotfish,
_Bolbometopon muricatum_, which resembles it. Although Geraghty (1994: p.159) reconstructs
PCP _*mami_ ‘_Bolbometopon_, hump-headed parrotfish’, he does so presumably on Rotuman
evidence alone.

2.47 Parrotfishes (Scaridae)

Figure 2.24: Bolbometopon muricatum, double-headed parrotfish

Parrotfish are closely related to the wrasses, although the latter are carnivorous. Parrotfish are
herbivorous, typically large, the jaws with a bony beak. They are reef dwellers, feeding chiefly
on vegetable matter, but their strong beaks easily crush molluscs and coral. Most pass
through one to three colour phases. Juveniles are usually plain, with mottling; immatures usually patterned
with red, brown or purple, adults with blue, green, yellow, orange or red patterns (Munro 1967: p.431). Like the
wrasses they retreat into holes in the coral at night to sleep. Genera include _Scarus_, _Hipposcarus_ and _Bolbometopon_.

    The double-headed or hump-headed parrotfish, _Bolbometopon muricatum_, is distinguished
by its size and the hump on its forehead. While most species of parrotfish are under 50 cm in
length, the hump-headed parrotfish can reach 120 cm or more. The Admiralties forms below
indicate that there was a final POc consonant, probably _*-q_.

2.49 Gobies, including mudskippers (Gobiidae), blennies (Blenniidae)

Gobies are very small sluggish fishes abundant about reefs and coral. They are usually found
sheltering among weeds, under stones or in crevices, in rock pools and quiet water (Munro
p.493). They constitute the largest family of marine fishes worldwide with several hundred
species in New Guinea alone, but the paucity of terms in dictionaries for gobies suggests they
are of little importance. There are some freshwater species. Mudskippers or land gobies can
leave the water and hop or crawl over rocks or mud in search of food. They were formerly
classified as Periopthalmidae, but are now considered a sub-family of Gobiidae. Blennies are
small carnivorous fishes, living mainly in rock pools in the intertidal zone. They rarely swim
free and spend most of their time concealed. Oceanic languages often group them with gobies
which inhabit similar environments.

2.50 Sleepers, gudgeons (Eleotridae)

These fish are similar to gobies in their habit of lying on the bottom and rarely moving. Some
species hover in cloud-like swarms over coral heads. Most are small and insignificant but
there are some fresh water species which grow larger and are valued food fish in inland areas

2.52 Flatheads (Platycephalidae)

These moderate-sized fish are adapted for life on the bottom where they bury themselves in
sand with only the eyes exposed. Most are excellent eating (Munro 1967: p.526). Thus it is
surprising that few terms have been recorded from contemporary languages and no reconstructions
made.


2.53 Moorish idols (Zanclidae)

Moorish idols superficially resemble butterflyfish, with strongly marked bands of black,
white and yellow, but have a distinctive protruding snout. They are found around coral reefs
in shallow water. Formerly two species were recognised, _Zanclus canescens_ and _Z. cornutus_,
but the former is now considered the juvenile form of the latter (Kailola p.459, FishBase).
Hooper (p.215) has reconstructed PNPn _*laulau-fau_ ‘_Zanclus canescens_, Moorish idol’.


2.54 Unicornfishes, surgeonfishes, bristletooths, tangs (Acanthuridae)

Figure 2.25: _Naso unicornis_, long-snouted unicornfish

All Acanthuridae are herbivorous coral reef fish, scraping algae with their fine
teeth. Genera include _Naso_, _Acanthurus_, _Zebrasoma_ and _Ctenochaetus_. They have
thick leathery skin and a spine with one or more knife-like barbs on the tail which
are capable of severe wounding. Surgeonfish are so named because of these lancetlike spines,
unicorn fish because of the horn-like projection on the forehead. Juveniles differ greatly and
are usually separately named in vernacular nomenclatures
(Munro 1967: p.482). More POc reconstructions have been made for Acanthuridae than for
any other family. Three refer to the genus Naso ‘unicornfish’, but only one, _*qume_, clearly
refers to a single species, _Naso unicornis_.

    A number of terms for surgeonfish have been reconstructed. The following reconstruction,
POc _*piRa(q)_, is identical in form with the term for _Alocasia_, swamp taro, which, like
_Zebrasoma veliferum_, is unpalatably acid unless the skin is carefully removed (Geraghty 1990:78).
A parallel development is found in Rotuman, where _ʔapea_ means both ‘swamp
taro’ and ‘sailfin tang’.

Figure 2.27: _Siganus punctatus_, gold-spotted spinefoot

2.55 Rabbitfishes, spinefeet (Siganidae)

Rabbitfish or spinefeet are herbivorous fish, inhabiting grassy shallow waters. Their fin spines
are very sharp and can inflict painful stings. They have characteristic rabbit-shaped heads.
Their flesh is edible. Oceanic languages usually distinguish several taxa. Two Polynesian
terms in the next set refer instead to Epinephelidae which resemble the Siganidae in having
dangerous spines.

2.56 Snake mackerels, oilfishes (Gempylidae)

Snake mackerels (_Gempylus serpens_, _Promethichthys prometheus_, _Ruvettus pretiosus_) inhabit deeper
coastal and oceanic waters, and are sometimes found at depths as great as 600
metres. The flesh is edible but oily. Davis (1999: 164) writes that _Ruvettus pretiosus_ is so oily
that eating even a small amount of its flesh has a strongly laxative effect. In some parts of
Polynesia _R. pretiosus_ is known by reflexes of PPn _*palu_, whose range of reference may also
include jobfish and other deep-sea snappers. Both oilfish and deep-sea snappers are found at
great depths (§30). As mentioned earlier (p.78), the ability to fish water at these depths was
probably a late Samoic-Outlier innovation. Some local terminologies group snake mackerels
with barracudas, also elongated and slender with powerful dentition. In places they may also
be identified with catfish (Pukapukan and Tokelauan _kapoa_ ‘Promethichthys prometheus’ >
POc _*kaboRa_ ‘catfish’). _P. prometheus_ has also been known as Bermuda catfish. Hooper has
reconstructed PPn _*maŋā_ ‘k.o. fish’ with meaning in Eastern Polynesian languages
‘_Promethichthys prometheus_, snake mackerel’.

2.57 Skipjacks, Spanish mackerels, mackerels, tunas, tunnies, albacores, wahoos (Scombridae)

Munro recognised distinct families: Katsuwonidae (skipjack and dogtooth tuna), Scombero-moridae
(Spanish mackerel), Scombridae (mackerel), Thunnidae (albacore, tunnies, big eye,
bluefin and yellowfin tuna), and Acanthocybidae (wahoo), but these have now been combined
as one family, Scombridae (Kailola (1987:467, FishBase). These fish are mostly large, fast
surface predators, highly regarded both for food and sport. There is considerable variation
in English glosses within cognate sets, due possibly to variable popular usage of terms like
tuna, bonito, tunny and mackerel by wordlist compilers. In particular, although the English
vernacular term bonito typically refers to _Katsuwonus pelamis_ (skipjack), it is sometimes
extended to include any pelagic fish caught by trolling from fast canoes, including _Katsuwonus_,
_Gymnosarda_ and _Thunnus_. Reflexes of POc _*qatun_ may be similarly applied in both
narrow and extended senses. _Katsuwonus_ (skipjacks) and _Gymnosarda_ (dogtooth tunas) are
generally distinguished from _Thunnus_ (true tunas) by the former’s apparently scaleless body.
Most skipjacks (bonito) are school fishes, found around the outer edges of reefs where they
can be taken by trolling. They travel in large schools offshore along the coast at certain 
seasons, the schools often boiling at the surface. These fish have a special role in many parts
of the Oceanic world. Simbo speakers in the NW Solomons divide fin fishes into three categories: 
_baɣea_ ‘sharks’, _iso_ ‘bonito’ and _iɣana_ ‘generic for all fish other than sharks and
bonito’ (Bill Palmer pers. comm.). Ivens (1927:130) writes that “to the Melanesian of the
Southeast Solomons the catching of the bonito is one of the things for which he exists. To
him it is the king of fish”. Solomon Islanders incorporate them in initiating ceremonies and
associate them with various taboos (1927:130-131, 314, 329-330). Many different names
are used for bonito in particular roles, a reflection of their importance in these communities.
In similar vein, bonito fishing in Kapingamarangi is described by local fishermen as “their
sport of kings” (Lieber 1994:77). In Tonga also, the bonito is considered the king of fish (Dye
1983:251-2).

    Blust (2002:130) notes that Tagalog is the only non-Oceanic language known to have a
presumptive cognate, _atun_ ‘tunny fish’, albeit with an unexpected high vowel, and concludes
that ‘_*qatun_ probably was a lexical innovation in POc and that the early Spanish explorers in
the Pacific borrowed the term from an Oceanic language (most likely in the western Solomon
Islands) that preserved final consonants, and then introduced it into the Philippines’.

    _Scomberomorus_ (Spanish mackerels) are moderate to large predatory fishes occurring in
schools in coastal waters. Larger ones are caught by trolling near the surface in the vicinity 
of coral reefs, rocky headlands and sunken shoals. Flesh is white, sweet, rather boneless
and highly esteemed. There are perhaps four species of _Scomberomorus_. The largest, _Scomberomorus commerson_,
the narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, has been known to grow to over two metres,
although average size is considerably smaller (Munro 1967: p.200). Although the following PMP
reconstruction is glossed ‘_Scomberomorus commerson_, Spanish mackerel’, Oceanic cognates do not support
a species-specific gloss for POc.

   _Scomber_ and _Rastrelliger_ (mackerels) are small to moderate pelagic fishes, typically under
a metre in length, which migrate in schools and comprise some of the more important
food fishes of the world. Munro (p. 197) reports that they inhabit shallow coastal New Guinea
waters where they are caught by seines or fixed traps.

over the continental shelf and may be taken by trolling around reefs. Flesh, usually dark, is
excellent, one species dubbed ‘chicken of the sea’ (Munro 1967: p.200).

    François (2005:499) reconstructs PNCV _*rowou_ ‘bonito, _Thunnus_ sp.’.
Hooper has PNPn _*kakasi_ ‘_Thunnus albacares_, yellowfin tuna’, possibly related to the Marovo
and Roviana terms for bonito, _makasi_. The wahoo, _Acanthocybium solandri_, is the sole member of
its genus. It is solitary, pelagic, has fine sweet flesh and is rated a splendid sporting
fish. The only reconstruction, PPn _*paqala_ ‘_Acanthocybium solandri_, wahoo’ is from Hooper
(p.222). In Wayan and Tongan the term for a wahoo is a taxon of PCP _*walu_.


2.58 Marlins and sailfishes (Istiophoridae); swordfishes (Xiphiidae)
                                                       
Figure 2.30: _Istiophorus platypterus_, Pacific sailfish

The Istiophoridae are identified by an upper jaw in the form of a long sword. They
are big-game fish, large, fast and powerful, and pelagic in open waters. Three marlins are
recognised, _Makaira indica_ (black marlin), _M. mazara_ (blue marlin) and Tetrapturus audax
(striped marlin). The sailfish (_Istiophorus platypterus_) has an extremely elevated dorsal
fin forming a sail-like structure which folds
into a groove. The swordfish (_Xiphias gladius_) is readily known by its particularly long blade-like rostrum. The adult swordfish differs
from the marlin and sailfish in having no scales. The name for the sailfish in PMP and POc,
 _*saku-layaR_, is a compound, derived from _*saku_ ‘needlefish, garfish, long toms’ (§13) plus
 _*layaR_ ‘sail’ (see vol.1, p. 194). Referential range in reflexes often includes swordfishes and
marlin as well as sailfishes, although the first two lack the sail-like dorsal fin.

    There is a second term which probably refered to a particular species or subgroup of

whose fronds resemble the large dorsal fin of the sailfish.

2.59 Flounders and soles: left-eye flounders (Bothidae), toothed flounders (Paralichthyidae), right-eye flounders (Pleuronectidae), soles (Soleidae)

Flatfishes are poorly represented in tropical waters in comparison with their abundance in
cooler regions. Flounders, toothed flounders and soles are bilaterally asymmetrical, adapted
for life on the bottom where they bury themselves in sand or mud. Most inhabit shallow
coastal waters and estuaries. Larger ones are good eating (Munro 1967: p.124). Flatheads have a
similar habit of burying themselves in sand, but lack the distinctive oval shape of flounders
and soles. Many contemporary languages have a generic term for flatfishes. We have two
reconstructions, both with generalised gloss. In the next set both POc _*alali_ and _*lalali_ are
reflected.

Figure 2.31: _Synanceia verrucosa_, reef stonefish

Scorpionfishes and lionfishes were formerly included with stonefishes as Scorpaenidae, but
stonefishes have now been classified as a separate family, Synanceiidae. The latter are
shallowwater fishes, very sluggish, spending most of their life concealed in mud or among rocks
and coral. Most have grotesquely misshapen heads and bodies covered with rough warty
skin. If trodden on, they can inject an extremely painful neurotoxin which, in some cases, has
proved fatal to man (Munro 1967: p.538). Reflexes of POc _*[ñ,n]opu(q)_ are numerous and widespread.
Most Oceanic languages have merged /ñ/ and /n/, so provide no evidence for choosing between
competing reconstructions, but Sudest reflects _*ñ_ only, while Titan, Loniu and Wayan reflect _n_
only. Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests the _i_ of the Naman term _(ni)niv_ might be evidence supporting
initial _*ñ-_. Although the referent is consistent throughout almost all Western Oceanic
languages, it has apparently become a generic for fishes with poisonous spines, including at
least some scorpionfishes in Micronesia, Wayan Fijian and parts of Polynesia.

2.61 Triggerfishes (Balistidae); filefishes and leatherjackets (Monacanthidae)


                                                                                                  Fish     121

Figure 2.32: Monacanthus sp., scribbled leatherjacket


Triggerfishes (Balistidae) are characterised by a football shape, leathery skin, and small
mouth with powerful jaws. They are feeble swimmers, herbivorous, generally solitary in
habit, seeking shelter among coral heads and weeds. The flesh of many is poisonous, although
others are used for food (Munro 1967: p.557). Closely related to Balistidae are the Monacanthidae
(formerly Aluteridae), leatherjackets and filefishes. They differ from triggerfish in skin texture,
leatherjackets having a leathery skin while that of filefish is rough and velvety (Munro
p.564). Four POc terms are reconstructable, with _*jumu_ the most likely candidate for a generic
term. _*bubu_ and _*[bʷaRu]bʷaRu_ may, like _*lio-lio_, have had more specific reference.
Variability of gloss frequently indicates only variability of common names for the same species.
For instance, common names for Pseudobalistesfuscus include the yellow-spotted triggerfish
(Allen & Swainston) or brown triggerfish (Kailola). Although juveniles have yellow lines and
spots, adults have overall dark coloration.

2.62 Boxfishes, trunkfishes, cowfishes (Ostraciidae)

Members of this family are bottom dwellers in shallow water often around coral reefs. Normal scales have been replaced by bony plates fused into a hard box-like carapace. Mouth,
eyes and fins are the only movable parts. All are extremely shy, feeble swimmers, but some
are beautifully coloured. Some are reputed to have toxic flesh (Munro 1967: p.571). The next reconstruction is suspiciously similar to POc _*[bʷaRu]bʷaRu_ ‘_Balistes_ taxon, triggerfish’, on
page 122, but this seems due to chance, as the glosses clearly allow a separate reconstruction.

suggested Proto Central Vanuatu _*mʷatoqu_ ‘boxfish, Ostracion’ (Paamese (u)matou, Namakir
_mʷa-mʷatoq_, Nguna _mʷatou_) which has echoes of both. There is also the possibility of
parallel development, an outstanding characteristic of this fish being its resemblance in taste

2.63 Puffers, toadfishes and blowfishes (Tetraodontidae); porcupinefishes and balloonfishes (Diodontidae)

Puffers are sluggish fish which fill the belly with air when disturbed, and then float to the
surface. They are feeble swimmers. Closely related are porcupine fish which are also selfinflating,
but distinguished by having moveable spines on head and body. Both are bottom
dwellers, and the flesh of both is toxic (Munro 1967: pp.545, 548). Although ACD glosses PMP
_*taRutum_ as ‘porcupinefish, puffer fish, _Diodon_ sp.’, the WMP and CMP reflexes listed refer only
to porcupinefish, and the reference to pufferfish is no doubt to the spiny puffer, an
alternative name for porcupinefish. In Ambon (CEMP) a reflex is the term for a durian and
in Ponape (Mic) a term for both the fish and a soursop (also a fruit with prickles), while in
languages of Borneo (Kelabit, Katingan) and the Lesser Sundas (Manggarai, Lamaholot) reflexes mean
‘porcupine’. Both emphasise the semantic connection with porcupinefish rather
than the smooth pufferfish. Blust (2002:130) considers that because porcupines (the mammals) are
not found in the Philippines where PMP was presumably spoken, the term’s original
reference was to ‘porcupinefish’.

2.64 Flying gurnards (Dactylopteridae)

Flying gurnards are semipelagic, with lesser powers of flight than the true flying fish. They
are heavily armoured, with enormous wing-like pectorals. Essentially bottom dwellers, they
are capable of short clumsy glide-like flights (Munro 1967: p. 541). Geraghty (1994: p. 149) proposes PFij
_*lulu_, but no higher-level reconstruction has been made.


2.65 Remoras (Echeneididae)

Remoras (_Echeneis naucrates_ and _Remora remora_), also known as suckerfish, have a modified
adhesive disk on the upper surface of the head with which they attach themselves to large
floating objects, frequently sharks. The Gela (SES) term for remoras is _rao-rago bagea_,
literally ‘joined to sharks’. I have no POc reconstruction for remora. I noted in §4 that the Motu
reflex of POc _*maŋewa_ ‘k.o. shark’ and the PCP reflex of _*bakewa_ ‘shark (generic)’ denote
the remora, not the shark. Hooper (1994: p.216) proposes PPn _*tali-tali-quli_ ‘Echeneis sp., remora,
and _Naucrates ductor_, pilot fish’ with suggested etymology _*tali-tali_ ‘wait upon’ and _*quli_
‘to steer’.

A POc verb, _*qunapi-_ ‘scale a fish’ can be reconstructed, and it appears that a noun _*qunapi_
‘fishscales’ was derived by back-formation in POc, existing as a doublet alongside _*qunap_.

2.66.4 Fins

Many languages distinguish between pectoral (breast), dorsal (back), caudal (tail) and ventral
(abdominal) fins. Reconstructions have been made for the first two. The reconstruction of the
next etymon, POc _*banic_ ‘arm, hand, wing, fin (probably pectoral)’, entails some minor formal
problems. All cognates reflect initial _*b-_ except those in the Central Papuan languages
Balawaia, Motu and Mekeo, which reflect _*p-_. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _*pani(d,j)_ with
either _*-d_ or _*-j_ as final consonant. The only Oceanic reflex with an etymological final consonant
is Vitu _baniti-_, pointing to POc _*-t_ or _*-c_. The most straightforward analysis is that PMP
_*panij_ became POc _*banic_ by regular sound change. The final consonants of Wampur _bani-t_
and Mapos Buang _bani-s_ can be ignored, as they reflect a probable construct suffix found
on inalienably possessed nouns in Huon Gulf languages. The POc meaning of this term had
clearly been extended beyond ‘wing’ to include the pectoral fins of fish, the wings of birds
and the arms of human beings.

Similarly, a number of Papuan Tip languages, Gumawana _pane-panena_, Molima _pape_, Wedau

2.67 Conclusion

In this chapter I have reconstructed around 145 Proto Oceanic names for fish spread across
approximately eighty families. All reconstructions bar one are uninomials, the only binomial
reconstructable to POc level being _*paRi-manuk_ ‘_Aetobatus narinari_, spotted eagle ray’.
Uninomials can refer to fish at the family, genus or species level, and in the case of sharks
(_*bakewa_) and rays (_*paRi_), at the level of suborder. In a number of cases I have been able to
identify a reconstruction as ageneric. Examples include _*bakewa_ ‘sharks’, _*paRi_ ‘ray’, _*saku_
 ‘needlefish’, _*taRaqam_ ‘squirrelfish’, _*kanase_ ‘mullet spp.’, _*tuna_ ‘fresh water eels’, _*qonos_
 ‘_Sphyraena_, barracudas’. Generics may form the headword in a binomial subsuming two or
more species, or may simply be used to include two or more subtaxa. Another kind of generic
is that illustrated by _*bebek_ ‘generic for butterflyfish, coralfish’, which is simply a lumped
 category with no sub-taxa. In some instances it has been possible to link a reconstruction to
 a particular species. However, for the majority of reconstructions it has only been possible
to allocate an identity at the level of genus or family. Undoubtedly, POc fish nomenclature
would have included scores of binomials, commonly at the level of species. My inability
to reconstruct them is due partly to lack of detail in wordlists, but also to the likelihood of
 species variability across the region together with the apparent tendency of binomials to be
local innovations. Most languages also have terms, usually binomial, for categories that cut
 across Linnaean categories, grouping fishes by functional criteria rather than by morphology
 or behaviour. Satawal, for instance, has taxa which identify such categories as flying fish,
jumping fish, unpalatable fish, fish prohibited for women and children to eat, fish prohibited
for pregnant and menstruating women, fish given preferentially to the chief, and fish that
follow driftwood (Akimichi & Sauchomal 1982:25-6). Such terms also tend to be local innovations.
Andrew Pawley has argued that Proto Oceanic probably had around 400 terms for
fish (this volume, ch.3). The substantial number of reconstructions that exist for Proto Central
Pacific and Proto Polynesian is largely due to the work of Paul Geraghty and Robin Hooper,
building on Biggs & Clark (1993). Although Western Oceanic has far more languages than
PCP, we have few wordlists from there which provide good descriptions of fish nomenclature.
With the addition of more detailed wordlists from Western Oceanic languages, it should
be possible for researchers not only to reconstruct more terms, but to further refine the glosses
for those we have.

3 Patterns of stability and change in Oceanic fish names


3.1 Introduction

Some years ago, in a paper reconstructing Proto Polynesian (PPn) fish names, Robin Hooper
suggested that ‘fishing terms and fish names are good candidates for inclusion in core vocabulary
lists for Polynesian languages’ (Hooper 1994:187-8).[1] She meant that names for
kinds of fish and fishing methods may prove to be as stable as words in standard basic vocabulary
lists, such as the Swadesh 100 and 200 word lists. Stability in the lexicon can be
defined, operationally, in terms of retention rates of particular etyma in daughter languages.
Her suggestion rested on the observations that Polynesian fish names ‘reveal a high degree
of uniformity and semantic correspondence …, which is attributable to a comparative uniformity
in the ichthyological fauna of the tropical South Pacific’ (Hooper 1994:186) and that in
Polynesian communities fishing has great economic and cultural importance. Hooper did not
undertake a close statistical analysis of retention rates for fish names or other fishing terms
but her remarks invite such a study.

    In this chapter I will investigate the stability of 52 of the 140 or so fish names that have
been reconstructed to the level of Proto Oceanic (POc), a language spoken more than 3000
years ago. Examination of a sample of contemporary Oceanic languages shows that POc
names for some fish taxa have been extremely persistent, others have been much less so, and
yet others occupy the middle ground. This leads to the question: Why have some names been
much more (or less) stable than others?

    I will also draw on evidence from contemporary languages to estimate the total number
of fish names likely to have been used by speakers of POc. Osmond (this volume, ch. 2)
reconstructs some 145 POc names for fish taxa, of which 140 look to be well attested in
terms of having reflexes distributed across more than one primary subgroup. Hooper (1994)
reconstructed 115 fish names for PPn, and for Proto Nuclear Polynesian, a stage ancestral to
all Polynesian languages except Tongan and Niuean, she reconstructed 147. Geraghty (1994)
was able to recover some 150 secure terms for Proto Central Pacific, the immediate ancestor
of Polynesian, Fijian and Rotuman.

[1] I dedicate this paper to the memory of Phil Quick, whose research on the Pendau language of Sulawesi included
detailed study of Pendau fish names and fishing knowledge (Quick 2005. 2010). I am indebted to Meredith
Osmond for carefully checking the details of all the tables and for thorough-going critical commentary on an
earlier draft, and to Malcolm Ross for helpful comments.

138   Andrew Paw ley


     Comparative analysis of contemporary lexicons for fishing communities speaking Oceanic
languages and exploiting environments comparable to those of the Bismarck Archipelago, the
probable location of POc, indicates that speakers of POc probably distinguished on the order
of 400 names for kinds of fish. In that case the total of about 140 fish names so far reconstructed
for POc represents about a third of the total. The question arises why so many names
are missing from the reconstructed inventory.


3.1.1 On the distribution of fish families, genera and species in the Pacific

R.H. Carcasson writes as follows of the fish fauna of the tropical Indo-Pacific region:

|      A surprisingly high proportion of Indo-Pacific species occur throughout the area: the
|      Central Indo-Pacific. consisting roughly of the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines and
|      New Guinea, has a richer fauna than any other part of the Region and has probably been
|      the principal evolutionary centre from which the entire Indo-Pacific has been populated.
|      As one moves away from this area, the fauna becomes progressively impoverished …
|      (Carcasson 1977:13).

More than 150 families of fish occur in the Indo-Pacific region. Although the number of genera and
species declines as one moves eastwards from New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, the dominant
families (those with most species, e.g. the wrasses, groupers, trevallies
and jacks, damselfishes, cardinalfishes, surgeonfishes, gobies and moray eels) are present
throughout the region.

    The Bismarck Archipelago, the probable location of the POc speech community, is richer
in marine life than any other region in the South Pacific apart from New Guinea. The coral
reef systems of this region support several thousand species and several hundred genera.


3.1.2 The location and dating of Proto Oceanic

As we are concerned with retention rates of POc lexical items it is relevant to ask what time
span is involved. The breakup of POc can be dated with considerable confidence to between
3400 and 3100 BP. POc was almost certainly spoken in the Bismarck Archipelago, where the
greatest concentration of primary subgroups of Oceanic is found today. Dating of its breakup
to within a span of two or three centuries is possible because of the strong association between
the appearance in the Bismarck Archipelago and subsequent spread across the SW Pacific of
the highly distinctive archaeological culture known as Lapita and the initial diversification of
Proto Oceanic within the Bismarcks and the subsequent spread of Oceanic languages across
the SW Pacific (Green 2003, Kirch 1997, 2000, Pawley 2003c, 2007, 2008, Spriggs 1997a,
Summerhayes 2001).

                                                  Stability and change in Oceanic fish names             139

    The latest critical reviews of C14 dates indicate that Lapita appeared in the Bismarcks
around 3400-3450 BP (Specht 2007). By 3200-3100 BP bearers of this culture had settled
the Reefs-Santa Cruz group, east of the main Solomons group (Green 2003, Green et al. 2008),
and by about 3000 BP or earlier they had occupied Vanuatu (Bedford 2003, 2006),
New Caledonia (Sand 2003) and Fiji (Nunn et al. 2004, Clark and Anderson 2009). By 2900
Lapita populations were present in the southern part of the Tongan group (Burley and Connaughton 2007)
and by 2800-2700 they were in Samoa and the small islands between Tonga
and Samoa: Futuna, Uvea (Wallis) and Niuatoputapu (Clark and Anderson 2009).

    The carriers of Lapita material culture were, almost certainly, the first people to settle the
Reefs-Santa Cruz group, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and western Polynesia. Given that all
these regions were occupied within 300-600 years of the first appearance of Lapita in the
Bismarcks, we would expect that their first colonists spoke forms of Oceanic that were not
greatly differentiated from their common ancestor, Proto Oceanic.[2]

[2] For example, the Proto Central Pacific (PCP) dialect complex, immediately ancestral to the
Fijian and Polynesian languages and Rotuman, can be equated with the first couple of centuries of Lapita settlement in Fiji.
 PCP retained about 91 percent of POc basic vocabulary on a 200 item list (Pawley 2010).


3.2 Methodological preliminaries

Before proceeding to an analysis of the data on fish names we should consider some methodological issues.


3.2.1 Datasources

The descriptions available on fish names and taxonomies in Oceanic languages are very uneven in
quality and quantity. Although there are reasonably good general dictionaries for
about 50 of the 450 or so languages in the Oceanic group only a handful provide something
close to a comprehensive list of fish names together with scientific identifications and
information about the indigenous taxonomy. In addition there are a few published papers and
unpublished works that provide fairly extensive data. The statistical data cited in this paper
are based on materials from a sample of 15 Oceanic languages plus a non-Oceanic language of
Micronesia, Palauan, and a Malayo-Polynesian language of Sulawesi, Pendau (see Table 3.1).


3.2.2 On taxonomies and nomenclatures

3.2.2.1 Folk taxonomies

The core of a folk taxonomy is a set of named categories (taxa) that form a semantic hierarchy
in which all taxa are related by virtue of being included in a higher order category or by virtue
of including lower order taxa. A term that includes two or more named subtaxa is a generic
taxon. There may also be covert taxa, conceptual categories whose unity is indicated by other
means than sharing a class name. For example, for many English speakers horses, zebras and
donkeys form a covert category (horse-like animals), as do dogs and wolves. A distinction
needs to be made between the core categories in the taxonomic hierarchy and other kinds of
categories that crosscut these, e.g. ecological categories, like ‘fish of the reef’ vs ‘fish of the
deep sea’, and functional categories, like ‘poisonous fish’.

3.2.2.2 Uninomials vs binomials

An important distinction is between _uninomial_ and _binomial_ names, sometimes called primary and
secondary terms. Uninomials are names that are either a single morpheme (_oak_,
_pine_, _apple_) or are multimorphemic but with meanings that are idiomatic (_she-oak_,
_screw pine_). A _screw pine_ (pandanus) is not a kind of pine, and a _she-oak_ (casuarina) is not a kind
of oak. Binomials consist of a uninomial term plus a modifier, where the uninomial names
the class and the modifier distinguishes members of the class (i.e. a _white pine_ and
_redwood pine_ are kinds of pine, and _white pointer shark_ and _hammerhead shark_ are kinds of shark).
Uninomials typically name taxa at the level of what Berlin (1992) calls ‘folk generics’. These
are taxa that belong to a particular major generic or ‘life form’ such as ‘fish’, ‘bird’ and ‘tree’
and which themselves may contain subtaxa that are designated by binomials.

    Binomials provided by native speakers need to be viewed with some caution.
When informants are asked to name or discriminate between specimens they sometimes offer _ad hoc_
descriptions, such as ‘spotted X’, or ‘red X’, which the investigator may mistake for genuine
conventional names. Independent checks with a range of informants are desirable but not
always possible.


3.2.3 On counting the units in a taxonomy

                                             Stability and change in Oceanic fish names        141

Counting the number of lexical units in a folk taxonomy is not completely straightforward.
There are several ways of counting members, which give different results. First, one can count
the _total number of terms_ that represent taxa. Each formally distinct term is counted separately
even if it has synonyms, e.g. Australian English _chook_, _fowl_, and _chicken_ ‘domestic
fowl, _Gallus gallus_’ count as three terms. Second, one can count just the number of
_contrasting taxa_, in the sense of distinct conceptual categories, treating as a single taxon any set of
referential synonyms (i.e. two or more terms that have the same referential meaning). In this
case, for some English speakers the three terms _chicken_, _fowl_ and _chook_ would represent one
taxon. In this study totals generally refer to the number of distinct terms for fish taxa provided
by each source, because it is not always possible to identify synonyms in a list of names.

     Another variable is names for growth stages. For certain species in several groups (e.g.
barracuda, eels, groupers, wrasses, mullet, trevally, sharks) Oceanic languages commonly
distinguish two or more growth stages. In this study I follow the standard practice of treating
each name for a growth stage as representing a distinct taxon.

     Yet another variable is polysemy. Some terms have two senses, one referring to a more
specific category, another to a more general one (e.g. cat can refer to the domestic cat, _Felis felis_,
or more broadly to any member of the cat family (_lion_, _tiger_, _cheetah_, etc.) In this study
generic and specific senses of fish names are not counted separately, chiefly because we lack
reliable data on such sense differences for most languages.


3.2.4 Semantic reconstruction

Hooper (1994:189) points to the kinds of difficulties met in attributing meanings to reconstructed
fish names. The comparative linguist is dependent on the quality of the definitions
available in accounts of contemporary languages and on the measure of agreement between
them. Usually it is possible to pin down the meaning of a reconstructed form to a family or
a group of closely related families, e.g. ‘kind of rock-cod (Serranidae)’ or ‘kind of snapper
(Lutjanidae) or emperor (Lethrinidae)’. In a minority of cases it can be said with considerable
confidence that a name referred to a particular species or group of closely related species, or
to a growth stage of a species or genus.


3.2.5 On formulating hypotheses about whether fish names show similar retention rates to basic vocabulary

Hooper (1994) presents a brief statistical argument that Polynesian uninomial fish names,
overall, show retention rates similar to those exhibited by etyma whose meanings belong
to standard lists of basic vocabulary. She reconstructs 115 PPn fish names for generic and
specific taxa, of which only three are binomials. She notes that if we compare the 112 PPn
uninomials with lists for Uvean (Rensch 1988), Niuatoputapu (Dye 1983) and her own list
for Tokelauan we get impressively high retention rates. The rates are about 66% for Uvean
(74 retentions), 61% for Niuatoputapu (68 retentions) and 84% for Tokelauan (94 retentions).
Hooper adds that ‘[if] we hypothesize that the Proto Polynesians, like their present-day
descendants, used a vocabulary of about 130 monomial [uninominal] fish names, the retention
rates are more plausible: 60% for Uvean, 52.2% for Niuatoputapu, and 72.3% for Tokelauan -
close to the expected average retention rate of 70% for core vocabulary’ (Hooper 1994:187).

    There are certain problems with this proposal. First, Hooper does not say how the
‘expected’ average retention rate of 70%’ for contemporary Polynesian languages was arrived at.
It was presumably based on work in glottochronology indicating that, on average, languages
will replace about 20 percent of words on the 200 item Swadesh list per 1000 years. An estimate
of 30 percent replacement would make sense on the assumption that PPn broke up
around 1400 years ago. This estimate is reasonable as a latest possible date of PPn breakup.

142    Andrew Pawley

    Second, Hooper’s assessment of average retention rates for fish names is based on just
those 112 uninomials that have been reconstructed for PPn. These etyma will be a subset of
the total number of fish names used in PPn (less stable names will not have been recovered).
How small a subset is 112? For reasons indicated in §4, I estimate the number of uninomials
in PPn to be more than 200. To take the case of Uvean, 74 retentions out of 200 would equate
to a retention rate of 37 percent, still substantial but much less than 66 percent. Third, in some
cases semantic matches between PPn fish names and their reflexes are not exact, e.g. the POc
generic term for ‘shark’ is continued in some daughter languages by a term that refers to
the _Remora_ or sucking fish, which attaches itself to sharks. In standard glottochronological
procedure, a form that continues a proto-language etymon but changes the meaning is not
counted as a retention. In the case of PPn fish names that refer to particular families, genera
or species, a reasonable compromise would be to count a reflex as retained in a daughter
language provided that it refers to the same biological family as the etymon in the protolanguage.

    There is, however, a more fundamental concern. Even a comparison of the average retention
rates of PPn fish names with that of basic vocabulary will not leave us much the wiser.
This is because the individual meanings in the basic vocabulary list do not share a constant
retention rate. On the contrary, there is enormous variation in the rates at which forms representing different meanings are replaced. A comparative study of Austronesian languages
(Dyen et al. 1967) indicates that, over a span of several millennia, the least persistent item
on the Swadesh 200 item basic vocabulary list is many times more likely to be replaced than
the most persistent item.

    Using a 196 item meaning list Dyen et al. compared 89 Austronesian languages and calculated
cognation rates over the total set of language pairs. The languages were drawn from
diverse subgroups, most of them belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup, to which 98
percent of Austronesian languages belong. It was found that 10 meanings on the list show
cognation rates of between 50 and 80 percent. Forty-two meanings have rates exceeding 20
percent. Only 70 meanings have rates of more than 10 percent. As many as 105 meanings
show cognation rates of less than seven percent and 43 of these score below three percent.[3]

    Admittedly, cognation rate and retention rate in basic vocabulary are not the same thing.
The former is a measure of how often pairs of languages have cognate words for a given
meaning on the list. The latter is a measure of how often a given reconstructed etymon is
retained with the same meaning. But cognation rate in Dyen et al’s study will generally be
a fairly accurate indicator of retention rate. For example, if a meaning, say ‘louse’, shows a
high cognation rate it is almost certainly represented by an etymon (in this case, _*kutu_) that
was present in a proto-language ancestral to most or all 89 languages in Dyen et al.’s sample
and that has been continued by a high proportion of daughter languages.

[3] Why do basic vocabulary items vary so markedly in cognation rates? Differences in frequency of use in
 discourse may be an important part of the answer but it cannot be the whole answer. Indeed, forms for the ‘verb’
 meaning that is most frequent in spoken discourse in most languages of the world, ‘say’, have a cognation rate
 of less than one percent in the study by Dyen et al., while forms for the less frequent ‘die’ and ‘eat’ score about
 60 percent. The meaning ‘vomit’ (22%) scores higher than ‘come’ (15%) and ‘live’ (9%), although the latter
 cross-linguistically are much more frequent. Why do terms for ‘louse’, with a cognation rate of 71 percent,
 rank in the top five, while ‘man’ (10.5%) and ‘woman’ (13.8%) both fail to make the top 50? Why is ‘blood’
 among the most stable items (27th in rank, cognation rate 27.8%) while ‘water’ is a good deal less stable
 (59th, with 12.3%)? Malcolm Ross (pers. comm.) suggests that where the denotatum of a basic vocabulary
 term is conceptually sharply distinct from other denotata, in a way that is common cross-linguistically, as is the
 case with ‘die’, ‘vomit’ ‘louse’ and ‘blood’, the term will have a high retention rate. But where the denotatum
 belongs to a set of denotata encoded by a set of conceptually overlapping terms, as is the case with ‘say’ (cf
 ‘speak’, ‘talk’, ‘tell’, ‘inform’ etc.), the retention rate will be low.

                                            Stability and change in Oceanic fish names     143

     Retention rates for what are approximately the most stable 60 items of POc basic vocabulary
in a modified Swadesh list were presented in Pawley (2009). Retentions and replacements were
recorded in a sample of 40 present-day Oceanic languages. Retention rates for
individual items ranged between 97 and 23 percent. Each of the 24 most persistent POc etyma
were retained by 70 percent or more languages, 44 etyma were retained by 50 percent
or more languages, 54 by 40 percent or more, and 60 by 23 percent or more.

     Given that individual basic vocabulary items vary so much in their retention rates, there
is little point in asking whether POc fish names in general show retention rates similar to
basic vocabulary in general. We need to ask questions sensitive to the variable retention rates
of individual lexical items. First, retention rates needed to be determined for a sample of
POc fish names Then it will become possible to make comparisons with the rates established
for the 60 most POc etyma in the modified Swadesh basic vocabulary list. We can ask, for
instance, how many fish names have a higher retention rate than the 20th, or 40th, or 60th
most stable etymon in the basic vocabulary list.


3.3 Retention rates for POc fish names

3.3.1 Investigating retention rates for a sample of POc fish names

Retention rates for 52 POc fish names, drawn from Osmond’s list of reconstructions, were
investigated in 12 languages belonging to diverse subgroups: Titan (Admiralties group),
Mutu (North New Guinea), Motu (Papuan Tip), Marovo and Teop (Meso-Melanesian), Gela
(Guadalcanal-Gelic), Arosi and Lau (Makira-Malaitan), Kiribati and Satawalese (Micronesian),
Wayan (Fijian) and Niuatoputapu (a dialect of Tongan, Polynesian).

    Between them, the 52 POc names represent a wide range of fish families. In Osmond’s
data each of the 140 secure reconstructions is well attested by cognate sets drawn from diverse
subgroups. In my sample not all reconstructions are well attested: whereas Osmond was in
some cases able to draw on cognates from scores of languages, my sample consists of just 12.

    For convenience of presentation the 52 POc names are divided into four groups. Tables
 3.2-3.5 show the presence (y) or absence (-) of reflexes of each etymon in the 12 contemporary
 languages. A question mark, accompanied by an explanatory footnote, indicates doubt
as to whether the form should be counted as a reflex of the etymon. The columns showing
the number of retentions (‘no. retentions’) and the percentage of languages that reflect the
etymon then show alternate figures, one not counting, the other counting the doubtful reflex.

3.3.2 Some fish names are as persistent as some basic vocabulary items

We are now in a position to evaluate the hypothesis that some Proto Oceanic fish names have
been as persistent as some basic vocabulary items.

    It was noted in §2.5 that, in a sample of 40 daughter languages, the 60 most conservative
POc basic vocabulary items in a modified 200 item Swadesh list show retention rates ranging
between 97 and 23 percent. The 24 most persistent etyma were retained by 70 percent or more
languages, 44 etyma were retained by 50 percent or more languages, 54 by 40 percent or more,
and 60 by 23 percent or more.

    No fewer than 38 of the 52 POc fish names examined show retention rates within the
range exhibited by the 60 most stable basic vocabulary etyma. Eleven fish names fall within
the range of the 44 most stable basic vocabulary etyma. The hypothesis is strongly supported.

    Some small caveats must be attached to this conclusion. Methodological difficulties in
comparing fish name retentions with basic vocabulary retentions were discussed in §2. In
this study the fish name retention rates are based on just 12 languages, whereas the basic
vocabulary retention rates are based on 40. (The same 40 languages could not be used in the
fish names study for reasons stated in §2.1.) If the composition of the two samples, in terms
of distribution across major subgroups, were markedly different this might bias the results,
because some Oceanic subgroups are known to contain more languages that are lexically
conservative than other subgroups. However, the composition is roughly similar so the effects
of different sample sizes are probably small.

    Only two fish names have retention rates of more than 70 percent, ranking with the most
stable 24 basic vocabulary items. One of these is the life form taxon _*ikan_ ‘fish’. The other is
the generic _*(ñ,n)opuq_ ‘stonefish’. These repulsive-looking fish are not economically useful
but are extremely dangerous denizens of the shallow sandy bottoms. The next three most stable forms consist of the respective generics for sharks and rays, _*bakewa_ and _*paRi_, together
with _*qatun_, which denotes one or more species of much-prized game fish in the bonito and
tuna family. Sharks and rays are extremely salient fish for several reasons: they are highly
distinctive in appearance and behaviour, very large, some kinds are dangerous, and they have
economic importance. The next five names in the top ten all denote large or fairly large fish
that are highly regarded as food.


3.3.3 Retention rates of names by families or higher-order groups

Have names for taxa belonging to certain families of fish been more persistent than names for
taxa belonging to other families? An answer to this question requires comparison of all secure
POc reconstructions with a later language or languages. One set of comparisons that can
readily be made is between POc, PCP and PPn. Table 3.7 specifies the number of retentions
in PCP and PPn of reconstructed POc names for fish belonging to particular families or, in
the case of sharks, rays and eels, high-order groups.

    Unfortunately, numbers in most groups are too low to make tests of statistical significance
useful. Among those groups with four or more POc names it is noteworthy that carangids,
scombrids, rock cod and mullet, all important food fish, show high retention rates in both
PCP and PPn. But it is unclear why, of the four names in the sample representing carangids,
one, _*laci_ ‘_Scomberoides_ spp. incl. _Scomberoides lysan_’, has been very durable (scoring 58%) while the
other three have not (_*qatule_, probably denoting the big-eyed scad, _*qulua_ and _*pilu_, both
denoting _Caranx_ sp. or spp., all score 25% or less). It is also striking that although most POc
names for kinds of eels and for Acanthuridae (surgeonfish and unicomfish) are retained in
PCP, very few are kept in PPn.


3.3.4 Variation in retention rate among languages in the sample

The 12 languages vary greatly in their retention rates for fish names (Table 3.8). This finding
is consistent with what is known about retention rates for basic vocabulary among Austronesian languages in general (Blust 1981b, 1999b).

    The percentages for certain languages are likely to have been deflated by the
incompleteness of the fish name lists for these languages, particularly Kiribati and Mutu and to a lesser
extent Arosi, Lau, Niuatoputapu and Teop.

3.4 Estimating the size of the Proto Oceanic lexicon of fish names

3.4.1 Introduction

Let us turn now to another set of questions. How many fish taxa were distinguished in POc?
What proportion of the fish names were uninomials and binomials, respectively?

     A fair idea can be gained by looking carefully at descriptions of a sample of present day
languages. Investigators making fairly comprehensive studies of particular fishing communities living in rich marine environments in western Melanesia have consistently recorded
more than 300 names for kinds of fish. Hviding (1996:193) says that speakers of Marovo
distinguish by name over 400 kinds of fish; Hviding (1990) lists 316 Marovo fish names. For
Gela, Foale (1998) lists 368 names (including 14 synonyms). During only 12-16 weeks fieldwork on M’bunai Titan, a language of the Admiralty Islands, Akimichi & Sakiyama (1991)
recorded 287 fish taxa.

     Figures for some communities in Remote Oceania are of a similar order. Helfman and
Randall (1973) give 336 fish names for Palauan, a non-Oceanic Austronesian language.
For Satawalese, spoken on an atoll in the Central Carolines, 400 names were recorded by
Akimichi & Sauchomal (1982), based on seven months fieldwork. This number is high considering that Satawalese is a part of a chain of atolls, and the range of species and genera is
likely to be fewer than in the vicinity of large high islands and especially, continental Melanesia. For the Western Fijian language of Wayan, 484 fish names were recorded of which 352
are uninomials and 132 are binomials (Pawley and Sayaba 2003). (This count excludes about
60 binomials that are probably descriptions rather than conventional names.)

     Total counts for some isolated atolls and small high islands in the central Pacific are a
bit lower. Lieber (1994) gives 262 names for Kapingamarangi, an isolated atoll south of the
main Carolines group. Rensch (1983) gives 284 names for Uvean (aka Wallisian), in western
Polynesia, and Lavondes (1977) gives 260 fish names for Marquesan. There are a number of
other published lists which, although very useful, are plainly incomplete. For example, the
list (Dye 1983) for Niuatoputapu, a language of western Polynesia, consists of 209 names
(37 of these mark developmental stages of 12 species).

     For Tobelo, a non-Austronesian language of the Bird’s Head family in North Halmahera,
Taylor (1990) recorded 358 fish taxa. For Pendau, a Malayo-Polynesian language of central
Sulawesi, Quick (2010) recorded 300 names, of which 73% were uninomials.

     For reasons to be discussed below, it is likely that none of the inventories of fish names
referred to above is exhaustive, not even those numbering over 400. There are various means
of spotting the gaps and estimating their extent. We turn now to this matter.

3.4.2 Estimating absolute numbers of names

One method of detecting gaps is simply to compare the total number of fish names recorded
for each language in a representative sample. It can be seen that, among the 12 languages
cited in Table 3.9, the total number of names varies greatly.[27]

    Insofar as all these languages are spoken by fishing communities who use similar fishing
techniques and have access to a pretty similar range of fish families and genera, and indeed
species, we would expect the size of their lexicons to be more similar than they are. On these
grounds alone it can be inferred that the lists numbering below 300 are probably incomplete,
especially for the languages of Melanesia, and lists below 200 are seriously incomplete.
However, it must be allowed that in some Pacific Island communities there has in recent times
been a reduction in the range of fishing methods employed and a decline in knowledge of
fish names and fish ecology.


3.4.3 Number and ratio of uninomials to binomials

Another method is to compare the ratio of uninomials and binomials that have been recorded,
as well as the absolute numbers of each (Table 3.10).

    Taking the five languages with the highest number of uninomials in Table 3.10 as
representing the best described languages, we find an average of 271 uninomials. It is noteworthy
that the three Polynesian languages in the sample range between 138 and 180 uninomials,
well short of this figure.

    In the best documented Oceanic fish taxonomies, binomials normally amount to between
 27 and 38 percent of the total names (median 30 percent). If the proportion of binomials
recorded for a language deviates markedly from this range it stands out as suspiciously
anomalous. In three languages, Titan, Kiribati and Teop, the percentage of binomials is 15
percent or less. It is likely that in each case the list of binomials is seriously incomplete. Most
striking is Titan, where binomials make up only three percent of the 287 fish names. We can
infer that roughly 100 Titan binomials were not recorded. At the other extreme, Kapingama-
rangi (43%) is considerably above the median; it may be that in this case the list of binomials
includes some ad hoc descriptive forms and/or that the list of uninomials is far from complete.

[27] In this and later tables ‘K’marangi’ refers to Kapingamarangi and ‘Niua’ to Niuatoputapu.

3.4.4 Comparison of number of fish names family by family

Yet another indicator of how complete the record of fish names for a particular language is,
comes from cross-linguistic comparison of the number of taxa or names for each particular
biological family (or sometimes a group of related families). Fairly consistent patterns emerge
as to how many taxa are typically distinguished in each family or larger group. If the number
of recorded taxa in a language is much lower than the average or median this is a sign that
the list is incomplete.

    Tables 3.11-3.22 give the number of names recorded for certain groups of fishes in eight
contemporary languages plus PPn. The groups are usually a single family or a pair of closely
related families, though in the case of sharks, rays and eels, each group consists of several
families. In the case of PPn, it is to be expected that the totals for each family will generally
be below the average for contemporary languages because the PPn reconstructions consist
almost exclusively of uninomials and because the PPn list is probably more seriously incomplete
than that of any of the contemporary languages.

    The __Serranidae__ and __Carangidae__ (Table 3.11) both contain many species and many important
food fish. Morphologically distinct species in each family are consistently classified
into many taxa. (There seem to be no cases where a language has a generic for the diverse
Serranidae family and the same is true for the Carangidae. Generics exist with much more
restricted ranges.) For the Serranidae, the Teop list is anomalous in having only seven names.
Of the 26 Gela terms for Serranidae, as many as eight are synonyms, so the number of distinct
taxa is only 18. For the Carangidae, Niuatoputapu and Wayan are anomalous in having
as few as six and 10 names, respectively, and Gela in having as many as 43. The Gela list
includes four terms for growth stages (other than the unmarked, mature stage term) and five
synonyms.

    With hundreds of species each, the __Labridae__ and __Scaridae__ (Table 3.12) are two of the
largest and morphologically most diverse families. Both families contain many important
food fish. Kiribati and Niuatoputapu are anomalous in distinguishing only three and four
terms for Labridae. Wayan stands out in distinguishing as many as 48. Twenty-seven of the
Wayan terms are uninomials, so even if we discount some binomials as being merely descriptive
the number of valid taxa remains high.

    __Mullidae__, goatfish (aka grey mullet, Table 3.13) are a fairly numerous family of shallow
water feeders, usually caught in nets or traps, and which are easily identified by the pair
of barbels on the chin. There is usually a generic term for the family as well as a number
of named kinds. __Mugilidae__, mullet (aka red mullet), are a small family of shallow water
feeders, with just a few species present in any one locality, but are economically important
and each species is often distinctively named. The Gela, Wayan and Teop lists are anomalous
in distinguishing only two or three Mugilidae taxa.

    The __scombrids__ (Table 3.14) include several species much valued as game fish and usually
finely discriminated in indigenous Oceanic taxonomies. However, the family is morphologically fairly diverse and it is not usual to find a generic for the whole family. Wayan is on the
low side in number of scombrid taxa. __Xiphiidae__ are a very small family of morphologically
distinctive deep sea fish. The lists for Niuatoputapu and Gela lack names for two prominent
kinds of Xiphiidae: swordfish and marlins, and Teop, unusually, subsumes all kinds in one
taxon.

    The __Acanthuridae__ (Table 3.15) are a moderately us family of reef grazers which
occur in schools. The larger species, especially, are valued as food and morphologically distinctive species are usually named separately. Satawalese has an exceptionally high number
of Acanthuridae names, as many as 28 being uninomials. The __Siganidae__ are a fairly small
family of reef grazers with very sharp fin spines. They are good eating and are usually finely
discriminated in the taxonomy. The Satawalese, Niuatoputapu, Uvean and Kiribati lists appear to be missing some terms.

    The __Holocentridae__ (Table 3.16) are small, brilliant shallow water coral fishes. There is
often a generic for the family and invariably several taxa are named. The __Balistidae__, grazing fish of the coral reef and weedy shallows, number many species. Most are distinctively
marked with bright colours and many are separately named. Some are poisonous. The __Aluteridae__ comprise many species of small or medium sized grazing fish, similar in habits to
the Balistidae. Some species are considered poisonous. Aluteridae and Balistidae are sometimes subsumed under a single generic in Oceanic languages. There is a marked gap between
Satawalese and Wayan and the rest in number of names for Holocentridae and for Balistidae
and Aluteridae.

     The __Lutjanidae__ (snappers, Table 3.17) are a large family of carnivorous fish, mostly
bottom dwellers moving in schools in outer coral reefs and lagoons. The __Lethrinidae__ (emperors)
comprise about 20 species living mainly in shallow, coastal waters. Noteworthy here
is the high number of terms for kinds of snapper in Gela, and the low numbers for Wayan,
and also the high number of Titan terms for emperors. The fact that authors providing lists
of fish names and identifications for Oceanic languages often follow conflicting scientific
taxonomies creates difficulties in comparing group totals across languages. Taxonomists disagree,
for example, over whether __Lethrinidae__ and __Plectorhinchinae__ (grunters, sweetlips)
should be assigned to the family __Lutjanidae__ or to separate families. Members of these closely
related groups are carnivorous, usually have large heads, equal jaws and a forked tail-fin.
They are an important food source and many taxa are distinguished but as a rule, Oceanic
languages have no generic terms for any of the families (or sub-families) in question.

     __Sharks__ and __rays__ (Table 3.18) each fall into several families, some with several species.
Individual species tend to be salient because of their size and distinctive morphology and
behaviour and, in some cases, because they are eaten. In Oceanic languages there is almost
always a generic term for sharks and another for rays, and the generics generally have several
subtaxa. The Kiribati, Niuatoputapu, Titan and Teop totals for sharks are on the low side, as
is the Gela total for rays.

     __Eels__ (Table 3.19) fall into several families, chiefly the Anguillidae (freshwater eels) and
several families of sea or brackish water eels: Muraenidae (morays), Ophichthydae (snake
eels), Congridae (conger eels) and Muraenesocidae (pike eels or pike congers). This highly
salient group of fish is usually finely classified in Oceanic languages. There is often a generic
term for eels as well as terms (often with subtaxa) for each of the families.

     __Sphyraenidae__ (barracuda, Table 3.19) are a small family of predatory fish, large fast
and elongated, with very large sharp teeth that make them dangerous to humans. They are
good eating. Generally, several growth stages and sometimes two or three mature kinds of
barracuda are distinguished. It can be seen that several languages are on the low side in
number of recorded eel and barracuda taxa.

     The __Clupeidae__ (Table 3.20) are small migratory shoaling fish of shallow coastal waters.
They are good eating and are taken in nets. The lists for Gela, Niuatoputapu, Satawalese and
Teop score notably lower than Titan and Wayan in number of Clupeidae, and it is likely that
the lists are incomplete. The only member of the __Chanidae__ is the milkfish, _Chanos chanos_,
which is everywhere distinguished. The __Atherinidae__ are a small family of silvery, sardinelike
schooling fishes which are mainly used as bait.

     The genus Synanceia (stonefish) is sometimes included by ichthyologists in the family
__Scorpaenidae__ (scorpionfish) and the two groups are lumped together here (Table 3.21).
Species of this morphologically diverse family all have long poisonous pectoral and dorsal
spines. The Synanceia have the most potent of all the fish venoms, secreted from glands at
the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines. They have large grotesquely shaped heads and
mouths and conceal themselves by lying in mud, sand, coral or weeds, and are extremely
dangerous. Wayan distinguishes many more scorpionfish and stonefish taxa than the other
languages. The fact that most Wayan names are uninomials suggests that lists for some of the
other languages are incomplete.

    The __Blennidae__ (blennies, Table 3.22) are a large family of agile, small elongated fish of

amphibious species of mangrove swamps and muddy shores. Figures for these three families
are lumped together here both because lexicographical identifications are often vague, and
because ichthyologists have trouble deciding how many families should be distinguished.
The totals for Satawalese and Gela are spectacularly higher than the rest. Most Gela terms
are binomials and it is possible that some represent ad hoc descriptive epithets rather than
conventional names.

    This survey of family name totals suggests that even the larger inventories of fish names
for Oceanic languages, those in the 350-480 range, are not complete. The Wayan list, for
example, shows significantly below average numbers of names for Carangidae, Lutjanidae,
Mugilidae and Scombridae.

    POc speakers lived in the Bismarck Archipelago, a region with a very rich fish fauna.
Lexical evidence (Osmond 1998) and archaeological evidence (Walter 1989, Kirch 1997)
indicate that they exploited a wide range of fishing techniques. Given these considerations,
we can infer that the number of fish taxa distinguished by POc speakers was on the same order
as the largest numbers recorded for contemporary Oceanic languages, in the 400+ range, and
that about 70 percent of fish names were uninomials.


3.5 Where have all the fish names gone?

The total number of fish names so far reconstructed for POc (145) falls far short of the number that we estimate were used by speakers of the language. Why are so many names missing
from the reconstructed inventory? A similar question can be asked about PCP (150-160 reconstructions) and PPn (115).

     One category of missing names can easily be identified: binomials. The only secure binomial
reconstructed for POc is _*paRi manuk_ ‘eagle ray, _Aetobatus narinari_ (lit. ‘bird ray’).
  (_*saku-layaR_ ‘swordfish’ is historically analysable into _*saku_ ‘needlefish and long toms’
plus _*layaR_ ‘sail’, but it was not a binomial: it is clear from contemporary evidence that
_*saku-layaR_ were not a kind of _*saku_) Of the 160 reconstructions in Geraghty’s (1994) list
of PCP fish names, just two are binomials. Of the 115 fish names that Hooper (1994) reconstructs for
PPn, just three are binomials. The lack of widespread fully cognate binomial terms
confirms what many commentators (e.g. Rensch 1983) have said: binomials, or to be more
exact, the secondary or modifying terms in binomials, are notoriously unstable. Binomials
generally make up around 30 percent of the total taxa in Oceanic fish taxonomies (see §3).
The chances are that most of this 30 percent of missing POc terms will never be recoverable.

     The dramatic difference between uninomial and binomial retention rates, presumably, has
something to do with the geographic distribution of species as opposed to genera. Folk generics,
represented by uninomials, are typically applied to two or more species of a biological
genus and are sometimes applied to whole families. The same genera and families of fish tend
to occur throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific. By contrast, folk specifics, often represented by
binomials, typically apply to a single biological species or a group of closely related species
and the geographic distribution of species tends to be more localised. Thus, modifying terms
for folk specifics do not ‘travel’ as well as generic terms. But perhaps the main reason is
that while generic names are usually arbitrary, modifiers almost always describe a feature of
the morphology, the behaviour or the ecological niche of particular species. Accordingly, a
number of competing modifiers may suggest themselves as equally convenient ways of
distinguishing a particular member of a folk genus, so that even when a species is ubiquitous
the original modifier in a binomial will often be subject to competition.

     So much for the binomials. This still leaves many missing uninomials unaccounted for.
One might seek to explain variations in durability among uninomials in terms of (a) where
names rank in the taxonomic hierarchy, (b) the relation of particular taxa to humans, e.g.
their usefulness, importance in cosmology and ritual, or danger, (c) inherent properties of
the referents, e.g. how striking or unusual they are in appearance or behaviour, and (d) the
geographic distribution of particular species and genera.

160   Andrew Pawley

     While factor (d) very likely has had a considerable influence on the durability of binomials
I do not think it has played much of a part with respect to uninomials. The latter generally
refer to genera, families or high-order groups, and in those cases where they refer just to a
 single species it usually is one that is highly distinctive and widespread in the tropical Pacific.
This is the case for the few POc reconstructions that can be identified as referring, or probably
referring to a single species, e.g. _*qawaq_ ‘milkfish, _Chanos chanos_’, _*qume_ ‘unicornfish,
_Naso unicornis_’, _*mamin_ ‘double-headed Maori wrasse, _Cheilinus undulatus_’ and possibly _*qalun_
 ‘skipjack tuna, _Katsuwonus pelamis_’.

     A reasonable hypothesis is that, other things being equal, the persistence of a name will
correlate with its rank in the taxonomy: names of life-form taxa will be the most persistent,
followed by major generics, minor generics, and specifics, in that order. There is some
evidence in support of this hypothesis although what we can say is limited by the lack of
precise semantic reconstructions for many POc names. The life form _*ikan_ ‘fish’ and the
major generics _*bakewa_ ‘shark’, _*paRi_ ‘ray’ and _*kanase_ ‘mullet’ show high retention rates.
However, the generics _*bebek_ ‘butterflyfish and coralfish’, _*jumu_ ‘triggerfish and leatherjackets’,
_*saku_ ‘needlefish and long toms’ and _*tuna_ ‘freshwater eel’ all score quite low. In
general minor generics have relatively low retention rates but the single most durable fish
name, _*(n,ri)opuq_ ‘stonefish’, was probably a minor generic, memorable because the stone
fish is so dangerous.

     I have not carefully scrutinised evidence bearing on the hypothesis that, at the level of
folk generics and folk specifics, names for economically valuable fish will be more stable
than other names (all other things being equal). There is some evidence that this is the case.
For example, names for various members of the highly valued scombrid, carangid, rock-cod,
snapper and mullet families tend to show high retention rates.

     Further research should shed more light on these matters.



4 Aquatic invertebrates


4.1 Introduction

This chapter deals with invertebrates that are aquatic or semi-aquatic, such as crustaceans,
molluscs, echinoderms, sea-worms, jellyfish and corals.[1] It addresses the following questions:
(1) What terms for aquatic invertebrates can be attributed to Proto Oceanic (POc) and
other high-order interstages of Oceanic? (2) What uses were made of these animals? (3) How
does the number of taxa reconstructable for POc compare with the number attested in well-described
contemporary languages?

    The marine invertebrate fauna of the tropical southwest and central Pacific is fairly
uniform, so that when Oceanic speakers first dispersed across this region some 3000 years ago
they generally encountered familiar creatures. It must be added that not every island or island
group has the full range of habitats: fringing coral reefs, mangrove forests, estuarine
mudflats, seagrass flats, etc.

    Molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms gathered in and around the intertidal zone form
one of the most reliable protein food sources of coastal Oceanic communities. The bulk of
foraging for invertebrates in this zone is done by women while in most societies diving for
lobsters and deep water molluscs is mainly men’s work. Mollusc shells were traditionally
made into a variety of tools and ornaments. Archaeological discoveries underline the longstanding
importance of water invertebrates to speakers of Oceanic languages. Living sites
and middens left by bearers of the Lapita culture contain extensive remains of molluscs and
crustaceans and artefacts made from mollusc shells (see §4.1).

[1] This is a much revised and expanded version of Pawley (1996). I am grateful to Meredith Osmond for help
 in compiling and checking the list of cognate sets, and to Ann Chowning. John Lynch and Malcolm Ross
 for valuable comments on a draft of the paper. I am also indebted to Ann Chowning for data on some New
 Britain languages, to Paul Geraghty for providing terms from the Viwa dialect of Wayan Fijian and for helpful
 discussion of the Wayan material and to John Lynch for comparative material on Southern Vanuatu languages.

   Linguistic evidence that foraging on the reef for invertebrates was important to Proto
Oceanic speakers is found in two widespread cognate sets noted by Clark (1991). Clark’s
POc reconstructions are given below, with a few additional cognates.[2] The first is a verb.

<

  Fij:  Rotuman       haŋota      (v) ‘to fish.’; (N) ‘fishing excursion, shoal of fish’
  Pn:   Tongan        fāŋota      ‘to fish, or to search for shell-fish or any kind of _fiŋota_’
  Pn:   Niuean        faŋota      ‘gather shellfish on the reef’

  Pn:   Ifira-Mele    fāŋota      ‘gather shellfish etc. on the reef’
>

    The second reconstruction, _*p<in>aŋoda_, is a nominalisation of the verb using the infix
_*<in>_, which in POc typically derived a noun denoting the thing acted on or produced by
the action of the verb. It is likely that _*piŋoda_ was present in POc as a fast speech variant:
reflexes of _*p<in>aŋoda_ show loss of the second syllable in all Polynesian languages and in
some North and Central Vanuatu and Papuan Tip languages.

  PT:  Kilivila      vigoda      ‘shell (clams, snails)’
  PT:  Dobu          igoda       (v) ‘gather shellfish’; (N) ‘shellfish’
  MM:  Tolai         vinaŋonoi   ‘generic name for sea shells’ (final syllable irregular)

[2] In these two reconstructions I have substituted _*d_ for the POc phoneme that Clark writes as _*nt_.

[3] With respect to ‘shellfish’, much used in dictionary' and wordlist glosses cited for this and certain other cognate
 sets, it should be noted that this term means different things to different people. Nearly all New Zealanders and
 many Australians and English people use ‘shellfish’ to mean ‘(edible) molluscs with external shells’, excluding
 crustaceans, whereas others, including most people from the USA, use it to mean ‘(edible) crustaceans and
 molluscs with external shells’. It is apparent that most of our sources for Oceanic languages use
 this term in the narrower sense.

4.2 Classification of marine invertebrates

4.2.1 Zoological classification

In the discussion that follows cognate sets presented will be grouped under standard zoological
categories. Zoology offers a complex phylogenetic taxonomy of invertebrates based
on current views of their evolutionary relationships and morphological characters. The
invertebrate family tree distinguishes more than 20 levels of grouping from kingdom down to
species. Here we need only note those distinctions which will be useful in organising the
material from Oceanic languages.

4.2.2 Oceanic folk taxonomies of aquatic invertebrates

In order to get an idea of the likely size and taxonomic structure of the POc lexicon for
aquatic invertebrates one must look at contemporary languages whose speakers exploit a
marine and shore environment fairly similar to that inhabited by POc speakers. Unfortunately
there are very few systematic studies in this domain. There is a fairly detailed account of
aquatic invertebrate taxonomy in Wayan, a dialect of the Western Fijian language (Pawley 1994,
Pawley and Sayaba 2003) spoken on two small islands on the western margin of Fiji.
Wayan speakers distinguish by name more than 240 marine invertebrate taxa.[4] Almost 150
of these names apply to molluscs, about 48 to crustaceans, about 31 to echinoderms, about 12
to coelenterates and about five to marine worms.

    Folk classifications of animals have many fewer levels than those recognised by zoologists.
Berlin (1992) has discussed at length the organising principles underlying folk taxonomies of
animals and plants (see chapter 8 for more detail). As folk taxonomies go, the
Wayan classification of aquatic animals is among the more complex. Some domains have a
depth of six contrasting levels - two levels more than Berlin’s model recognises as the known
maximum for folk taxonomies of wild animals.

    Table 4.1 shows the contrasts between some first-order categories of invertebrates that
occur in the Wayan Fijian taxonomy. These fall under no higher category other than _manumanu_,
which refers to all creatures.

    In many respects Wayan higher-order taxa differ markedly from those found in zoological
classifications. For instance, there is no echinoderm category: sea cucumbers, sea urchins,
starfish and brittle starfish are each assigned to separate primary taxa. There is no category
corresponding to crustaceans. There is a general name for sea cucumbers but no overt taxon
uniting the various sea urchin taxa (these animals represent a covert category, which Wayans
readily identify by a descriptive phrase such as _manumanu laulau ni ðakau_ ‘spiky animals
of the reef’). Unsurprisingly, octopus and squid form a primary taxon apart from other molluscs.
There is a generic for gastropods (_ðiði_) but no generic for all bivalves. Instead there
are generics for burrowing bivalves (_tavē_) and all kinds of oysters (_ðiva_). Wayan also has a
category, _manumanu gwāgwā_, that refers to edible decapods, subsuming _ura_, _seka_, _tubā_, _uŋa_
and _tolā_. However, this is a ‘collective’ category rather than a true superordinate taxon: one
does not point to an animal and identify it as a _manumanu gwāgwā_.

[4] These numbers refer to terminal taxa, i.e. excluding higher-order taxa (generic terms with two or more subtaxa),
 and counting only one item for each set of synonyms or variant forms. Numbers are necessarily approximate
because of disagreements among informants, the uncertain status of some descriptive binomials, and other
 factors.

         | _lase_             | hard corals
         | _sam_              | jellyfish

    Systematic descriptions of other Oceanic taxonomies are admittedly few but the available
evidence suggests that the size and taxonomic structure of the Wayan terminology are fairly
typical of Oceanic-speaking maritime communities.[5] It is reasonable to assume that the POc
taxonomy was roughly of the same order.

[5] For information about taxonomies of aquatic invertebrates in particular Oceanic languages see
Akimichi & Sakiyama (1991). Foale (1998), Hviding (2005). Pawley (1994).


4.3 Crustaceans

From the limited evidence available it seems that Oceanic languages spoken by coastal communities
typically distinguish some 40-50 crustacean taxa, of which between 20 and 40 taxa
are crabs.


4.3.1 Order _Decapoda_: crabs, lobsters, prawns

The crustaceans named and taken for food and bait in Oceanic societies are almost exclusively
decapods. There is a well established PMP generic for prawns and crayfish, which is
continued in POc.

4.3.2 Palinura: spiny lobsters

The Palinura are represented in Oceania by two major families: (1) Palinuridae, spiny or
rock lobsters and (2) Scyllaridae, slipper or shovel-nosed lobsters. (The terms ‘lobster’ and
‘crayfish’ are used interchangeably by many English speakers and the gloss ‘crayfish’ is
commonly found in the dictionaries and wordlists.)

Figure 4.1:    _Palinurus_ sp., spiny lobster

                                                                            Aquatic invertebrates      167


4.3.2.1 Palinuridae, spiny lobsters

Lobsters are prized food in the Oceanic world. Among the spiny lobsters the commonest
species is _Palinurus pencillatus_, the common spiny lobster. _P. versicolor_ is a larger, more
colourful relative. These are distinguished as specifics in Wayan.

   In contemporary languages reflexes of the POc generic _*quraŋ_ (see §3.1) are typically
applied to spiny lobsters (_Palinurus_ spp.) as opposed to the very distinctive slipper lobsters
(Scyllaridae). It is likely that this was also the case in POc.


4.3.2.2 Scyllaridae, slipper (or shovel-nosed) lobsters

Slipper lobsters are a family of clawless decapods with a very distinctive appearance, having
a broad flat carapace and enlarged antennae projecting forward from the head as wide plates.
Species of this family are found in warm waters throughout Oceania. A term for slipper lobster
can be tentatively reconstructed for POc but the comparisons are phonologically problematic.

    There is a well attested term in PCP which shows some resemblance to the above. However,
the correspondence of PPn _*t_ to Fijian _ð_ indicates a PCP palatal (which Blust (1978b)
writes _*c_ and Geraghty 1986 as _*j_).

   Another set of resemblant forms, represented in certain MM languages of New Georgia
and Santa Isabel and in one SES language, shows a superficial resemblance to the Central
Pacific forms but the sound correspondences do not match and point instead to an earlier
form such as _*pepete_ or _*tepe-tepe_).

4.3.3 Suborder Natantia: true prawns and shrimps

In many Oceanic languages reflexes of _*guraŋ_ serve as the general name for prawns and
shrimps and this was evidently the case in POc. However, a second term, _*luRa_, has reflexes
in certain Micronesian and Fijian languages.

4.3.4 Suborder Anomura: hermit crabs, mud lobsters, half-crabs

The Anomura, which include hermit and coconut crabs, are not true crabs but form a suborder
that is sister to true crabs (Brachyura). They have a long abdomen and appear to have
only three pairs of walking legs, the last pair usually being hidden inside the gill chamber
under the carapace. The Anomura are an extremely varied group and no Oceanic language
has a name for the group as a whole.

4.3.4.1 Paguroidea: Coenobitidae (hermit and coconut crabs), and Diogenidae and Paguridae (sea-dwelling hermit crabs)

This group includes the familiar hermit crabs which carry a gastropod shell to protect their
long soft abdomen. The coenobitids are terrestrial hermit crabs which have the left claw larger
than or equal to the right. The coenobitids include the large coconut crab (or robber crab). The
pagurids have a larger right claw. The sea-dwelling hermit crabs of the families Diogenidae
and Paguridae are considerably larger than land-dwelling hermit crabs, growing up to 7 to 10
cm in length.

4.3.4.2 _Birgus latro_, coconut crab

Figure 4.2:     _Birgus latro_, coconut crab

There is a strongly supported reconstruction for the coconut crab, _Birgus latro_, which climbs
coconut trees to sever coconuts and is widely believed by Oceanic comunities to be able to
open coconuts. This very large crab is considered a delicacy and has been hunted to extinction
on some smaller islands.

4.3.4.3 Hermit crabs

A number of Oceanic languages distinguish several kinds of hermit crabs by name. The
distinguishing criteria include size, habitat (sea vs land) and growth stage. For example, for
Niuean Sperlich (1997) records four taxa of hermit crab: _āo_ ‘hermit crab, _Dardanus_ sp.’,
_pulou_ ‘a hermit crab’, _uŋa-mea_ ‘a land dwelling hermit crab’ and _uŋa-uŋa_ ‘a sea dwelling
hermit crab’. Hermit crabs are widely used as bait.

    Three uninominal terms for hermit crabs are attributable to POc: _*qumʷaŋ_, _*koba_ and
_*kato(q)u_. It is unlikely that these terms were full synonyms. Unfortunately, the glosses
provided for the reflexes in our sources are typically general and do not allow a semantic
distinction to be made between the three POc terms.

    _*qumʷaŋ_ continues a PAn etymon. In Oceanic languages a reflex of this form commonly
stands as a generic for typical hermit crabs, in contrast to coconut crabs. However, in several
Oceanic languages reflexes have an extended sense that includes coconut crabs.

4.3.4.4 Other Anomura: Thalassina, mud lobsters, and Porcellanidae, porcelain crabs (half-crabs)

There are only two species of _Thalassina_, the distinctive ‘mud lobster’ of the Indo-Pacific
region, a nocturnal animal that digs a deep and intricate network of burrows in mangrove
mudflats. It typically grows up to 16-20 cm long. _Thalassina_ are found as far east as Fiji and
Samoa. The meat is bland and this animal is not a prized source of food but it is trapped for
its edible claws in parts of Fiji. In the few dictionaries that provide names for the mud lobster
each language has its own generic, e.g. Gedaged _gumei_, Nduke _zona_, Roviana _zoa_, Bauan
Fijian _manā_, Western Fijian _tolā_, No POc reconstruction is possible.

     Porcelain crabs (or half-crabs) are small, usually 1-2 cm wide. They are common on
rocky beaches and shorelines. Names for porcelain crabs are seldom given in Oceanic dictionaries
and no widespread cognate set has been found.


4.3.5 Brachyura: true crabs

True crabs are the dominant decapods on marine coasts. In true crabs (tribe Brachyura) the
front pair of legs are clawed and the abdomen is reduced, flattened and folded underneath
the carapace. Eggs are attached to the pleopods of the female’s abdomen. Of the many crab
species only a minority are of economic value to Oceanic communities.

    Oceanic speaking communities exploiting reefs and mangrove swamps typically distinguish
between 20 and 30 crab taxa, excluding crabs of the tribe Anomura. For example, dictionaries
of Arosi, Wayan Fijian and Niuean, list about 30, 33 and 22 taxa, respectively, excluding the
Anomura. There is little doubt that POc would have had a similar array. However,
only seven secure POc terms for Brachyura crabs have been reconstructed: _*kape_, _*kaRaka_,
_*kaRu(i)ki_, _*kuka_, _*rakum(u)_, _*qalimaŋo_, _*tubaRa_.

4.3.5.1 Portunidae, mangrove and swimming crabs

Oceania has many species of portunids, belonging to the genera _Portunus_, _Thalamita_ and
_Charybdis_. Most are large crabs, much valued as food. The English folk names ‘mud crab’,
‘mangrove crab’ or ‘black crab’ are often applied to _Scylla serrata_, a large round crab which
may exceed 20 cm in width and which burrows in muddy shallow tidal waters of estuaries and
mangrove swamps. POc continues a PMP term, _*qalimaŋaw_, that probably denoted several
portunids of the genus _Scylla_. Wolff’s dictionary of Cebuano describes _alimaŋu_ as ‘edible
crab of tidal swamps, round in shape, up to 10 inches in diameter, black on back, white front,
large meaty claws’, unmistakeably a large _Scylla_ sp.

4.3.5.2 _Cardisoma_ spp. and other large land crabs

The large land crabs, _Cardisoma_ spp., are an important food source in many Oceanic communities
and there are often several terms referring to their growth stages and spawning
behaviour. For example, Foale (1998) reports that in West Gela (central Solomons) females
of the abundant land crab _Cardisoma hirtipes_ migrate to the beach at certain phases in the
lunar cycle in the wet season, from October to December, releasing zoea larvae from their
egg mass (_lami_). This is known as the _sau lami_ (wash eggs). Three weeks before doing this
they migrate to the sea to immerse themselves, an event known as the _sapa toga_ (thousands
go seawards). This is the preferred time to take them because they are fatter. In Fiji, Wayans
refer to the mass migration of _C. hirtipes_ as _vui_.

    POc _*rakum(u)_ is a well attested form which probably referred to a crab of some importance.
Some witnesses (e.g. Kove, Bugotu, Namakir, Woleaian) support attributing final _*u_
to this etymon; others are equivocal. Most sources give uninformative glosses for reflexes
of _*rakum(u)_ but in Mangap (North New Guinea), Roviana (Meso-Melanesian), Puluwatese
and Ponapean (Micronesian), and SE Ambrym (North and Central Vanuatu) these refer to a
land crab. In several languages the reflex has become a term for crabs in general.

4.3.5.3 Grapsidae, (1) shore crabs, (2) burrowing crabs of mud flats

The most commonly seen shore crabs are the grapsids, which forage among rocks and coral
rubble in the intertidal zone. The carapace is squarish, with very convex edges. The last pair
of legs are not flattened but are adapted for climbing over rocks. There are several genera,
including _Grapsus_, _Sesarma_, _Metopograpsus_, and _Leptograpsus_. Oceanic languages typically
distinguish several grapsid taxa. For example, Wayan distinguishes two main taxa within the
Grapsidae: mangrove crabs (_Sesarma_ spp., _Metopograpsus_ spp,), which are _kuka_, and shore
(or rock) crabs (Grapsus spp,), which are _galau_, as well as dividing the generics _kuka_ and
_galau_ into further subtaxa.


4.3.5.4 _Sesarma_ spp., mangrove grapsids

Judging by its reflexes in EOc languages POc _*kuka_ referred chiefly to grapsids of the genus
_Sesarma_, which live in mangrove forest mudflats. In Tolai (MM), Arosi and To’aba’ita (SES)
and Lonwolwol (NCV) the reflex has become a generic term for crabs.

4.3.5.5 Ocypodidae long-stalked crabs (ghost crabs fiddler crabs soldier crabs)

The Ocypodidae are a very distinctive group of small crabs, with eyes on stalks, common on
sandy beaches, mudflats and mangrove forests. There are several genera: _Ocypoda_ spp., ghost
crabs, _Uca_ spp., fiddler crabs, and _Macropthalama_ spp., sentinel or soldier crabs. Oceanic
languages typically distinguish more than one kind by name. Wayan has a generic for ghost
crabs, _koke_, and two specifics for subtaxa. It has a separate generic, _tōlō_, for fiddler and
sentinel crabs.

    There is a well-supported POc term for ghost crabs, which continues a PMP etymon,
_*kaRuki_. WOc and Micronesian witnesses point to POc _*kaRuki_. However, Geraghty (1990:
62) reconstructs _*kaRuiki_ to account for the agreement between Chamorro _haguiki_ (doublet
_haguhi_) and the Central Pacific forms. For both POc and PCP it seems preferable to posit
doublets, which perhaps were careful and fast speech variants. Polynesian and Rotuman reflexes
of PCP _*kauiki_ show reanalysis of unstressed intervocalic _*u_ as _*w_, with subsequent
change of _*w_ > _v_ in some languages.

4.3.5.7 Xanthoidea

The Xanthoidea comprises several families, including Xanthidae, Menippidae and Trapeziidae.
Xanthidae are the typical crabs of coral reefs, emerging at night. There are many species,
quite variable in form but the carapace is usually broad in front, narrow at the rear. Some
species are poisonous. The menippids and trapezids are similar in appearance to the xanthids.
Wayan distinguishes at least three different xanthoids: _motodī_ (some Xanthidae and
Menippidae), _vulau_ (some Xanthidae and Trapeziidae) and _galau ni waitaði_ (probably Libia
tesselata). No POc terms are reconstructable for this group.


4.3.6 Generic terms for crabs

Many Oceanic languages have a uninomial that refers to crabs in general or at least to a
large subclass of crabs, e.g. Molima _kakaʔu_, Maringe _kʰakau_ ‘crabs in general’, To’aba’ita
_ŋuda_  (syn. _ʔuʔa_) ‘general term for crabs except hermit crabs and coconut crabs’. Dictionaries
of many Polynesian languages (including Samoan, East Uvean, East Futunan, Pukapuan and
Tikopia) describe a reflex of PPn _*paka_ as ‘a general term for crabs’ or similar. However, one
must view such glosses with some caution, unless it is clear that the authors have carefully
investigated whether all groups of crabs fall under this rubric.

    Often the generic for crabs also serves as the name of a particular crab taxon that is an
important food source - a kind of polysemy that is common in folk taxonomies worldwide.
For example, in Bauan Fijian the name _gari_, specifically applied to large mud crabs of the
genus _Scylla_, is extended to embrace all typical crabs (tribe Brachyura) other than large land
crabs (_Cardisoma_ spp.). The same is true of the Wayan term, _seka_. However, Wayans do not
regard hermit crabs, coconut crabs and _Thalassina_ (all of which are members of the tribe
Anomura) as _seka_.

    While it is likely that POc had a general term covering some or all crabs we can do little
more than point to three candidates. The strongest of the candidates is probably _*kuka_.

    As noted in §3.5.4, reflexes of POc _*kuka_, which probably referred chiefly to grapsid
crabs that live in mangrove swamps, esp. those of the genus _Sesarma_, serve as a general term
for crabs, or at least typical crabs (i.e. other than Anomura) in certain languages belonging to
three different subgroups: Tolai (MM), Arosi and To’aba’ita (SES), and Lonwolwol (NCV).
Reflexes of _*kuka_ may occur more widely as a generic - relatively few dictionaries and
wordlists provide precise statements about which crab names serve as generics.

    Reflexes of POc _*rakum(u)_ (§3.5.2) occur as a general name for crabs in at least one North
New Guinea language, Mangap, one Papuan Tip language, Dobuan, and one Micronesian
language, Woleaian.

    A term for another grapsid group, POc _*kape_ (§3.5.4), has become a generic covering
both true crabs and hermit crabs in most or all NCV languages (François, pers. comm.). In
Mota and Uripiv (both NCV) the reflex of _*kape_ appears to serve as a generic for a variety
of rock or shore crabs. There are signs that the Arosi reflex of _*kape_ was once a generic for a
range of sea and land crabs because this form now appears only as the first element in several
Arosi compounds.

4.3.7 Other crustaceans

4.3.7.1 Mantis shrimps (order Stomatopoda)

The mantis shrimps, Stomatopoda, are a distinctive group represented by _Squilla_ spp. and
other genera. The fierce, predatory mantis shrimps are prominent denizens of the intertidal
zone. They burrow in sand or hide in crevices and ambush prey. Few sources give names for
these creatures. Among the handful of terms that have been noted, e.g. Gedaged kalompit,
Nduke _hahaka_. Wayan _vidividi_, no widespread cognate set has been found.

4.3.7.2 Barnacles (class Cirripedia, order Thoracia)

Barnacles are shrimp-like crustaceans that superficially resemble externally shelled molluscs.
They attach themselves by the head to a surface and grow a shelly wall of protective plates.
There is a Proto Cristobal-Malaitan form that may have referred to barnacles. This form has
possible cognates in two Meso-Melanesian languages of the western Solomons.

4.3.8 Growth stages and sexes of crustaceans

Oceanic communities often have distinct names for various growth stages and sexes of important
crabs, particularly the larger land crabs and coconut crabs. However, no widespread
cognate sets of this sort have been found.


4.3.9 Body parts of crustaceans

Oceanic languages have names for various parts of crustaceans, e.g. Niuean _tuke_ ‘thorax of a
crab’, _ami_ ‘crab roe’, _afo uŋa_ ‘breeding cord of a female coconut crab’, _nifo_ ‘nippers of land
crab, etc.’ One secure reconstruction can be made.

4.4 Molluscs

4.4.1 Molluscs as a resource in Oceanic communities

Molluscs are very important sources of protein food in Oceanic-speaking coastal communities.
A survey of the Milne Bay coral reef systems recorded 945 species of molluscs living
in reef habitats (Kinch 1999b, Wells and Kinch, 2003). That figure excludes the many species
that occupy mangrove and mudflat habitats, which were not surveyed. While the Milne Bay
region has one of the richest marine faunas in the Pacific, it exemplifies the abundance of
mollusc resources available to communities living close to coral reef systems.

     Unfortunately, few good ethnographic descriptions exist of shellfishing in Oceanic
communities. Languages for which there are near exhaustive lists of mollusc terms distinguish
upwards of 100 taxa. Cemuhi of New Caledonia has around 133 terms for molluscs (Rivierre 1994)
and Paici, another New Caledonian language, has around 100 (Rivierre 1983), Wayan
(Western Fijian) distinguishes more than 140 mollusc taxa, including 105 gastropod, 35
bivalve and four chiton taxa (Pawley and Sayaba 2003). Fox’s (1978) dictionary of Arosi gives
 104 names for kinds of molluscs. Sources for a number of other languages give impressive
totals that are unlikely to be exhaustive. Fox (1974:93) reports that the Lau of NE Malaita
name some 75 kinds of shells. Churchward’s Tongan dictionary lists 63 names for kinds of
shellfish. Waterhouse lists some 60 names for shelled mollusc taxa for Roviana and White
(1988) gives 53 such names for Maringe (Cheke Holo).

     One of the few good ethnographic accounts is a description of shellfishing at Nukakau
Island, West New Britain, by Swadling and Chowning (1981). For the people of Nukakau,
who speak Kove, shellfish are “especially important when fishing is poor and the weather
too rough for fishing parties to go out” (p. 159). The three species that are most collected
are three bivalves: _Geloina coaxans_ (Kove _tue_), which are gathered in mangrove forests,
_Andara granosa_ (Kove _masilau_), gathered from estuarine mudflats, and _Andara antiquata_
(Kove _uleule_), taken from weed-covered coral reef flats. The shells of the first of these are
also used as cutting and scraping tools.

                                                                        Aquatic invertebrates      181

     The importance of shellfish to speakers of Proto Oceanic and its immediate descendants is
shown by the large quantities of gastropod and bivalve shells, and artefacts made from shell,
that are found in Lapita sites (Gifford & Shutler Jr 1956, Kirch 1997, Spriggs 1997a, Swadling 1977, 1996)
and other archaeological sites associated with Oceanic languages. Gifford and Shutler (1956)
identified at least 74 species of molluscs occurring in Lapita sites in New
Caledonia. Swadling (1977) reports 54 mollusc species from the Taurama sequence in Central
Province, Papua New Guinea, beginning around 2000 BP. Tools made from shells included
one-piece fishhooks, adzes made from Tridacna valves and food scrapers from various shell
families. Kirch writes that shell valuables in Lapita sites included “rings, disks, beads and
worked rectangular sections made from various species of marine shell, especially large cone
shells (_Conus leopardus_, _C. litteratus_) _Spondylus_ oysters, _Tridacna_ clam shells and _Trochus_
shells” (Kirch 1997:236).


4.4.2 Class Gastropoda: univalves

The larger Pacific islands and island groups have extensive and varied communities of gastropods.
On the reefs the following families are prominent: Aciidae, Conidae, Strombidae,
Trochidae, Turbinidae. On rocky shores and in mangrove swamps the Neritidae and Cerithidae
predominate.

    POc reconstructions have been made for only a minority of families. A total of seven
POc terms for gastropods are reconstructed here: _*buli(q)_, _*buRua_, _*lala(k)_, _*qaliliŋ_, _*Raŋa_,
_*sisiq_, _*tapuRi_. This is probably less than ten percent of the number of gastropod taxa named
in POc.

4.4.2.1 Strombidae, strombs, spiders, conches

Strombids are the well-known conch and spider shells, which live in sandy and rocky reef
areas. The strombids are an important food source in Oceanic coastal communities. There
is a widely-reflected reconstruction for the spider conch, _Lambis lambis_. It is likely that this
term served as a generic for a range of spider shell taxa, as its reflex does in some daughter
languages.

4.4.2.2 Turbinidae, turbans

The turbans are herbivorous grazers common on intertidal and subtidal reefs, well-known
for the operculum or ‘cat’s eye’ which the animal uses to close off the entrance to its shell.
Turbans are an important food resource. Wayan has a generic for turbans, _kerekere_, as well
as names for several subtaxa, and this pattern appears to be typical of Oceanic languages.

4.4.2.3 Turbopetholatus

For the tapestry turban, Turbopetholatus, there is a well-attested POc reconstruction, _*qaliliŋ_,
which continues a PMP etymon. This term may have served as a generic for the genus.

Usually a number of turban shell taxa are named, sometimes by a compound using a reflex

4.4.2.6 Neritidae, nerites, and allied families of Neritacea

Typical nerites have globular shells with flattened base. They are vegetarians, living under
rocks or in crevices close to the high tide mark. The nerite family contains marine, freshwater
and terrestrial species. The wide range and abundance of nerites, and their importance as food,
may explain why the generic for this family has come to be used as a generic for a wider range
of gastropods in a number of Oceanic languages, including Takia, Roviana, Bauan, Wayan
and Samoan.

     Some WOc and NCV languages reflect _*siseq_ or _*sisaq_ rather than _*sisiq_. These departures
can be explained in terms of dissimilatory change in which the final, unstressed vowel
is lowered. Dissimilation of the final vowel, _*sisiq_ > _sisu_ > _susu_, also explains Motu _dudu_
for expected _*didi_.

4.4.2.7 Cypraeidae (cowries) and Ovulidae (egg and spindle cowries)

Many species of cowries are present. The white or egg cowrie (_Ovula ovum_) is used in some
societies as a decoration associated with chiefs and chiefly property. In Fiji, for example, these
shells are hung from the ridge-pole of a chief’s house and in the western Solomons they are
used as prow ornaments on war canoes. Oceanic languages generally classify cowries and
ovulids together under a single generic with subtaxa distinguished by binomials. There is a
well-attested POc reconstruction which continues a PMP etymon.

4.4.2.8 Trochidae, top shells

The Trochidae are a family of shallow water dwellers, represented by many species, with
conical shells and flat or convex circular base. Some are a valued food resource. Oceanic
peoples traditionally made ornaments, such as arm and wrist bracelets, from trochus shell.
Oceanic languages usually have a generic term for the family and several binomials naming
subtaxa. There is a good chance that the term _lalai_, which entered Tok Pisin from Tolai,
has spread from Tok Pisin into many vernacular languages of Papua New Guinea and the
Solomons.

4.4.2.9 Conidae, cone shells

The Conidae are all conical in shape, usually with long narrow aperture and smooth outer lip.
Species vary greatly in length, ranging from 6 mm to 230 mm. The Conidae are carnivores
and inflict a venom with a radular dart on the proboscis. The larger shells are much used
for making bracelets and rings. There is a term attributable to PEOc whose SES reflexes
generally refer both to the shell itself and to bracelets and other ornaments made of cone or
trochus shell.

    Proto Southeast Solomonic _*kome_ evidently referred to a particular kind of armlet, made from
_*lako_ shell. A partially or fully reduplicated form, _*ko-kome_ or _*komekome_, may have been
a general name for cone shells in Proto Southeast Solomonic. However, given that _*kome_ referred
to a valuable trade good, this term may well have spread by borrowing among languages of
the central and eastern Solomons.

4.4.2.11 Gastropod families lacking POc names

For many groups of gastropods present in the tropical Pacific region no reconstructions have
been made to POc level, even though names for these groups are present in contemporary languages.
For example, POc names are missing for limpets (Patellidae), key-hole limpets (Fissurellidae),
ceriths (Cerithidae), cones (Conidae), dog-whelks (Nassaridae), mud-whelks (Potomididae),
helmet shells (Cassidae), tun shells (Tonnidae), miters (Mitridae), augers (Terebridae),
turrids (Turridae) and drupes (Thaidinae).


4.4.2.12 Generic terms for gastropods

For a small minority of Oceanic languages the sources give a term that applies to gastropods
in general or to a wide range of gastropods. The fact that reflexes of POc _*sisiq_ have this
semantic range in a North New Guinea language (Takia _sisef_), and in the Fijian languages
(Wayan _ðiði_, Bauan _siði_) might suggest that _*sisiq_ also had a similar range in POc. However,
comparison of the larger sample of cognates listed in §4.2.8 suggests that it is at least as likely
that POc _*sisiq_ was a more restricted generic, referring to various small gastropod families
and that more than once it independently became a term for edible gastropods in general. See
ch. 8 for further discussion. Marovo (Meso-Melanesian) has a generic, _chuko_, that embraces
most small to medium-sized gastropods but excludes nerites and turbans (Hviding 2005:67).


4.4.3 class Bivalvia: clams, cockles, oysters, etc.

   There are ten pretty secure POc reconstructions for kinds of bivalves: _*japi_, _*kaRi_, _*kasi_
_*kuku_, _*kima_, _*sapulu(q)_, _*tiRom_, _*tu(qu)asi_, _*tu(q)e-tu(q)e_ and _*(w,y)aro_.

Figure 4.7: _Tridacna gigas_, giant clam


4.4.5.1 Tridacninae, giant clams

Giant clams are a small but economically important group that includes the largest externally
shelled molluscs. The largest species (_Tridacna gigas_) grows up to a metre long. Traditionally
regarded as a separate family, this group has recently been reclassified as a subfamily
Tridacninae of Cardiidae. Giant clams are prized food, consumed at ceremonial feasts. In
some societies edge-ground adze blades and shell rings were made from the heavy shells.
Typically Oceanic languages have a generic referring to all Tridacna, with several binomials
distinguishing subtaxa. Thus Arosi _ʔima_ is the generic and there are eight binomials (including
one pair of synonyms) denoting subtaxa. Wayan has _vāsua_ as the generic and has three
subtaxa: _(vasua) cavucavu_, _Tridacna gigas_, the largest kind, which is easily removed, and is symbolic
of women because they marry away from home; _kativatu_, _T. maxima_, is hard to remove
and is symbolic of men, who stay with their father’s clan; and _vosavosa_, the fluted clam,
_T. squamosa_.

    There is a well-attested POc generic for giant clams, _*kima_, with a PMP antecedent.

    Reflexes of _*kima_ are absent from Central Pacific, where it was evidently replaced by

    The Gela and Arosi comparisons are problematic but they provide evidence, consistent
with some Eastern Polynesian witnesses, that PCP _*(b,v)asua_ derived from a pre Central
Pacific form that referred to a group of bivalves other than the Tridacninae.

4.4.3.2 _Asaphis_ spp. (Psammobidae) and cockles (Cardiidae)

There is a well-supported POc form, _*kasi_, which referred to to the action of grating or scraping,
to scrapers made from the valves of circular bivalves, such as _Asaphis_ (Psammobidae)
and cockles (Cardiidae spp.) and to the shellfish themselves, which are good eating. The
vernacular term ‘cockle’ is used loosely in many sources, referring not just to shells of the
Cardiidae family but also to other small to medium-sized rounded bivalves with radial or
concentric striae, including Psammobidae and Tellinidae.

4.4.3.3 Mytilidae, mussels

Mussels occur in dense colonies on rocky shores, attaching themselves to surfaces by byssus
threads. They fall into several subfamilies. _Mytilus_ spp. predominate in cold waters but in
tropical waters they are replaced by species of the subfamilies Modiolinae and Lithophaginae.
Commonly Oceanic languages distinguish two or more mussel taxa by name, e.g. Wayan has
a generic term _boro_, with two subtaxa: _boro boro_, probably _Modiolus plumescens_, and _drivi_
‘small mussels with black shell, possibly _Lithophaga_ sp.

    Blust (1972:10) relates POc _*kuku(r)_ ‘? mussel sp.’ to PAn _*kuDkuD_ ‘rasp, file’, noting
reflexes such as Tagalog _kudkod_, Toba Batak _hurhur_ ‘grated’, Ngadju Dayak _kukur_ ‘rasp,
grater’. It is likely that POc _*kuku(r)_ was polysemous, referring both to food scrapers of
various kinds of shells and to mussels, which were used as scrapers.

4.4.3.4 Ostreidae, rock oysters

The English folk category ‘oyster’ refers to several families of bivalves, including Ostreidae
(typical oysters), Isognomonidae (mangrove oysters), Malleidae (hammer oysters), Pteridae
(pearl and wing oysters) and Spondylidae (thorny oysters), the latter being more closely related
to scallops than to the other ‘oyster’ families. Wayan Fijian has a generic term, _ðiva_,
with a similarly broad range of reference.

    POc _*tiRom_ continues a PAn term for oyster. The range of the POc term probably included
both typical oysters (Ostreidae), which attach themselves by cementing one valve to rocks or
wood, and tree oysters (Isognominidae), found mainly among mangrove roots or under rocks
in the intertidal zone. Only a few species of Isognomonidae occur in the Pacific Islands.

4.4.3.5 Pteridae, pearl and wing oysters, and Malleidae, hammer oysters

The family Pteridae includes pearl and wing oysters, which live on rocky ocean floors. They
have moderate to large shells with one valve more inflated, with pearly interior. The Malleidae,
hammer oysters, have ears drawn out into elongate wings. The common hammer oyster,
_Malleus malleus_, anchors to the bottom in shallow reef waters.

    The gold-lip pearl shell, _Pinctada maxima_, and the black-lip pearl, _Pinctada margaritifera_, were
traditionally important as a trade item and source of ornaments, especially the breastplate
crescent made from the lip of this shell and worn by men. Although they are widely distributed
species Swadling (1994) reports that the environmental conditions for dense concentrations
of gold- and black-lip pearl shells occur only in a few parts of Papua New Guinea (Manus
Province, Ramoaaina Islands, Arawe Islands, Brooker and Moturina in the Calvados chain,
eastern Milne Bay Province, and the Torres Strait Islands). Pearl oysters are absent from the
more southerly subtropical parts of Polynesia, and in some other parts of Polynesia, including
Tonga and Samoa, occur in locations that were not easily accessible to divers. The importance
of pearl shell ornaments as trade valuables no doubt led to borrowing of the names for these
in some regions. However, the fact that reflexes of _*japi_, showing regular sound shifts, are
found from New Guinea to Polynesia is strong evidence of the POc antiquity of this term.

The Pinnidae or pen shells have large fragile shells. They live buried in soft sand anchored
by a silk byssus. The following reconstruction is tentatively associated with the genus _Pinna_
because of the Gela and Fijian reflexes. In Cristobal-Malaita languages the reflex refers to
black mussels, from which bonito hooks are made.

4.4.3.7 Lucinidae and allied families

Lucinoidea (Lucinidae and three other families) are often the dominant bivalves in shallow
sea grass bed habitats, esp. species of _Codakia_, _Ctena_, _Lucina_, _Lucinisca_, _Loripes_ and
_Anodonta_, and are an important food source. The Lucinidae have certain unusual anatomical
features including a foot, used for burrowing, that can be extended 4 to 6 times the length
of the animal. There is no secure POc reconstruction for this family but the following is a

4.4.3.8 Reconstructions for bivalves of uncertain family

Some etyma have reflexes that are so semantically diverse or so vaguely glossed in the sources
that the reconstructed name cannot be associated with a particular family. For POc _*sisira_
‘a barnacle or k.o. small mollusc’ see §3.6. The following reconstruction is very tentative,
because the putative cognates are few and because the semantic agreement is weak.

    The following term may have referred both to a bivalve shellfish and to spoons or graters
made from its shell. Only a single WOc reflex has been noted. The Niuatoputapu reflex points
to PPn _*tuquahi_, with glottal stop, whereas the Tongan reflex points to _*tuahi_. Those Polynesian

4.4.3.9 Bivalve families lacking definite POc reconstructions

There are several prominent families of bivalves for which no definite POc names can be
reconstructed. These include scallops (Pectinidae), thorny oysters (Spondylidae), jewelboxes
(Chamidae), tellins (Tellinidae), sanguins (Garidae), wedge shells (Donacidae), venus shells
(Veneridae), and olives (Olividae).

4.4.3.10 Generic term for bivalves

Some contemporary languages have a generic covering all or most bivalves. This is often a
polysemous term, which also refers to an important specific taxon. For example, the Bauan
generic _kai_ is also the term for cockles, Wayan _tavē_ is also the term for tellins and sanguins.
In several Polynesian languages reflexes of PPn _*pipi_, probably originally referring chiefly
to cockles, has become a generic for a wide range of bivalves (§4.3.2).


4.4.4 Polyplacophora: chitons

Chitons are flattened, slug-like molluscs, most species covered with eight shingle-like plates.
They feed on algae. Chitons are usually represented in Oceanic languages by a uninomial
generic (e.g. Gedaged _dabag_) and some languages also have several binomials naming specific kinds.
There is a well-supported PEOc reconstruction but there are no certain cognates
in WOc.

198     Andrew Pawley

    In PPn _*mama_ replaced _*tadruku_ as the generic for chitons. PPn _*mama_ is probably
cognate with Southeast Solomonic _*mama_, referring to a kind of anemone or jellyfish (see
§6.3).

  Pn:      Marquesan    mama           ‘_Chiton magnificus_’
>


4.4.5 A term for shellfish in general

Did POc speakers have a name for shellfish (shelled molluscs) in general? As noted in section
1, POc had a broad collective term, _*pinaŋoda_, denoting ‘marine invertebrates, sea animals
other than fish gathered on the reef’. In a few languages the reflex has become a general
term for bivalves and gastropods, sometimes also including sea urchins, e.g. Samoan _fiŋota_
‘generic for shelled molluscs and other invertebrates’, Tokelauan _fiŋota_ ‘bivalves, gastropods
and sea urchins’.

    A term specifically denoting all and only shellfish is present in some Oceanic languages.
For example, Foale (1998) reports that Gela (SES) _vaŋuda_ is normally used as generic for
molluscs but can be extended to include crustaceans and echinoderms. Lau (SES) has a noncognate
form with similar function: _karoŋo_ (1) ‘shelled mollusc, marine or land’; (2) ‘any
invertebrate collected on reef at low tide: shellfish, crabs, squids’, as does Niuean _fua_
‘shellfish and echinoderms’. Motu (PT) has _bisisi_ ‘general name for all shellfish’ and Takia (NNG)
has _sisei_ ‘generic for all varieties of shells’. Akimichi and Sakiyama (1991) report that
Penchal (Adm) _mʷel_ has two senses: (1) ‘shellfish’; (2)‘shellfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers’
and that in nearby Lenkau the cognate term _mʷe_ also has two senses: (1) ‘shellfish’ and (2)
‘shellfish, cephalopods and sea urchins and sea cucumbers’. We can conclude that POc may
well have had a general term for shellfish. However, in the absence of a widespread cognate
set no reconstruction can be made.


4.4.6 Cephalopoda: octopus, squid, nautilus

The cephalopods include (1) the octopus and argonaut group, with eight tentacles; (2) the
squid and spirula group, with ten, and (3) the chambered nautilus, which inhabits the deep
sea and is rarely encountered alive. Groups (1) and (2) are valued food sources.

4.4.6.1 Octopus

Several species of octopus occur in the Pacific, two common ones being _Octopus cyanea_, the
day octopus or common reef octopus, and the smaller _Octopus ornatus_, the night octopus. Some
Oceanic languages name several different taxa by size, shape and habits. There is a
widely-reflected generic going back to PAn.

4.4.6.2 Squid and cuttlefish

Squids have 10 arms and a thin, plastic-like internal shell, which in the cuttlefish (_Sepia_
spp.) takes the form of a flat rigid bone. Several squid and cuttlefish species occur in Pacific
shallow waters, ranging in size from just a few cm to quite large.

    POc had at least two terms for squid/cuttlefish taxa: _*nusa_ (with doublet _*nus_) and _*mʷanagi_
(with doublet _*mʷamʷagi_).

    _*nusa_ and _*nus_ seem to have referred to small squid and small cuttlefish. Blust (1986)
reconstructs PMP _*nus_ ‘squid, cuttlefish’, based on forms such as Malay _nus_ ‘generic for
cephalopods’ and Roti _nus_ ‘octopus, squid’, with a doublet _*kanuqus_. _*nusa_ is reflected by
the following:

4.4.7 Parts of molluscs

Oceanic languages usually have names for various parts of molluscs including beak, tentacles,
suckers of octopus, mantle, foot, proboscis, gonads, innards of shellfish, shell, valve and hinge
of bivalves, etc. Only a few part names are reconstructable to the level of POc.

4.4.8 Artefacts made from shell

As indicated in §4.1, POc speakers made a variety of artefacts from shell. Reconstructed terms
include a number which refer both to the shell and animal and to the artefact made from the
shell: _*japi_ ‘crescent breast ornament made from pearl shell, probably worn by high status
men’ (§4.3.5), _*lala(k)_ ‘rings or armlets of trochus shell’ (§4.2.8), _*tapuRiq_ ‘trumpet, of triton
shell’ (§4.2.5), _*buli(q)_ ‘cowry shell sinkers’ (§4.2.7), _*kaRi_, _*kasi_, and _*kuku(r)_ ‘cutting and
scraping instruments of bivalve shells’ (§4.3.2, §4.3.5). A few terms for artefacts sometimes
or usually made from shell can be reconstructed, e.g. _*kiRam_ ‘adze or axe (generic but applied
to edge-ground axes made of tridacna shell), _*kawil_ ‘fish-hook’, and _*sabi-sabi_ ‘shell disk
used as ear-ring (in Massim made of _Chama pacifica_) (see vol. 1, p. 104).


4.5 Echinodermata: sea urchins, sea cucumbers, starfish, etc.

The echinoderms include sea urchins (sea-eggs), sea cucumbers, starfish, brittle stars, feather
stars and sand dollars. All possess tube feet and have a body pattern structured in fives. However,
the various groups are very diverse in form.


4.5.1 Echinoidea: sea urchins

Sea urchins are represented in Oceania by numerous genera and species. These include long-
spined echinoderms (esp. Echinothrix and Diadema spp,), short-spined rock-boring urchins
(_Echinometra_ spp.) and slate pencil urchins, Heterocentrus mammilatus. Some sea urchins
are eaten. It is seems that few Oceanic languages have a folk generic covering all sea urchins.
In Wayan echinoderms are recognised as a covert taxon, sometimes referred to by a phrase
meaning ‘spiky animals of the reef’.

4.5.1.1 _Echinometra_ spp., rock-boring urchins

There is a POc reconstruction for short-spined rock-boring urchins, _Echinometra_ spp., and
possibly also _Tripneustes_ spp.

4.5.2 Holothuroidea: sea cucumbers (bêche de mer, trepang, holothurians)

4.5.2.1 Terms for specific taxa

Firm-bodied sea cucumbers are relatively short and fat, with tube feet on the ventral surface.
The thin-bodied, worm-like sea cucumbers lack tube feet. Some sea cucumbers are eaten by
Oceanic communities. Tongan distinguishes some 18 sea cucumber taxa (Churchward 1959)
and Wayan about 19 (Pawley and Sayaba 2003).

   Blust (2002) reconstructs PWMP _*balat_ ‘sea cucumber’ but no Oceanic cognates have
been noted. Only one POc term for a sea cucumber taxon has been reconstructed, _*(b,p)ula_.

    There is a POc reconstruction, _*qanupe_, whose meaning is indeterminate between ‘caterpillar’
and ‘k.o. sea cucumber’. All known WOc reflexes refer to sea cucumbers while all
Eastern Oceanic reflexes refer to caterpillars (see ch.7, §17). When glossing the POc etymon
one cannot, without external cognates, determine which of these two competing glosses was
original, or indeed whether the POc form has two senses. In Wayan Fijian the English loan
_katavila_ refers both to caterpillars and to a kind of sea cucumber with caterpillar-like spiky
protrusions.

4.5.2.2 General term for sea cucumbers

Oceanic languages commonly have a general term for sea cucumbers, or more specifically for
firm-bodied holothurids with tubular feet. (Long thin, soft-bodied holothurids lacking tubular
feet are often classified as ‘worms’.) In the Fijian languages the generic term for firm-bodied
holothurids is _drī_, in Marovo it is _puhaka_, in Nelemwa it is _imale_ and in Hawaiian and Niuean
it is _loli_. But in the absence of agreement across high-order subgroups no generic can be
attributed to POc.


4.5.3 Asteroidea: sea stars and Ophiuroidea: starfish

Oceanic languages usually distinguish by name a number of starfish. The sole POc term for
starfish reconstructed so far continues a PMP etymon.

<

   Cushion stars, _Culcita_ spp., are plump, round starfish with short arms. No POc lexical
form is recoverable but it is noteworthy that Marovo and the Fijian languages agree in naming
cushion stars by expressions that mean ‘(possession) of a shark’; thus: Marovo _beibeiani te kiso_
(‘lit. ‘shark’s drinking water’), Bauan _kali ni qio_, Wayan _kali ni ikō_ (both lit. ‘shark’s
pillow’). This suggests that the naming pattern is of POc antiquity, even though the forms are
not cognate.


4.6 Cnidaria and Ctenophora: anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydroids

The phylum _Cnidaria_ (formerly _Coelenterata_) consists of four classes of animals: _Anthozoa_
(anemones and corals), _Scyphozoa_ (jellyfish), _Ctenophora_ (comb jellyfish) and _Hydrozoa_
(hydroids) which have nettle-like stinging hairs or tentacles used to capture prey.

    There are two main classes of _Anthozoa_, (1) soft corals, colonial polyps having flexible
skeletons that produce spicules of calcium carbonate, with feathery tentacles, and (2) stony
corals and sea anemones, with tentacles in multiples of six. Stony corals have a hard skeleton.
True anemones have no skeleton and a fleshy body, with circlets of tentacles, often brightly
coloured, in contrast to colonial anemones which form a green mat on rocks and rubble.


4.6.1 Anemones

No POc term denoting anemones is reconstructable on present evidence. A problem is that
few dictionaries of WOc languages provide a term for this group of animals. Proto Remote Oceanic
_*druman(e,i)_ ‘anemone’ has reflexes in North and Central Vanuatu, Fijian, Rotuman and Polynesian.

<
Proto Remote Oceanic *druman(e,i) ‘anemone’

  Pn:   Ifira-Mele   (a)rumani   ‘anemone’
>

    _*druman(e,i)_ has no certain antecedent in POc but may derive from POc _*droman_ ‘leech’,
with semantic change and addition of a final vowel. Note that the NCV reflexes of _*droman_
show an initial high vowel and, in some cases, a labiovelar second consonant, pointing to
PNCV _*ruma_ ‘leech’.

4.6.2 Corals

Corals are colonies of small polyps which secrete a hard skeleton, forming a base on which the
colony grows. Soft corals include sea fans, sea whips, sea feathers and sea blades. Hard corals
include brain coral, staghorn coral and branching corals. Stony corals form a boulder, with
the polyps emerging only at night. The distinctive brain corals are formed by coralettes clustering
so close that they form sinuous valleys. Shallow underwater corals secrete limestone
skeletons. The limestone is useful for a variety of purposes, including rubble for building
house foundations and floors, and for making plaster. A rough, porous white coral is used as
an abrasive in woodwork.

    Oceanic languages generally have a generic name for living corals of the branching type
and often distinguish several kinds. The Arosi dictionary lists eight different coral taxa,
including six kinds of branching coral. However, dictionaries and wordlists seldom provide
clear zoological identifications.

4.6.3 Scyphozoa, Ctenophora and Hydrozoa: true jellyfish, comb jellyfish and hydroids

Figure 4.10: _Physalis_ sp., Portuguese man o’ war

True jellyfish (_Scyphozoa_) are members of the
_Cnidaria_, whose tentacles face down. They represent the medusa or free-swimming phase of
_Scyphozoa_, preceding their polyp phase. _Ctenophora_, comb jellyfish, are colourless, oval blobs of jelly
that float slowly. _Hydrozoa_ are polyps which form fuzz-like colonies on rocks, after a brief phase as a
free-swimming organism. This group includes fire corals, hydroids and siphonophores. Hydroids are
feathery colonial organisms growing on the surface of coral.

    Oceanic languages often distinguish several different kinds of jellyfish, including the
spectacular Portugese man o’ war or bluebottle (_Physalia physalia_) but no POc terms for any jellyfish taxa are
recoverable. Two PPn terms for jellyfish are reconstructable. One, referring to the Portuguese
man o’war, is well supported and has a cognate in Bauan Fijian, where it refers to a hydroid.

4.7 Annelida: worms

Many annelid (segmented) worms live in tropical marine habitats. The two main groups
are _Oligochaeta_ (with few bristles) and _Polychaeta_ (with many bristles). Marine worms are
mainly _Polychaeta_ and include fireworms, feather duster worms, sphagetti worms, Christmas
tree worms and bobbit or palolo worms. Reconstructions are available for just two marine
worm taxa.

Although this cognate set formally matches PMP _*imbaw_ ‘marine mollusc sp.’ (Blust 1980b: 77)
the latter reconstruction rests on cognates in two WMP languages which both refer to
bivalves.


4.7.2 Fireworms (Polychaeta)

Fireworms, 5-18 cm long, bear many white bristles along their sides which can cause itching
when touched. They bear a superficial resemblance to centipedes and millipedes. A well-supported
PMP and POc reconstruction for ‘centipede’ exists, namely _*qalipan_, continued
in PCP as _*qaliva_ ‘millipede’. A separate term for ‘fireworm’, sometimes called ‘sea centipede’,
is attributable to POc based on agreements between Saliba, a Papuan Tip language,
and Polynesian witnesses. It appears that in PPn a single term, _*weli_, was applied both to
fireworms and to centipedes and furry millipedes. Glosses given to cognates in North-Central
Vanuatu and Southeast Solomonic suggest that this range of reference may well have existed
in POc.

4.7.3 Palolo worm (_Eunice viridis_, aka _Palola viridis_, _Leodis viridis_)

The palolo worm is distributed from Indonesia to the central Pacific. It burrows into coral.
When spawning, the posterior end, filled with sperm and eggs, breaks off and swims to the
surface. The annual spawning or ‘rise’, governed by the phase of the moon, occurs at regular
times in the months October to December and at these times people scoop up the worms
which are cooked and eaten.

    A name for the palolo worm is attributable to PEOc, based on cognates shared by SES
and NCV languages. The former reflect _*odu_, the latter _*udu_. The only known WOc cognate
occurs in a Santa Isabel language, Maringe: _na-udu_, where _na-_ reflects the POC common
noun marker _*na_. The Maringe form may be a borrowing from a neighbouring SES language
but it is noteworthy that its first vowel agrees with NCV rather than SES witnesses.

4.8 Poriphera: sponges

Sponges are conspicuous inhabitants of coral reefs. They come in a variety of shapes and
sizes, attaching themselves wherever they can find a space. Some Oceanic languages have
a general term for sponges, e.g. Lau _losi_, _lo-losi_, Gela _loi-losi_, Roviana _puha_, Dobuan _halu_,
Motu _puta_, Sa’a _hulo_, but no widespread cognate sets have been noted, other than the following
from Polynesian languages.

  Pn:     Marquesan     oma-oma         ‘k.o. jellyfish’
>


4.9 What proportion of POc taxa have been reconstructed?

Leaving aside the collective term _*pinaŋoda_, the number of fairly secure POc reconstructions
for aquatic (including semi-aquatic) invertebrate taxa is 42, with a few additional tentative
reconstructions at POc level and a number of other reconstructions attributable to PEOc or
PWOc. Taking the Wayan figure of about 240 taxa as fairly typical of those Austronesian
maritime communities which exploit fringing reefs and mangrove swamps, it follows that 42
is probably less than a fifth of the total number of aquatic taxa distinguished by POc speakers.
The breakdown in Table 4.2, comparing Wayan with POc, indicates the distribution of the
shortfalls across the main groups of aquatic invertebrates.

    The relative paucity of POc reconstructions can be attributed in large part to gaps in the
coverage provided by dictionaries of contemporary languages. Few dictionaries give anything
like an exhaustive listing of terms for invertebrates. However, a pattern is discernable
in the kinds of terms that can/cannot be reconstructed. One important category of terms
almost completely missing from our reconstructions is binomials. A run through the list of
reconstructions shows that all the POc terms are uninomials (unitary lexemes). By contrast,
about a third of the Wayan names are binomials, including 40 of the 105 gastropod taxa, but
only seven of the 35 bivalve taxa.

    Why are uninomials more stable than binomials? Berlin (1992) argues that in folk
taxonomies of wild animals and plants the most salient and well-marked categories for purposes
of identification are folk generics (see ch. 8, §1.2.3). Names of taxa at the level of folk generic
are usually uninominals (e.g. English _owl_, _whale_, _oak_, _willow_) or idioms, e.g. _blackbird_,
_she-oak_, _pussy willow_). A folk generic may have a number of folk specifics, which are perceived
as closely related but distinct types. These are typically known by binomials, made up of a
folk generic plus a descriptive modifier which refers to one or another distinguishing feature
of the taxon - its characteristic habitat, colour, size, shape, etc., e.g. _barn owl_, _grass owl_,
_sooty owl_, _hump-backed whale_, _blue whale_. Folk generics commonly fall under high-order
taxa, particularly the type that Berlin calls a life-form, such as English _fish_, _bird_, _snake_, and
_tree_. Sometimes levels between life-form and folk generic are distinguished and Berlin calls
these intermediates.

    The POc terms for aquatic invertebrates that have survived are exclusively generics of
some sort, either folk generics or high-order generics. The modifiers that distinguish folk
specifics have not been stable. There are, perhaps, several reasons why modifiers are unstable.
One is the variability of local species. Although the same orders, families and genera of
common reef and shoreline animals are usually common to different regions of the tropical
Pacific, the species are more variable from region to region. Migrants might be expected to
apply new modifiers to newly encountered species if these were clearly distinct from those
known in their former homeland. Another factor is the wide range of distinctive characteristics
exhibited by certain species and genera of the same family, such as colour, shape, size and
behaviour. Speakers can be expected from time to time to change the choice of the characteristic
used to distinguish one taxon terminologically from its sister taxa. Finally, particular
modifying terms may themselves be replaced by synonyms which come into favour, sometimes
leading to loss or change of meaning in the original modifier.

     Some groups of invertebrates show a much higher ratio of taxa reconstructed to POc level
than others, when compared with Wayan totals. Among the crustaceans, the Anomura (hermit
crabs) have a high ratio with 4/4, whereas the Brachyura (true crabs) score only 7/33. Prawns
and shrimps score much lower (1/7), the sole POc term reconstructed being the generic for
prawns and lobsters. Sea cucumbers and sea urchins also show a very low ratio: three POc
reconstructions compared with 27 taxa distinguished in Wayan. The cephalopods (3/4) have
by far the highest ratios among the molluscs. The bivalves (10/35) score much higher than
the gastropods (7/105), a difference not solely attributable to the fact that binomials make up
 40 of the 105 Wayan gastropod names but only 7 of the 35 bivalve names.

    These ratios can be taken as a very rough measure of how persistent POc names have
been for particular invertebrate groups: a high score for POc indicates a high retention rate
of terms in daughter languages, a low score the converse. Very likely there is a correlation
between how persistent a term is, and how salient or important the referent is to to members
of the speech community. Of course, a creature can be salient for any of a number of reasons:
economic importance, large size, unusual appearance, being dangerous, and so on. Closer
study of such matters must be left for another occasion.



5 Mammals, reptiles, amphibians

5.1 Introduction

This chapter is concerned with the Proto Oceanic lexicon for three groups of vertebrates:
mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Birds and fish each have a chapter to themselves.[1]

    Attempts to reconstruct POc names for land vertebrates face a number of difficulties. The
most fundamental of these relate to discontinuities in the fauna that reflect long-established
ocean gaps. Most mammal and reptile species, of course, live on land and cannot cross large
ocean gaps. As a consequence cognate sets for certain animal taxa have highly restricted
distributions. This is especially true of mammals.

    A major zoogeographical boundary divides the mammals native to the Austronesian-speaking
world. The Wallace Line, which runs north-south through the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago,
separating Sumatra, Borneo, Java and Bali from islands to the east, marks (among
other things) the westernmost limits of marsupial mammals. West of this boundary
only placental mammals occur. The native land mammals that would have been familiar to speakers of
Proto Oceanic, living in the Bismarck Archipelago, were almost entirely different from those
known to their ancestors in the Proto Malayo-Polynesian homeland, and from those found in
Remote Oceania, where most of the best-described Oceanic languages are now spoken.

    East of the Wallace Line there is a region of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago, Wallacea,
where relatively few land mammals occur but there is some overlap between placentals
and marsupials. Lydekker’s Line forms the eastern boundary of Wallacea. It separates the
Australia-New Guinea faunal zone, home to a rich marsupial fauna, from the islands of eastern
Indonesia: Sulawesi, Lombok, Flores, Timor, and the Moluccas. Only bats and rodents
are common to both the Asian and the Australia-New Guinea regions.

Map 5: Major zoogeographical boundaries in Island Southeast Asia

    These faunal regions reflect geomorphological boundaries. The islands west of Wallace’s
Line lie on the Sunda Shelf, a shallow continental shelf that was dry land at various times
during the ice ages. As a consequence, the western islands of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago
share a similar mammal fauna with the Southeast Asian mainland and, to a lesser extent,
with the Philippines and Taiwan. However, a deep trench separates Bali from Lombok, and
few Asian mammal species were able to cross this. Similarly, during parts of the ice ages
Australia and New Guinea formed a single land mass, Sahul (also known as Greater Australia
or Meganesia), but were always separated from the Moluccas and Timor by deep water. Also
part of Sahul were the Aru Islands southwest of New Guinea, but not the Kei Islands. Off
the Bird’s Head, the West Papuan islands of Batanta, Gebe, Waigeo, Salawati and Misool
(Mysol) were included, as were the islands of Cenderawasih Bay (Biak, Yapen, Numfoor)
and the islands of the north coast shelf (Kairiru, Manam, Karkar, Bagabag). At the south end
of New Guinea the D’Entrecasteaux Group, Louisiade Archipelago, Woodlark Island and the
Trobriands were all part of the mainland. However, New Britain, New Ireland, the Solomons
and the Admiralties were still separated from the New Guinea mainland and each other.

    Robert Blust (1982, 2002, 2009a) has demonstrated the relevance of the Wallace Line to
the subgrouping of Austronesian languages. In the most generally accepted subgrouping of
Austronesian languages, all the Austronesian languages of New Guinea fall into a lower order
group, namely Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. Blust writes

|       Since placental mammals are not native to areas east of the Wallace Line, PAN and PMP
|       must have been spoken west of that boundary. In crossing the Wallace Line [Austronesian]
|       speakers would have encountered marsupials for the first time. If this happened
|       through separate migrations into eastern Indonesia and the western Pacific there would
|       be no basis for expecting that the terms for marsupial mammals would be cognate, since
|       they would have been independently invented (or borrowed) at different times and in
|       different places. As it happens, however, many languages of eastern Indonesia and the
|       Pacific reflect _*kandoRa_ ‘cuscus’ and _*mansar/manser_ ‘bandicoot/marsupial rat’ which
|       could not have been present in PAN or PMP.

|       … it is simplest to attribute these innovations to a single speech community that was
|       ancestral to the [Central Malayo-Polynesian, South Halmahera-West New Guinea and
|       Oceanic] languages (2009a: 715-716).

Further significant zoogeographical boundaries occur within Oceania. As one travels from
the New Guinea mainland to the Bismarck Archipelago, then east down the main Solomons
chain and on into Remote Oceania, the land masses become smaller and the island groups
further apart, and the faunal range declines markedly. Relatively few species of terrestrial
mammals are widely distributed across Oceania. A good many taxa are restricted to New
Guinea or to New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland.

    Reptiles and amphibians are not subject to the same geographical division. Terms for
both crocodile and turtle occur on both sides of the Wallace Line and are reconstructable to
PAn. Crocodiles were formerly present in Taiwan (see footnote on p.251), and their present
breeding range extends from south-west India and the Philippines to the Santa Cruz group.
Lizards and snakes are capable of swimming short distances, and are readily transportable on
floating logs or rafts of vegetation, but the number of species shrinks as land masses decline
in size and island groups become more widely scattered.

    In the most generally accepted subgrouping of Austronesian languages, all the Austronesian
languages of New Guinea fall into a lower order group, namely Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.
It follows that for kinds of mammals found only in New Guinea we will not
find a Proto Austronesian (PAn) or Proto Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) reconstruction.

    The mammals known to POc speakers may be divided into those indigenous to the
Bismarck Archipelago[2] and perhaps the north coast of New Guinea and those that humans
brought to this region from island southeast Asia, namely the pig and dog and certain rat
species.

5.2 Indigenous terrestrial mammals

5.2.1 Introduction


                                                             Mammals, reptiles, amphibians   221


The indigenous mammal groups of Melanesia recorded in historic times are listed by
Flannery (1995a: 13-15). The main island of New Guinea has one tree kangaroo genus and four genera
of wallabies. It has several species of bandicoot and a large variety of possums, including
cuscuses, pygmy possums, ringtail possums and gliders. It has two genera of spiny ant-eaters
(monotremes). A less well known family is the Dasyuridae (formerly known as _Phascogale_),
a family to which Tasmanian devils belong. The New Guinea dasyurids consist of quolls
and antechinuses. The Bismarcks have only one bandicoot, one wallaby, and two species
of phalanger. The Solomons have one phalanger. Murids and bats are represented by many
different genera throughout New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Solomons. In Vanuatu, New
Caledonia, Fiji, Polynesia and Micronesia, the only native terrestrial mammals are bats. The
range of a few indigenous mammals has been extended by human introductions.


5.2.2 Macropodidae

5.2.2.1 Wallabies (Genera _Dorcopsis_, _Dorcopsulus_, _Macropus_, _Thylogale_)

Four genera of wallabies occur in the New Guinea area. _Dorcopsis_ is a genus of small
rainforest wallabies with an extensive range round the perimeter of New Guinea. One species,
the black dorcopsis, is common on mountainous Goodenough Island in the D’Entrecasteaux
group. A second genus, _Dorcopsulus_, the smallest of all the Macropodids, lives in mountain
forests. A third genus, _Macropus_, the large sandy or agile wallaby, is primarily a savanna
woodland animal of the south-eastern New Guinea mainland, but is also found on many of
the Trobriand and D’Entrecasteaux islands and around Merauke in West Papua. It is hunted
by many coastal people, an activity no doubt contributing to its somewhat erratic distribution.
Flannery (1995a:82) mentions several reports of a large wallaby, possibly _Macropus agilis_, from southern
New Ireland, which he has so far been unable to verify. The fourth genus,
_Thylogale_, is the small scrub wallaby or pademelon. Its range includes the lowlands of
northern New Guinea as far west as Jayapura, the hills round Port Moresby, the Huon Peninsula,
New Britain and New Ireland. Bali-Vitu, spoken off the north-west coast of New Britain, has
a term for wallaby. Lapita sites in the Arawe Islands, off the south-west coast of New Britain,
have yielded bones of _Thylogale browni_ as well as the cuscus _Phalanger orientalis_ and the
flightless cassowary, all introduced species.

    One wallaby species is found on the islands west of the Bird’s Head, and others on Aru
and on Kei. No wallabies are present in the Solomons or the Admiralties group. Although
wallabies are now absent from the St Matthias group, bones of wallabies and a cuscus
(_Spilocuscus maculatus_) have been recovered from Lapita middens excavated from the low flat
coral island of Eloaue south-east of the high island of Mussau (Green 1979:37). Flannery and
White state that the northern pademelon, _Thylogale browni_, was introduced into New Ireland
some 7000 years ago, and that animals were possibly carried from there to the St Matthias
group, although the species never became established there (Flannery 1995a:83).

    The general pattern seems to be that different species adapt to particular areas, and are
restricted to those areas. Although it may happen that two or three species are found within
the territory familiar to a single language community, sources for each language usually give
only one term for wallaby and it is likely that this is the generic.

    A PWOc term for wallaby, _*wakin_, is well supported, with reflexes in North New Guinea,
Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian languages. If terms in two non-Oceanic languages spoken
on the West Papuan coast are cognate, then _*wakin_ is reconstructable to PEMP and POc. The
non-Oceanic terms, from Smits and Voorhoeve (1992:241), are glossed ‘kangaroo’, but the
reference must be to small macropod species, popularly known as wallabies, as the larger
species known as kangaroos are absent from New Guinea.

   Several additional Papuan Tip terms support a PPT reconstruction _*wagita_ ‘wallaby’

    Agreements between NNG and PT languages point to a PNGOc term, _*makan_. Reflexes
in PT languages predictably add a final _-i_. Retention of final _*n_ plus the added vowel is
unexpected in Motu and Magori, and suggests borrowing from a SE Papuan source, perhaps
a dialect of Suau. At least two Central Papuan languages use reflexes of _*makan_ ‘wallaby’
as a generic for ‘fish’. Ross (1994a: 422) uses the example of the two Sinaugoro dialects, one
inland (Taboro), the other coastal (Balawaia), to suggest that the term was in some places
generalised to cover protein food, and then restricted in some coastal languages to the main
protein food available, namely fish.

5.2.2.2 Tree kangaroos (Genus _Dendrolagus_)

224   Meredith Osmond and Andrew Pawley

Within the Oceanic region, tree kangaroos (genus _Dendrolagus_) are restricted to mainland
New Guinea and some close offshore islands. There are about eight species in the region.
_Dendrolagus inustus_, the grizzled tree kangaroo, is found in a wide band across northern New Guinea
from the Bird’s Head Peninsula to the Torricelli Mountains. _Dendrolagus scottae_, Scott’s tree
kangaroo, occurs in lowlands forests in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea. The other
species have distributions that make them less likely to be known to speakers of Oceanic
languages. _Dendrolagus matschiei_, the Huon tree kangaroo, with chestnut-red pelage and long yellow
tail, is restricted to the heavily forested mountains of the Huon Peninsula. _Dendrolagus dorianus_. Doria’s
tree kangaroo, is a large brownish-black animal that lives in the cloud and moss forests of
montane New Guinea. _Dendrolagus goodfellowi_ and the closely related _Dendrolagus pulcherrimus_, the smallest
species, are found in mid montane zones, _D. stellarum_ in the highlands of west-central New
Guinea, _Dendrolagus spadix_, in the south-western lowlands of Papua New Guinea and
_D. mbaiso_ in the highlands of west-central New Guinea.

     To date, tree kangaroos are known outside the New Guinea mainland only on Umboi
(presumably carried by humans from the nearby Huon Gulf area), Yapen and Salawati and
Cape York, Australia (Van Deusen 1972:713, Flannery 1995a: 126-143). There is no record of
their existence in the Admiralties or the Solomons, although we have a term for tree kangaroo
from Sursurunga, New Ireland, and another from Kaulong, New Britain, presumably because
people there are aware that they exist elsewhere.

     Fewer than twenty terms for _Dendrolagus_ have been collected in total, all bar one from
North New Guinea, the odd one out being Meso-Melanesian: Sursurunga _atal_ ‘wallaby, includes
Matschie’s tree kangaroo’. Of the NNG terms, one is from New Britain (Kaulong _elan_
‘possum, also tree wallaby’), two are from a Schouten Chain language on the north coast
(Sissano _nep_ and _ʔapar_, both apparently meaning ‘tree kangaroo’) and one is from Bing, a Vitiaz
Strait language north of the Huon Peninsula (_dagyiebiy_ ‘tree kangaroo’). The remainder are
from Huon Peninsula languages. No reconstructions are possible from these data other than
a single low level term, Proto Buang _*kekuŋ_.


5.2.3 Cuscuses (Phalangeridae)

The phalangerids include the cuscuses of the New Guinea region and the brushtail possums of
Australia. They are large arboreal herbivores. Several species of cuscus are present in
mainland New Guinea and in the D’Entrecasteaux, Louisiade and Trobriand Islands. Phalangers
are common in the islands immediately to the west and southwest of New Guinea, including
Sulawesi, Timor, Ambon, Seram, Burn and Kei. Groves (1984) notes that Ambon and Seram
have a distinct variety of _Phalanger orientalis_, and concludes that it got there without human
intervention.

    In prehistoric times certain species were translocated by humans to Island Melanesia and
the Moluccas. New Britain, New Ireland and the Solomons each have an introduced species.
_Phalanger orientalis_, the northern common cuscus (aka grey cuscus) is an abundant lowland
species native to New Guinea that about 20,000 years ago was taken to New Ireland, where
it became an important prey species (Leavesley 2005). It was introduced to the Solomon
Islands and also to Timor at some time in the last 7,000 years (Flannery and Wickler 1990,
Glover 1986). A single species, _Spilocuscus maculatus_, is found in the Admiralties, including
Manus, Wuvulu and Ninigo. It is commonly hunted on Manus.

    There is a well supported POc reconstruction for ‘cuscus’, _*(k,kʷ)adroRa_. For a number of
languages, sources give the gloss ‘possum’ to its reflexes (‘possum’ is often used loosely in
Australian English to refer to any member of the superfamily Phalangeroidea), but this can
only refer to a phalanger.

    The following Southeast Solomonic terms reflect _*kadora_, with _-r-_ for expected _-l-_. This
is consistent with borrowing from Meso-Melanesian neighbours in the western Solomons.

    A second reconstruction is more weakly supported. It is well represented in the
Cristobal-Malaitan branch of SE Solomonic but otherwise is reflected only in Gela, where the reflex
refers to a juvenile cuscus, and in one Papuan Tip language.

5.2.4 Other possum families (Acrobatidae, Burramyidae, Petauridae, Pseudocheiridae)

Besides the cuscuses, four other families within the super-family Phalangeroidea are
represented in New Guinea. They include little feather-tailed possums (Acrobatidae), pygmy
possums (Burramyidae), sugar gliders, striped possums and long-fingered striped trioks (all
Petauridae) and ringtail possums (Pseudocheiridae). The Acrobatidae and Burramyidae are
restricted to the Australian-New Guinea land mass. Sugar gliders are also found in the
D’Entrecasteaux, Louisiade and Trobriand Islands and New Britain, and outside the Oceanic region
on Halmahera, Kei and Aru. They are absent from New Ireland, the Solomons and the Admiralties.
The Pseudocheiridae are poor dispersers who prefer montane forests, and are confined
to New Guinea and a few of the larger islands off the coast of western New Guinea. A PNGOc
term for ‘sugar glider’ is supported by probable cognates shared by several Papuan
Tip languages and at least one North New Guinea language. However, reflexes show a number of
irregularities, and it is necessary to reconstruct doublets.

5.2.5 Bandicoots (Peroryctidae)

New Guinea is home to several genera of the family Peroryctidae, the bandicoots. They include
_Echymipera_ (common or spiny bandicoot, long-nosed bandicoot), _Peroryctes_ (giant
bandicoot, Raffray’s bandicoot), and _Microperoryctes_ (mouse bandicoot, striped bandicoot).
The mouse bandicoot is found only in the west of West Papua but the other genera are
distributed widely on mainland New Guinea. Bandicoots are not present in the Solomons.
Spriggs (1997a: 54) writes that at Pamwak, in Manus, bandicoots appear suddenly in the
archaeological record at about 13,000 BP and quickly become dominant in the faunal record.
This suggests human introduction. To the west of New Guinea, outside the region occupied
by speakers of Oceanic languages, bandicoot species are present on Seram, Yapen, Waigeo,
Kei and Aru. Compilers of wordlists are often unfamiliar with bandicoots, describing them
as ‘large bush rats’, ‘marsupial rats’ or similar.

    A POc term for ‘bandicoot’, _*mʷajar_, is well supported. There are reflexes in the
Admiralties, North New Guinea, Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian subgroups referring to the
bandicoot, and probable reflexes in Ponapean and certain Fijian dialects with change of
referent. External cognates are found in several CEMP languages of the Moluccas and islands
to the south of the Bird’s Head of New Guinea, where the reference is often to cuscus rather
than bandicoot.

5.2.6 Marsupial carnivores (Dasyuridae)

The Dasyuridae are a family of carnivorous and insectivorous marsupial rodents, including
various antechinus species and quolls and, most famously, the Tasmanian devil. Five genera
of dasyurids are unique to New Guinea and three genera are common to New Guinea and
Australia. Most dasyurids are small, weighing between 100-500 grams, although quolls of the
New Guinea rainforest may exceed half a kilogram in weight (Flannery 1995: 83). Dasyurids
may be either diurnal or nocturnal, and some antechinus species are partly arboreal. Many
species are found in rainforest, often at middle to high altitudes. Few members of the family
have been recorded from coastal Austronesian-speaking areas, although one antechinus is
found on Normanby in the D’Entrecasteaux Group, and other dasyurids have been recorded
from the Aru Islands. Flannery (1995:84) comments that quolls will enter villages to catch
rats, and are respected as fierce predators by most New Guineans familiar with them, who
show great caution when handling them.

    No Oceanic terms for dasyurids have been recorded. It is likely that compilers of wordlists
have generally not been familiar with dasyurids as such, and in some cases have referred to
them by a term such as ‘small marsupial rodent’.


5.2.7 Echidnas (Tachyglossidae)

Monotremes are represented in New Guinea by two genera of echidna: _Tachyglossus_ (short-beaked
echidna) and _Zaglossus_ (long-beaked echidna). Both are regarded as rare.
Flannery (1995: 67) suggests that hunting pressure has severely reduced their numbers. Very little is
known about the distribution and natural history of _Tachyglossus_, but it has been recorded
in the Markham valley and around Port Moresby, and from the island of Salawati off the
Bird’s Head. _Zaglossus_ has also been reported from both the western and eastern extremities
of New Guinea, but is found only where population densities are low. A term for the echidna
is present in only two languages in our sample (Sinaugoro _modagini_ ‘anteater’ (cf. _moda_
‘bandicoot’) and Motu _miɣu_ ‘short-beaked echidna’) and no reconstructions are possible.


5.2.8 Rats (Muridae)

Rats were a significant source of protein for many Oceanic communities in prehistoric times.
The diversity of rat species diminishes sharply as one moves from New Guinea to the Bismarcks
and Solomons. In New Guinea the murid fauna is ‘abundant and diverse, and for
the size of the land mass, one of the most species-rich found anywhere on earth’
(Flannery 1995: 231). There are some 27 genera there, including Hydromys, Leptomys, Mallomys,
Melomys, Pogonomys, Uromys, Rattus and Stenomys, although only a subset of these are
present in any one region. Most New Guinea area species are endemic.

    Nine murid species are endemic to the Solomons, including two that are extinct. Three
species of Solomys and one of Uromys have evolved into large or very large arboreal rats,
which are probably the evolutionary counterparts of the possums of Sahul. However, single
islands in the Solomons seldom have more than two or three species. No rat species were
present in Remote Oceania before the advent of humans.

Figure 5.5: _Rattus exulans_, rat


    Five commensal rat species have been introduced to Oceania: _Rattus rattus_, _Rattus exulans_,
_Rattus tanezumi_, _Rattus norvegicus_ and _Mus musculus_. _Rattus rattus_, the black rat, and _Mus musculus_,
the mouse were introduced into the Pacific within the past few centuries by European voyagers.
The other three species were carried to Oceania in prehistoric times. _Rattus exulans_, the Pacific rat,
is a commensal animal whose original range was in Asia, probably from Bangladesh
to Vietnam (Groves 1984). It was carried to Oceania by humans several millenia ago and today
is found widely in Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. _Rattus exulans_ has in recent years
come to play an important role in tracing the directions of early human settlement of Oceania,
especially Remote Oceania. Because it is an introduced animal and because it is common
in archaeological sites, it provides sufficient prehistoric and contemporary populations for
reliable genetic analysis (Matisoo-Smith and Robins 2004, Matisoo-Smith 2007). _Rattus rattus_
occurs in Lapita sites from the Bismarcks to western Polynesia and was clearly associated
with the initial Lapita dispersal into Remote Oceania. It was the only one of the commensal
rats to reach Polynesia in ancient times.

    _Rattus praetor_, the spiny rat, considerably larger than exulans, is native to New Guinea,
where it is widespread north and south of the central ranges as far east as the Sepik-Ramu
basin. It also occurs on offshore islands in the Bismarck Archipelago where it appears in
archaeological assemblages dated to at least 13,000 years ago (White, Clark and Bedford 2000)
and in the Solomon Islands, where its introduction is probably of similar antiquity.
_Rattus praetor_ is now extinct in Remote Oceania but occurs in archaeological sites in Vanuatu and
Fiji, though not in Polynesia or Micronesia.

    A third commensal species, _Rattus tanezumi_, the Asian house rat, has a narrow distribution
in Oceania, being securely attested only in archaeological sites in the Caroline Islands
and the northern Marianas, dated to within the last 1,000 years. _Rattus tanezumi_ is native to South
Asia and Southeast Asia and its Oceanic distribution is consistent with transport direct from
Island Southeast Asia to the Carolines, rather than via Melanesia.

    Sources for Oceanic language seldom give precise identifications for rat terms. Glosses
tend to be of the order of ‘bush rat’ or simply ‘kind of rat’, glosses which fail to capture
genuine taxa in the language. One investigator (Futscher 1959) recorded at least 10 terms for
kinds of rat in Tolai but the glosses simply say ‘mouse’.

    POc _*kasupe_, continuing PEMP _*kanzupay_, has reflexes applied to one or more species of
the genus _Rattus_, rats living in and around human settlements. Reflexes in Cristobal-Malaitan
and Vanuatu languages preserve initial syllable _*-a-_. Those in Western Oceanic and Guadalcanal
languages and in Western Fijian show initial _u-_. These may represent several independent cases
where the first vowel assimilated to the following _u_. However, the assimilation is
so widespread it is reasonable to reconstruct a POc doublet, _*kusupe_.

[3] The Bali term reflects POc †_*kusupeq_. On non-Oceanic evidence _*-q_ was not present in the POc form, and
 the Bali reflex is a mystery.

   Reflexes of the root PAn _*-labaw_ ‘rat’ occur alone or in combination with a preposed
CV-formative in various daughter languages, yielding a number of related terms including PAn
_*kulabaw_ and PMP _*balabaw_ (Blust 2002:107).

   As an independent form _*labaw_ is traceable back to PMP, with Oceanic reflexes from the
Te Motu group and, less certainly, the Malakula languages of Vanuatu.

    The latter forms exhibit a final _-t_ which is unexpected in comparison with PMP _*labaw_.
Tagbanawa (Kalamian), a Philippines language, has a similar word _laput_ ‘rat’ but this is likely
to be an accidental resemblance.

    PMP _*bualabaw_ has probable Oceanic reflexes in Admiralty and NNG languages. The
expected POc form is _*bʷalapo_ or _*pʷalapo_, and Bing _palāf_ supports the latter. However,
the final vowels of the Admiralties forms are unexplained. The Titan and Aua forms also
show irregular loss of _*-p-_.

    PAn _*kulabaw_ ‘rat, mouse’, with reflexes in Taiwan (Paiwan _kulavaw_ ‘mouse, rat’, Rukai

5.2.9 Bats (Order: Chiroptera, Suborders Megachiroptera, Microchiroptera)

Bats form a very large order consisting of two suborders and at least six families (Flannery 1995).
The Megachiroptera include the fruit-sucking bats (flying foxes and fruit bats) and
bats which feed on nectar and pollen. Figure 5.6 shows the greater bare-backed fruit bat,
_Dobsonia moluccensis_ (aka _D. mapna_). This species and others of the genus Dobsonia are
widespread in New Guinea and Island Melanesia, as far east as the Solomons, as are other
members of the family Pteropodidae (fruit-bats). The Microchiroptera include tube-nosed
bats, sheathtail bats, horseshoe bats and leaf-nosed bats, typically insectivorous, although at
least one genus preys on small fish (Flannery 1995: 455). Several species of Microchiroptera
are recently described, and revision of the genera is ongoing.

    Reflexes of PMP _*paniki_ ‘fruit bat, flying fox, _Pteropns_ spp. ’ occur in the Philippines and
Indonesia, but have not been located in Oceanic languages. POc _*bʷeka_ is a well supported
reconstruction. It has reflexes denoting ‘fruit bat’ in most major subgroups of Oceanic, an
exception being Papuan Tip. In NCV languages _*bʷeka_ is generally lost but in a few languages
the form is continued as the name for the barn owl, Tyto alba. For North New Guinea
reflexes see under _*mali-bʷeka_ below.

    A few Admiralties and North New Guinea languages reflect a complex form _*mali-bʷeka_.
The etymology of _*mali-_ is uncertain but it is most likely a modification of POc _*manuk_ ‘bird,
bat’.

    In many Oceanic languages small insectivorous bats (Microchiroptera) have a separate
name from fruit bats. It is uncertain whether this was also the case in POc. In parts of Polynesia
reflexes of _*peka-peka_ are given both to a small bat and to a swift whose behaviour, form and
habitat resemble superficially that of insectivorous, cave-dwelling bats. The Fijian languages
have cognate reduplicated forms referring only to small cave bats. Reduplication is commonly
used to show diminutives in some Oceanic languages (see also vol.3, pp.50-51).

5.3 Introduced terrestrial mammals

5.3.1 Pigs (genus _Sus_, family Suidae)

Island Southeast Asia is the centre of genetic diversity of the genus _Sus_, containing six of
the 10 generally recognised species: _S. verrucosus_ (the Javan warty pig), _S. barbatus_ (the
bearded pig of Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo with a subspecies in Palawan), _S. celebensis_
(the Sulawesi warty pig), _S. cebifrons_ (the Visayan warty pig), _S. philippensis_ (the Philippines
warty pig) and _Sus scrofa_ (the common wild pig, endemic to Europe, North Africa, parts of
Asia and parts of the Indo-Malaysian archipelago). No pig species is native to New Guinea
or any part of Oceania.

     Most pig species have never been domesticated. The most important exception is _Sus scrofa_,
which was domesticated in the Middle East and in China around 10,000 years ago and
subsequently introduced to many regions. A wild variety of this species, _Sus scrofa_ vittatus,
the banded pig, inhabits Sundaland from the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra, Java and Bali.
It is also present east of Wallace’s Line on Sumbawa and Lombok, possibly due to human
transportation.

     Sus celebensis occurs domesticated only in Timor and Roti. Groves (1984) argues that its
natural range is Sulawesi and offshore islands, and that its presence on Timor, Roti, Flores,
Halmahera (and even more surprisingly, on Simalue, west of Sumatra) is the result of human
agency. A similar conclusion, based on genetic evidence, is drawn by Larson et al. (2007).
Groves (1984:3) suggests that the wild and domestic pigs of New Guinea are a cross between
the banded pig and the Sulawesi warty pig.

     Pigs, domesticated and wild, appear to have been part of the Austronesian world since
PAn times. A number of terms associated with pigs and pig husbandry can be reconstructed
for PAn and PMP. In his Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (1995), Blust writes that

238   Meredith Osmond and Andrew Pawley


|       Although PAn _*beRek_ evidently meant ‘domesticated pig’ PAn _*babuy_ referred to pigs
|       in general, with qualifications where needed.[4] In other words, the glosses of _*babuy_ and
|       _*beRek_ were not perfectly complementary, but partially overlapping …. Reflexes of both
|       _*babuy_ and _*beRek_ are found in Formosan and WMP, but only _*babuy_ is reflected in
|       CMP and only _*beRek_ in Oceanic.

[4] PAn _*babuy_ ‘pig (generic)'. PMP _*babuy banua_ ‘domesticated pig’. PMP _*babuy halas_ ‘wild pig’, PMP
 _*babuy lebu_ ‘domesticated pig’. PAn _*babity-an_ ‘pigpen, pigsty, piggery’ (ACD).

The history of the introduction of pigs into Oceania has been a matter of debate. Pig bones
occur in early Lapita sites from the Bismarck Archipelago to the Reef Is. in the period
 3300-3100 BP. A recent genetic study supports the view that although Lapita pigs reached
Melanesia via Indonesia they ultimately stem from Vietnam or nearby parts of mainland
Southeast Asia, rather than from Taiwan (Larson et al. 2007), but domestic pig bones dated
to 4000 BP have been found in cultural deposits in the Philippines (Piper et al. 2009). Some
archaeologists argue that the wild pigs of New Guinea are feral descendants of Lapita pigs.
Others hold that pig teeth are present in New Guinea highland assemblages predating Lapita,
although it has proved difficult to securely date these finds.

    POc _*boRok_ is continued in all the major subgroups of Near Oceania and in parts of
Remote Oceania as far east as western Fiji. However, no reflexes are found in New Caledonia
and the Loyalty Is., where pigs have been absent since initial settlement by Lapita peoples,
or in eastern Fiji and Polynesia.

    Reflexes of _*boRok_ in many Solomons languages are irregular. Irregular loss of _*R_ is
exhibited in this term in most Cristobal-Malaitan languages, e.g. Longgu _bo_, Sa’a _pō_, Santa
Ana _bʷō_, some Guadalcanal languages, e.g. Ghari _bo_, and many NW Solomonic languages,
e.g. Roviana _boko_. North Malaitan languages show unexpected _s_ as the medial consonant, as
in Fataleka _boso_, suggesting borrowing from Santa Isabel languages, which typically show
the same replacement.

    POc _*boRok_ is not retained in Polynesian languages, being replaced by PPn _*puaka_. This
appears to continue POc _*b(o,u)kas(i)_, which has reflexes in PT, NCV and SV. Reflexes of

5.3.2 Dogs (_Canis_ sp.)

Dogs were brought by humans to Island Southeast Asia, Oceania and Australia from mainland
SE Asia within the last few millennia. The pre-European dogs of Oceania and Australia did
not bark, but rather howled.

     PAn and PMP _*asu_ ‘dog’ is reflected in many languages of Taiwan, the Philippines,
western Indonesia, the Lesser Sundas and much of the southern and central Moluccas, but to date
is unattested in any Eastern Malayo-Polynesian language. As others (Hudson 1989, Lynch 1991,
Donohue 1995) have discovered, names for ‘dog’ are notoriously variable in Oceanic
languages. This variability is consonant with a hypothesis, first suggested by Andrew Sharp (1956),
that on small remote islands in Oceania the dog lost much of the economic value
it had in insular Southeast Asia, became a competitor for food, and was itself eaten to
extinction in many locations and then reacquired from areas where it had managed to survive.
Lynch (1991:427) suggests that the Polynesians reintroduced the dog to various parts of
Island Melanesia in their back-migrations from the Polynesian Triangle, with variants of
Polynesian terms for ‘dog’ appearing in Vanuatu, the Reefs and parts of the Solomons. Various
Micronesian languages also appear to have borrowed from Polynesia.

     It is unclear whether or not POc speakers had dogs. No dog remains have been found in
early Western Lapita sites in the Bismarck archipelago. The earliest dog remains associated
with the Oceanic dispersal are those found in late or post-Lapita assemblages in the Reef Is.,
dated to around 2600 BP (R. Green pers. comm.). No POc term for dog can be reconstructed
with any confidence. A number of languages of Bougainville reflect a term reconstructable
as _*kasi_, but we hesitate to associate this term with PAn _*asu_ because the initial _*k-_ is
unexplained.[5]

[5] Blust (ACD) does note Ifugao _kahu_ ‘dog’ from the northern Philippines, and Tontemboan _ka-asu_ ‘canine companion’
from northern Sulawesi, but both languages have corresponding _asu_ terms (Ifugao _ahú_ ‘dog, hound’,
 Tontemboan _asu_ ‘dog; also used of domesticated animals in general’). The _k-_ initial terms are
 considered unrelated to the Oceanic ones.

    Donohue (1995:226) has identified forms resembling _*kapuna_ that are present in Western
Oceanic languages and in various languages of eastern Indonesia, both Austronesian and
non-Austronesian. The Austronesian languages include Sangir _kapuna_ (Sangiric, WMP), Geser
_kafuna_ (Seram, CMP) and Mor _auna_ (WNG). He argues that ‘this (the presence of this term
in eastern Indonesia), and the patterned distribution of the reflexes of _*kapuna_ in Oceania
point to an origin of the form in eastern Indonesia with spread to Oceania, and not the other
way round.’

    Compare also the following which point to a very similar form in PNNG _*gavun_:[6]

  NNG:   Gedaged      gaun
>

    The following series offers some support for reconstructing PWOc _*ka(u,w)ak_, but there
is probably onomatopoeic influence.

[6] Blust (2002:92) considers that the only serious candidate for a POc term for ‘dog’ is _*gaun_, which ‘is evidently
 onomatopoeic, and possibly a convergent innovation’. As reflexes of _*gaun_ we assume he had in mind some
 of the forms assigned here to _*kapuna_, _*gavun_ and possibly _*kawak(a)_.

    PPn _*kuli_ ‘dog’ is well-attested but has no secure non-Polynesian cognates. All apparent
cognates in languages of Melanesia and Micronesia are almost certainly borrowings from
Polynesian sources. A sample of such borrowed forms, all glossed ‘dog’, is listed below.

that there were no dogs on Banks Islands at first contact.

5.4 Aquatic mammals

The aquatic mammals of tropical Oceania consist of various cetaceans (whales and dolphins)
and the dugong. In Oceanic languages these animals are often classified as kinds of fish (POc
_*ikan_, cf ch.8, §2).


5.4.1 Cetaceans

5.4.1.1 Whales

POc speakers probably occasionally sighted certain species of whales. Few surveys appear
to have been done of whale populations in Melanesia but sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus,
and a number of smaller whales, in particular pilot whales, Globicephala melaena,
and orcas or killer whales, Orcinus orca, have been reported in New Guinea waters. Pilot
whales are more visible, being highly gregarious and occurring in large schools. Large numbers
of pilot whales have been reported in Astrolabe Bay, while orcas have been sighted in
Kimbe Bay off the north coast of New Britain (website reportings, 2003). Whales were not
hunted by Oceanic communities in pre-contact times but when strandings occurred communities
made use of the meat and teeth.

    Reflexes of _*rato_ ‘whale’ are well represented in Micronesian languages. Elsewhere
probable reflexes are known only in Nyindrou and Wuvulu in the Admiralties. Borrowing
cannot be ruled out.

  Mic:    Ponapean    rac̣
>

    There is a widespread tendency in Oceanic languages to refer to whales by terms that
otherwise describe the action of blowing something out or spraying or spurting, e.g. Teop _kavuhu_
‘to spray’, _kavu-kavuhu_ ‘whale’. POc _*puRa-puRas_ ‘whale’, which is attested in NNG, PT
and SES, is evidently an extension of _*puRas_ ‘spray water from the mouth’. It has as
antecedents PAn _*buReS_, PMP _*buRah_ ‘spray water from the mouth’ (ACD).

5.4.1.2 Dolphins (Delphinidae)

Several species of dolphins, including Tursiops truncatus, the bottlenose dolphin,
Stenella longirostris, the spinner dolphin and Grampus griseus, Risso’s dolphin, are found in Oceania
(Dawbin 1972: 270-276). Wordlists and dictionaries of Oceanic languages give only generic
terms for ‘dolphin’. The synonym ‘porpoise’ is commonly used in glosses.

    POc _*ku[r,R]iap_, with final _*-ap_, is indicated by reflexes in North New Guinea, Papuan
Tip and Meso-Melanesian languages and by _kulef_ ‘dolphin’ in an external witness, Sawei, an
Eastern Malayo-Polynesian language of South Halmahera. Southeast Solomonic and Vanuatu
reflexes point to PEOc _*giRio(p)_. Admiralties and SES languages reflect medial _*-r-_, while
reflexes from NCV indicate _*-R-_. Other reflexes are compatible with either.

[7] Clark (2009) reconstructs PNCV _*gu(R)io_, but two Torres languages, Hiw and Lo-Toga. support inclusion of
 _*-R-_ (François 2011b).

[8] PMic _*kua_ is likely to be a continuation of POc _*kuRiap_. _*R_ is usually lost in Micronesian languages. Loss
 of _*R_ would have yielded _*kuia_, and the reduction to _*kuya_ and then _*kua_ would follow a natural path.

[9] John Lynch (pers. comm.) notes that both the SV forms appear to continue _*kuriap_, albeit with an additional
 initial and final syllable.

5.4.2 Dugong (_Dugong dugon_)

Dugongs are large aquatic mammals, with paddle-like forelimbs, no hindlimbs and a fluked,
dolphin-like tail. They graze on beds of seagrass and are found in shallow coastal waters
throughout the Indo-Malaysian archipelago, New Guinea and nearby islands including the
Admiralties and Bismarcks, and in the Solomons, Vanuatu and New Caledonia, but not in
Fiji or places further east (Chambers et al. 1989:1). Dugongs are prized by Pacific Islanders
for their flesh, oil and small ivory tusks. Spears and nets are the main methods of capture. In
the Trobriands and Manus very strong nets made from pandanus leaves are used while in the
Siassi islands nets are made from the bark of a tree (Pyne 1972:276).

    There is a well attested PMP etymon, _*duyuŋ_ ‘dugong’. While most Oceanic reflexes
point to _*rui_, evidence that POc continued PMP _*duyuŋ_ as _*ruyuŋ_ survives in the Tiang
(New Ireland) reflex, which preserves the final velar nasal, and in Marovo (New Georgia),
which retains a nasal, though this is _m_ for expected _*-ŋ_.

    No reflexes of POc _*ruyuŋ_ have been found in Eastern Oceanic languages. For Proto
Southeast Solomonic, _*paipu_ ‘dugong’ can be reconstructed. For Proto North Central Vanuatu
_*boe-ni-tasi_ ‘dolphin’ (literally ‘pig of the sea’) has been reconstructed by Clark (2009).


5.5 Reptiles

5.5.1 Marine turtles (Chelonidae)

At least four large species of marine turtles are common to the Oceanic region: the hawksbill
(Eretmochelys imbricatd), with its beak-like mouth, the green turtle (_Chelonia mydas_), with
brown or black carapace, the loggerhead (_Caretta caretta_), with its very large head, and the
leatherback (_Dermochelys coriacea_), distinguished from other turtles by its lack of a bony
shell, its carapace being covered by thick leathery skin. The much smaller olive fidley (Lep-
idochelys olivacea) spends almost all of its time in the open ocean and is less familiar to
Pacific Islanders. Turtles are prized by Oceanic communities for their flesh and fat and (in
the case of the hawksbill) for their shells.

    As well as having a generic for ‘turtle’, a number of languages have distinct names for all
four species and some distinguish male and female turtles, as the following examples show.

    The shell of the hawksbill turtle is prized, being used to make ornaments like earrings
and bracelets as well as bonito hook tips and cutting tools. In Tonga and E. Futuna this turtle
is called _fonu koloa_, in Tikopia _fonu koroa_, the term for ‘property, treasure’ being used to
identify the turtle with valuable shell.

    A term for the hawksbill turtle, _*keRaŋ_ is well supported. In Oceanic languages, the
beaked profile of the hawksbill turtle is identified with that of a parrot rather than a hawk.
In Lou (Admiralties), the same term refers to both the turtle and a red parrot. In Maori the
term survives only for the parrot. (For discussion of the atypical /e/ vowel, see Blust 1983-84:8-10).
All the Admiralties terms have problematic reflexes of _*R_ and all show vowel
metathesis.

   The green turtle is the most abundant and widespread turtle of tropical Oceania and the
one most valued for food. It may weigh up to 200 kg, with carapace length around 150 cm.
A POc term is reconstructable but reflexes have been found only in a few North New Guinea
and Micronesian languages.

    The leatherback turtle, _Dermochelys coriacea_, is the largest turtle in the world with an
average carapace length of two metres and average weight of around 360 kg. It nests widely
along the north coast of New Guinea, Manus, New Britain and Bougainville, but always in
very low densities. It is generally not favoured for eating because of its very oily and smelly
meat (Mueller 1985:195). No widespread cognate set has been found.


5.5.2 Crocodiles (Crocodylidae)

The archaeologist Simon Best has published a comprehensive review of the distribution of
crocodiles in the Pacific (Best 1988). Two species occur in Melanesia: _Crocodylus porosus_,
the estuarine or saltwater crocodile and _Crocodylus novaeguineae_. The latter is found in freshwater
swamps and lakes in lowland New Guinea. The normal (breeding) range of _Crocodylus porosus_ extends
from south-west India to the Solomons, and from the Tropic of Capricorn in Australia
to the Philippines. The easternmost limit for breeding populations is the Santa Cruz group.
Individual animals are capable of very long journeys, over 1000 km, and have been reliably
recorded in northern Vanuatu, Fiji and Kiribati, but these occasional occurrences do not
represent an extension of their breeding range.

[10] The only reflex in a Formosan language is Puyuma _buaya_ ‘shark’. Blust (ACD) writes that there are at least
three pieces of evidence that _*buqaya_ meant ‘crocodile’ not only in PMP, but also in PAn, in spite of the fact
that the Formosan Puyuma reflex is glossed ‘shark’. These are (1) that a general term for shark, PAn _*qiSu_, is
already available, (2) outside Taiwan reflexes of _*buqaya_ invariably carry the primary sense ‘crocodile’, (3)
crocodiles were earlier present in at least the southern portion of Taiwan, but disappeared before the historical
period. Under these circumstances the application of the name of a dangerous reptilian aquatic predator to its
functional equivalent in the world of fishes is not surprising.

Figure 5.10: _Crocodylus porosus_, saltwater crocodile

    POc _*puqaya_ ‘crocodile’ continues PMP _*buqaya_ and, probably, PAn _*buqaya_.[10] Reflexes of
_*puqaya_ are found widely in languages of the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea
and the main Solomons group, i.e. where crocodiles are common, and are also present in a
few languages of Vanuatu. No reflexes have been recorded in Micronesian or Central Pacific
languages.

5.5.3 Lizards

5.5.3.1 Introduction

Lizards are discussed here under the following headings: monitors (§5.3.2), iguanas (§5.3.3),
geckos (§5.3.4), skinks (§5.3.5) and indeterminate (§5.3.6), but there is frequent transfer of
name within cognate sets from one family to another. Monitor lizards and iguanas belong
to different families, although these names are used interchangeably in some wordlists. The
Australian goanna belongs with the monitor lizards of Indonesia, New Guinea and the western
Pacific. The iguana is of South American origin, and is found in the Pacific today only in the
Galapagos Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna. In many sources the gloss ‘iguana’ is
incorrectly applied to monitor lizards.


5.5.3.2 Monitors (Varanidae)

Nearly a score of different species of monitors are to be found in the Indo-Pacific region. The
best known, because of its great size, is the komodo monitor, a species confined to the Lesser
Sundas. The most widespread species in Oceania is _Varanus indicus_, a water monitor, valued
as an important food source. Its range extends from Sulawesi through to the Aru and Kei
Islands, the New Guinea land mass including the Schouten Islands, the D’Entrecasteaux and
Trobriand Islands, New Britain, New Ireland, the Admiralties, the Solomons and northwards
to the Carolines, Marianas and Marshalls (Loveridge 1946:60-64, de Rooij 1970:149). Water
monitors can grow to over two metres in length, with the tail about one and a half times as
long as the head and body. They are excellent swimmers, and have been seen swimming far
out to sea.

254 Meredith Osmond and Andrew Pawley

    De Rooij lists five other Varanus species in New Guinea (_V. salvadorii_, _V. kalabeck_,
V. gouldi, V prasinus, V kordensis), but none are found outside the main island except for the
last-named which is found also on Aru. The fact that Arosi has two terms for monitor lizard
(incorrectly glossed ‘iguana’ by Fox), _haha_, ‘the larger’, _ʔaraʔu_, ‘the smaller’, may indicate
sub-species or a distinction based on sex or age. The skin of the larger monitors is used in
New Guinea to cover the end of hourglass drums. The POc term _*ka(r,l)(i,u)pa(s)_ probably
referred to large monitor lizards.

5.5.3.3 Iguanas (Iguanidae)

True iguanas, in contrast to monitor lizards, would not have been known to speakers of POc.
Iguanas (_Brachylophus_ spp.) are present in the Oceanic region only in Fiji, Tonga, Wallis
and Futuna. They are of South American origin and probably arrived in the central Pacific
on floating vegetation. They are diurnal and strongly arboreal in behaviour. A Proto Central
Pacific name for ‘iguana’, _*vokai_, is reconstructable from cognates in Fijian and Polynesian
languages. No non-CP cognates have been recorded. In Rennellese the reflex of _*vokai_
is applied to monitor lizards. The Tongan term identified in the dictionary as ‘chameleon’
probably refers to a lizard with chameleon-like ability to change colour; true chameleons are
natives of Africa. Paddy Ryan reports that _Brachylophus vitiensis_, the crested iguana, has the
ability to change colour when frightened or angry and will turn a very dark green, almost
black, within five minutes (Ryan 1988:106).

5.5.3.4 Geckos (Gekkonidae)

Figure 5.12: _Hemidactylus frenatus_, common house gecko

Geckos are widely distributed across mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesia and the tropical
Pacific. They are one of the few reptiles with voices; they make small chirruping noises.
They are mostly nocturnal, and many species frequent buildings, although others are forest
dwellers. Most are less than 15cm long, and, in common with skinks, have the ability to
discard their tails when threatened. They are generally welcomed by households, both for
their efforts in keeping down moths, mosquitos, cockroaches and other household pests, and
because they are widely regarded as good omens (Loveridge 1946:73).

    A number of Western Malayo-Polynesian terms for gecko are onomatopoeic, typically
reflexes of PMP _*tektek_. Although there are numerous gecko species throughout the Oceanic
region, only one term which might be considered a reflex of PMP _*tektek_ has been noted.

    We have reconstructed POc _*bili_ ‘k.o. lizard’, which may be an irregular reflex of a PAn
term, _*bulilik_ ‘lizard sp.’ (Blust 2002), but on present evidence the connection is uncertain.
Its reflexes in Polynesian languages carry two meanings, ‘gecko’ (or sometimes ‘lizard
(generic)’) and ‘adhere to’, pointing to a lizard name that reflects its character.

    Some of the Polynesian reflexes may be compounded with the generic term for lizard,
PPn _*moko_, from POc _*mo(g,k)o_ ‘k.o. snake’ (see §5.4.1).

5.5.3.5 Skinks (Scincidae)

Most skinks are slim lizards capable of moving at high speed, although the family includes
the more heavily built blue-tongue lizards. Skinks usually emerge during the day to feed and
bask in the sun. The New Guinea blue-tongue skink, _Tiliqua gigas_, is widely distributed across
eastern Indonesia, the New Guinea mainland, the Admiralty islands and Bismarck Archipelago
(http://www.anapsid.org/bluetong.html). Various Emoia species are widely distributed
through New Guinea and the Pacific. Contemporary languages often distinguish a number of
skink taxa but no POc reconstructions that refer specifically to skinks are supported. However,
John Lynch (pers. comm.) has proposed a reconstruction for Proto Southern Oceanic,
based on cognates in NCV and New Caledonia, and there is evidence for a second term attributable
to Proto Eastern Oceanic.

    The presence of _*kali_ in the following reconstruction raises the question as to whether this
is an echo of the old _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix that in pre-Oceanic times evidently meant something
like ‘Warning. Take care!’ (See ch. 7 for detailed discussion.) Although the evidence is that
the morpheme was no longer productive in Oceanic languages, an association of danger with a
kind of iridescent lizard persists, at least in Tamambo (NCV) and Tikopia (Pn). Jauncey (pers.
comm.) notes that in Tamambo they are generally reviled, people shuddering at the sight of
them. Firth (1967:233) observes that Tikopia _atua_, which applies primarily to a supernatural
entity, is extended as a category name to any natural species which should not be eaten.
Among the latter he includes iridescent lizards.

5.5.4 Snakes (sub-order Serpentes)

5.5.4.1 Land snakes

Around 100 species of land snakes occur in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the
Solomon Islands. They include pythons and boas (family Boidae), both of which constrict
their prey, and a range of tree snakes and ground-dwelling snakes, some of which are highly
venomous. The best known include the Papuan taipan, _Oxyuranus scutellatus_, the Papuan
black snake, _Pseudechis papuanus_, and the death adder, _Acanthopis antarcticus_.

    Only two species of snake have been reported for Vanuatu: the Flowerpot Snake,
Typhlops braminus of Efate and the Pacific Boa, Candoia bibroni, also with restricted distribution
(Medway and Marshall, quoted in Walsh et al. 2000:248). Fiji has two terrestrial snakes, the
Pacific boa and the rare Ogmodon vitianiis, the latter found only in Fiji (Ryan 1988:111-114,
Morrison 2003:90). In Polynesia land snakes are found only in Samoa, while the only land
snake reported for Micronesia is the miniature blind snake found on Chuuk (Davis 1999:188).
For PMP _*nipay_ ‘snake’ only a single Oceanic reflex has been located.

5.5.4.2 Sea snakes (Elapidae)

Sea snakes are venomous elapid snakes that have adapted to living in the sea. Many are
found in shallow coastal waters and estuaries. They have an eel-like appearance, with laterally
compressed bodies and (in many species) paddle-like tails that aid swimming. Sea snakes are
widespread in the Pacific, with one species, Pelamis platurus, the yellow-bellied sea snake,
found across the entire Pacific region. Four species are known in Fiji, two of which, Laticauda
colubrina and _L. laticaudata_, are semi-terrestrial (Ryan 1988:111-114).

   Agreement between Central Pacific and Vanuatu languages allows reconstruction of Proto
Remote Oceanic _*takulasi_ or _*takusali_ ‘sea snake’. Metathesis of consonants has occurred
more than once in the final two syllables, making the original form uncertain.

5.6 Amphibians

The only amphibians present in Oceania are frogs. Menzies (2006:3) writes that ‘at the latest
count, New Guinea [including the Admiralties and Bismarck Archipelago] and the Solomon
Islands have a total of 35 genera and 322 recognised species … and, despite lacking several
frog families present in southeast Asia, the region remains one of the most species-rich in
the world’. East of the Solomons the native frog population is almost negligible. Codrington (1891:17)
notes that frogs are absent in Santa Cruz. An account by Medway and Marshall
(quoted by Walsh et al. 2000:235) contains the following observation: ‘There are no amphibians
native to the New Hebrides [Vanuatu], and none was taken by Dr Felix Speiser who
collected herpetological material in these islands in 1910-12.’ Morrison (2003:11) reports
that there are two endemic species of frogs in Fiji, the Fiji tree frog, Platymantis vitiensis,
and the Fiji ground frog, _P. vitianns_. There are no endemic frogs in Micronesia, nor, with the
exception of New Zealand, in Polynesia. New Zealand has four native species, all belonging
to the genus Leiopelma, an ancient and primitive group of frogs.

    Four families occur without human intervention in New Guinea, Australia and islands of
the western Pacific (Menzies 2006:6): the Hylidae (mostly climbing frogs, found throughout
New Guinea and the Solomons, and on Timor, Seram and Halmahera), Myobatrachidae
(mainly ground-dwelling frogs, with distribution confined to Australia and New Guinea),
Ranidae (pond frogs and some others, a vast family of almost world-wide occurrence), and
Microhylidae, a wide variety of morphologically distinct types. Menzies (2006:172) writes
that Microhylidae ‘is almost worldwide in distribution but reaches its greatest diversity in the
tropics, and the origin of the New Guinean genera almost certainly lies with some currently
unknown southeast Asian ancestor’. The families are unevenly distributed, with 89 percent
of the New Guinea mainland population from just two families, Hylidae and Microhylidae,
while in the Solomon Islands 92 percent are Ranidae. The occurrence of Bufonidae (toads)
in Oceania is due to deliberate or accidental introduction in recent times. The native species
occupy a wide range of habitats, many found well away from water provided humidity is adequate.
A substantial number lack a tadpole stage, the young hatching on land. Complex topography and
close juxtaposition of different habitats have facilitated species differentiation
so that few species are widespread over the whole region. Most species for which adequate
data exists have relatively restricted distribution.

     Certain species of frog are eaten in parts of Melanesia, but we have very limited information
as to which Oceanic communities eat frogs.

     Although onomatopoeia plays a large part in naming kinds of frogs, the picture is
complicated by the fact that different species may have very distinctive calls. Mussau _ropa-ropa_, Lou
_rek-rek_, Dobu _kʷe-kʷe_, Yabem _kʷeŋ-kʷeŋ_, Takia _waŋ-waŋ_, Molima _bʷe-bʷe_, Tolai _rok-rok_ are
all frog names presumably reflecting particular calls. Only the males utter the characteristic
species-specific calls.

    None of the glosses for the several reconstructions proposed here are at all specific. It
seems that wordlist compilers are generally content to collect one or two terms, probably
generic or perhaps identifying a well-known frog of the area, but few sources give more than
minimal details. However, Kalam speakers of the Central Highlands (a non-Austronesian
language of the Trans New Guinea family) distinguish 35 different taxa (Bulmer & Tyler 1968),
and it is probable that many Oceanic communities name more than have been recorded.
In any event, as most species have limited distribution, species names are likely to be local
innovations.

     PMP _*palakaq_ ‘frog’ (ACD: PWMP) has possible cognates in a few Oceanic languages,
although correspondences are irregular.

An additional POc reconstruction, _*kʷekʷe_, is indicated by agreements between Admiralties,

    The following cognate set is confined to Vitu, the New Ireland group, Nehan and Buka.
The fact that _rokrok_ is also Tok Pisin for ‘frog’, from Tolai, makes this set problematic.
However, a portion of Tok Pisin vocabulary has its origins in southern New Ireland languages.

    A POc term for ‘tadpole’ has proved elusive. The etymon _kʷasi_ ‘tadpole’ is found in two
closely related Papuan Tip languages, Molima and Bwaidoga. Elsewhere we find _kʷasi_ ‘k.o.
frog’ in Lau, a SE Solomonic language. However, Lau _kʷ_ reflects POc _*w_, so the term is
evidently a borrowing. No other cognates have been located.

    From the following cognate set, it appears that _*kuni_ may be reconstructed as a PWOc
term for ‘frog’, and with variable modifier as a term for ‘tadpole’ in PT languages.

<

[11] In Dobu the term for crocodile is _warigoa_ and that for seahorse or pipefish _wariwarigoa_, reduplication of
the first two syllables being a common way of indicating an inferior or diminutive form of the named item. It
 seems that here the prefix is being used by analogy.


5.7 Body parts

5.7.1 Mammal body parts

266 Meredith Osmond and Andrew Pawley


Most mammal body-part terms are also terms for human body-parts. For instance, ‘fur’
equates with ‘body hair’ (typically from POc _*pulu_), both ‘hind leg’ and ‘fore leg’ with ‘leg’
(POc _*qaqe_ ‘leg, foot’ or POc _*paqal_ ‘thigh’), ‘paw’ with ‘hand’ (POc _*lima_), and ‘claw’
with ‘nail’ (POc _*kuku_). The generic term for teeth, animal or human, was POc _*[l,n]ipon_, a
term which could also include ‘tusk’ (see §7.1.2 below).


5.7.1.1 Canine tooth

POc _*bati_ evidently referred specifically to canine teeth. These teeth may have been singled
out for special naming in POc times because of their distinctive shape, which made them
suitable for decoration, but cognates occur in Vanuatu with particular reference to pigs. There,
boars sometimes had their upper canine teeth removed to enable the lower tusks to grow in
a circle and re-enter the jawbone. These pigs played a significant role in status rituals, and
languages had numerous terms for boars at various stages of tusk growth.

5.7.1.3 Tail

POc _*iku(R)_ ‘tail’ continues a PAn etymon. Although many Oceanic wordlists simply give
‘tail’ as the gloss, a substantial number indicate that reflexes of this term relate primarily to
tails of quadrupeds. It is likely that more spectacular tail feathers of birds would have been
separately named (Clark reconstructs POc _*lawe_, tail feathers, plume’ in ch. 6) but more
commonplace bird tails were probably referred to by _*ikuR_. Tails of fish are possibly also
included.

     A number of Polynesian languages use reflexes of PPn _*siku_ to refer to fish and animal
tails. These may show contamination from POc _*siku(n)_ ‘elbow, corner’, PPn _*siku_ ‘extremity; end; tail (esp. of fish)’


5.7.2 Reptile body parts

5.7.2.1 Turtle shell

A POc term for the shell or carapace of turtles rests on agreement between Proto Micronesian
_*pʷōca_ and a cognate in an Admiralties language, Wuvulu. The Wuvulu word may be a
borrowing from Micronesian.

<

    In many Polynesian languages and at least one Southeast Solomonic language, reflexes
of POc _*qunap_ ‘fish scales’ also refer to the shell of a turtle. (See also chapter 2, §66.3)

5.7.2.2 Gaps in reconstruction

POc speakers almost certainly had names for several different parts of a turtle in addition to
the shell. Arosi, for instance, has terms for ‘flat back plates of shell’, ‘curved side plates of
shell’ and ‘turtle fat’. However, most dictionaries fail to record such details and we are unable
to make secure reconstructions for other turtle parts.

    From the few items located, it seems that in Polynesia flippers of turtle, stingray and whale
may have been denoted by a derivative of the verb POc _*kaba_ ‘wing’, PEOc _*kaba-kaba_ ‘to
flap wings’, reflexes of which can also refer to pectoral fins of fish (see ch.2, §66.4 and ch.6, §2).
Terms for ‘turtle egg’ are commonly reflexes of the generic term for egg, POc _*qatoluR_.
However, at least one language, To’aba’ita (SES) has a term, _kʷalaruru_ applying specifically
to ‘a collection of turtle or spider eggs’. Sa’a (SES) has _apota_ ‘eggs of turtle or crocodile’.



6 Birds

6.1 Introduction

There may not have been a domain of the Proto Oceanic lexicon corresponding precisely
to the Class Aves. The creatures referred to by reflexes of POc _*manuk_ (below) almost always
include bats and sometimes other flying animals. For example, Kwaio _laŋasi_ (a taboo
replacement for _manu_) ‘in the broadest categorical sense, includes birds, butterflies, moths,
bats, dragonflies and one species of frogs (_Pseudophryne_ sp.)’ (Keesing 1975:119). At its
widest _*manuk_ may have encompassed the entire non-aquatic animal kingdom (for discussion see
chapter 8, §§5 and 6). More restrictive expressions are often coined by adding a
modifier to _*manuk_, typically the verb ‘to fly’, for example Chuukese _māɾ_ ‘living creature of
land or air (other than human)’, _mac̣c̣aŋ_ ‘bird’ (cf. _c̣aŋ_ ‘fly’). The organisation of this book,
however, follows the Linnaean classification, and bats will be found in chapter 5, with only
a couple of cross-references below to connect the two.

     Birds played varied roles in the life of Oceanic speakers. Besides the domesticated fowl
(_Gallus gallus_), some types of birds (including frigate birds and parrots) were caught and kept
as pets. Others were prized as food (pigeons and doves, some seabirds). The large eggs of
the megapode were gathered for food. The feathers of many species had decorative uses, and
their bones were used for a range of artefacts from needles to flutes. Birds could be caught
with snares, nets or traps of various kinds, or shot with bow and arrow. (Special blunt-tipped
arrows avoided damage to valued feathers.) Apart from direct exploitation, some birds could
be sources of useful information, such as flocks of terns indicating the location of schools of
fish, or landbirds far out at sea, indicating the presence of land nearby. Some, on the other
hand, were harmful, such as the raptors that preyed on domestic fowl, or the swamp-hen with
its destructive effects on taro gardens.

     A widespread belief was that the voices of certain species could foretell such events as a
death or the arrival of visitors. In eastern Polynesia, the visitors themselves were referred to
as ‘birds’ (PCEPn _*manu-firi_ ‘chosen (?) birds’). And in myth, folk
tale and religious belief, birds play almost as varied a range of roles as do humans. Among
the Dobuans, ‘the native term for totem is the term for bird … [and] one stranger may ask
another, “what is your bird?”’ (Fortune 1963:32).


6.2 The life and parts of birds

A few aspects of avian anatomy and behaviour are different enough from their human (or
mammalian) analogues that they might be expected to be separately lexicalised. In most cases,
however, POc appears to have found commonalities with more general anatomical features
of the animal kingdom.

    Perhaps the most emblematic features of birds are feathers and wings. But the most general
term for feathers is the same as that for human body hair and animal fur:

      A second set with this meaning is connected with PMP _*ibut_ ‘pull, uproot’ (Blust 1995):

<
POc *ipu ‘hair, feather’
  MM:     Bola             ivu              ‘hair, feather’
  MM:     Nakanai          ivu-la           ‘head hair, plumage of bird’

  SES:    Sa’a             ihu              ‘hair, feather’

    Both of the above refer to the overall covering of birds that is analogous to the hair
covering of mammals. Feathers particularly conspicuous by length or colour have probably always
been of special interest and valued as decoration. A term for such feathers is reconstructed
for PMP, but its unambiguous Oceanic reflexes are restricted in scope:

<
PMP *lawi ‘tail feather’ (Dempwolff 1938)
POc *lawe ‘tail feather, plume’
  Fij:    Rotuman          lalɔvi           ‘feather’

  Pn:     Samoan           lave             ‘a part of a head-dress, a crest’
>

    A number of forms suggested a variant reconstruction _*la-lau_[1]

__formgroup__

 (NNG) _i-laun_ ‘his/her hair, its feathers’.

    A distinct lexical item POc _*banic_ ‘wing, arm, hand, fin (probably pectoral)’ is widely
attested. Its PMP ancestor _*panij_ denoted only wings, but its meaning had clearly been extended
in POc (see chapter 2 for a fuller cognate set and discussion).

   Dempwolff (1938) reconstructs PMP _*kapak_ ‘wings; flutter’ on the basis of Oceanic data

    Blust (ACD) also reconstructs PWMP _*kepek_ ‘flap wings’ (expected POc form †_*kopo(k)_)
and PWMP _*kepay-kepay_ ‘flap (wings, fins of fish, etc.)’ (expected POc form †_*kope_) with
supporting data, and crossreferences the doublets _*kapay_ and _*kipay_ (without supporting
data) (expected POc forms †_*kape_ and †_*kipe_). PMP _*kapay_ is perhaps reflected by Tawala
_apape_ ‘wing’. I find no straightforward reflexes of Blust’s other reconstructions, but Iduna
(PT) _ofa-na_ ‘(its) wing’ and Gela (SES) _gapo-gapo_ ‘spread wings, flap, flutter’ suggest that
there were perhaps several phonologically similar forms in POc cognate with the forms found
in Western Malayo-Polynesian languages.

                                                                                              Birds    277


    A bird’s beak was most probably referred to as POc _*ŋuju_, denoting the external or protruding
aspect of the mouth. There is also some evidence for POc _*muju_, in the form of
non-Oceanic terms from which Blust (ACD) reconstructs PWMP _*mu(n)cuŋ_ ‘mouth (of an
animal), snout’,[2] together with the Iduna, Gapapaiwa and Balawaia terms listed below, reflecting
PPT _*mu(d,j)u_. However, it may be that this is a chance similarity and that PPT
_*muju_ was an irregular reflex of POc _*ŋuju_.[3]

of birds, fish, reptiles and mammals. The following very common term for tail appears applicable to birds in many languages:

    Other anatomical features such as the cock’s comb and spurs are lexicalised diversely and
there is no clear POc reconstruction.

    The laying of relatively large (and often edible) eggs is distinctive of birds (along with
turtles and other reptiles). A well established reconstruction is:

    A word of more general reference, POc _*puaq_, originally ‘fruit’, but generalised as a
classifier for a wide range of more or less spherical objects, is sometimes used for eggs, but
this may well be the result of repeated local extensions.

    Despite the great variety in the form and construction of birds’ nests (note PMic _*fata_
‘platform, nest’ from POc _*patar_ ‘platform’, vol.1, p.57 and p. 190), a common term can be

      A PCP form is also reconstructable:

    The actions surrounding eggs and nests are less distinctively lexicalised. The verb
corresponding to ‘lay’ is etymologically various (e.g. Lau _kʷala_ ‘give birth, beget, lay an egg’,
Bauan _vaka-lutu_ ‘drop, lay (egg)’, Paamese _mūmoni_ ‘make’ _mūmon orelīte_ ‘lay an egg’), but
note the following:

<

  NNG:  Bing             tāw          ‘lay egg’

  NCal: Iaai             hau          ‘lay egg’
>

    The action of incubating eggs by sitting on them is compared with that of covering and
protecting the young in the following verb attributable to PEOc:

<
PEOc *ovi(s), *ovis-i- (1) ‘brood, sit on eggs’; (2) ‘cover chicks with wings’
  SES:   Bugotu       ofi         ‘to sit on eggs, hatch’
  SES:   Tolo         ovi(a)      ‘to sit on and hatch’

  Fij:   Bauan        ovið(a)     ‘to brood, of hens; to cover up the chickens under her wings’
>

   When the egg hatches, the words used are generally those for the breaking open of rigid
containers (the coconut probably being the most familiar comparison), but no consistent etymon emerges.

   The action of flying is as emblematic of birds as their possession of feathers and wings,
and several verbs are associated with it (see also POc _*kaba_ ‘(n) wing, (v) flap wings’ above):

6.3 Bird names

There is a strong consensus among recent researchers locating the Proto Oceanic homeland
in Northwest Melanesia, with the island of New Britain a focus of probabilities. I will follow
this view insofar as it helps give a perspective on the dimensions of the problem of
reconstructing this particular lexical field. In what follows I will use the term ‘homeland’ to refer
to New Britain and its neighbouring islands. The birds among which referents for POc
reconstructions will be sought in this study are those which are residents of or regular visitors to
the Bismarck Archipelago, as described in recent handbooks (Coates 1985, 1990;
Coates & Peckover 2001). This gives a total of slightly more than 200 species belonging to 126 genera,
 77 of them monotypic.

    The reconstructions presented below do not comprise all or even most of a plausible avian
terminology of Proto Oceanic. Entire families of birds which were almost certainly known to
the POc speakers are unrepresented here, because the small number of terms so far recorded
for living Oceanic languages do not yield up any useful cognate sets. Examples are the grebes
(Podicipedidae), pelicans (Pelecanidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), ibises (Threskiornithidae),
nightjars (Caprimulgidae), flowerpeckers (Dicaeidae), waxbills (Estrildidae) and
drongos (Dicruridae). This lack, in turn, is primarily a result of the insufficiency of the data,
particularly for languages of Northwest Melanesia, where the avifauna is the richest. The
situation has improved, but only slightly, since my previous study (Clark 1994b). There is still
an almost complete lack of really comprehensive studies.

    It may be useful, nevertheless, to have some idea of what such a taxonomy would have
looked like. In my earlier paper I reasoned by analogy from two detailed studies from societies
close to the Oceanic region, though both non-Austronesian in language: Majnep & Bulmer (1977)
on Kalam of the New Guinea highlands, and Taylor (1990) on Tobelo of north
Halmahera. Both studies found a total of about 200 lexemes for avian taxa. The typical taxon
corresponds to a Linnaean genus, though as a substantial proportion of genera were monotypic
(represented by a single species) within the area studied, there is a certain ambiguity
between genus and species. Genus-level taxon labels in Kalam, for instance, would include
_ccp_ covering the Australian Goshawk (Accipiterfasciatus) and Black-mantled Goshawk (A.
melanochlamys), _kwwt_ for both the Amboina Cuckoo dove (_Macropygia_ amboinensis) and
the Black-billed Cuckoo dove (_M. nigrirostris_), _mmañp_ labelling both the Glossy Swiftlet
(_Collocalia esculenta_) and the Mountain Swiftlet (_C. hirundinacea_), _plolom_ both the Mountain
Yellow-billed Kingfisher (_Halcyon megarhyncha_) and the Sacred Kingfisher (_H. sanclay_
and _walkobneŋ_ both the Black-fronted White-eye (_Zosterops minor_) and the Mountain Whiteeye
(_Z. novaeguineae_). In some cases, conventional distinguishing expressions exist to discriminate
between the two species, for example, _ccp mseŋ-ket_ ‘Australian Goshawk’ (_mseŋ-ket_ ‘open country’)
versus _ccp kamay-ket_ ‘Black-mantled Goshawk’ (_kamay-ket_ ‘beech tree sp.’).

                                                                                     Birds   283


    On the other hand, some Kalam taxa correspond to Linnaean groups larger than the genus,
and some cut across the terminology altogether, recognizing convergent similarities: _spsep_
refers both to the Mountain Pygmy Parrot (Micropsitta bruijni) and the Pink-faced Nuthatch
(Daphoenositta miranda). _sskl_ refers to both Whitehead’s Swiftlet (Collocalia whiteheadi)
and the Pacific Swallow (_Hirundo tahitica_). (Cf. POc _*kabakabal_ in §5.12.)

    Most birds produce some sound audible to humans, whether territorial song, flocking
calls or alarm cries, and often this is distinctive enough to be recognised as emblematic of
the bird itself. The transcoding of bird vocalizations into human speech sounds is a universal
phenomenon, and birds are probably onomatopoetically named more than any other class of
living things. In theory this can pose an obstacle to the comparative method, if the independent
application of an onomatopoetic name to the same bird in different languages produces
pseudo-cognates. However, the more remotely related the two languages, the less likely such
pairs of names are to follow regular sound correspondences. The approach taken here will
be to accept exact cognate sets as genuine, but cases where there are repeated irregularities
despite similarity of phonetic form will be taken as, at least, suspect for reconstruction purposes.

    In theory we would like to be able to say how POc speakers would have named each
species of bird they were familiar with. Some reasons why this is not possible at the present
state of knowledge have already been reviewed. There is also the fact that, even if we take the
location and date of the POc-speaking community as fairly precisely known, the composition
of the avifauna at that place and time is by no means so certain. The distribution of bird species
is a changing set of circumstances, affected both by expansion of successful species and by
extinction of others. In practice all we have to go on (except for some scattered archaeological
evidence) is the present situation. But even in a situation where several reasonably good
cognate sets are available, which could in theory be assigned to several species present in the
Oceanic homeland, the assignment may be difficult since our data is weakest precisely in the
area where the fauna is richest.

    Below I present nearly 200 cognate sets, of which about 80 are attributed to Proto Oceanic
and the remainder to various interstages. Following a discussion of the domestic fowl, the
families are arranged into three large groups: the non-passerine land and fresh-water birds;
the passerines; and the sea and shore birds. A typical local inventory contains roughly equal
numbers of species in these three groups. (Bregulla 1992 on Vanuatu, for example, has 36
passerine species, 45 sea birds and 40 others.) All scientific and ‘common’ English names
have been normalised to follow the checklist of Howard & Moore (1991).


6.4 The domestic bird: _Gallus gallus_

The Red Jungle Fowl, (_Gallus gallus_), spread as a domesticate along with Oceanic speakers
throughout almost all the Pacific islands. There does not seem to be any clear lexical distinction
between domestic and feral birds, though descriptors may be added, as in Samoan _moa ʔāivao_
‘wild fowl’ (cf _vao_ ‘bush, jungle’). The glosses ‘chicken’ and ‘fowl’ have been taken
as equivalent.

    A number of Oceanic languages use a word for fowl which is most commonly the generic
term for ‘bird’.

>

Note that Bender et al. (2003:327) consider the Micronesian forms to be loans from Chamorro
_mannok_ ‘chicken’.

     A more widely distributed set of terms for the fowl is clearly an imitative term for the
distinctive call of the male bird. A pattern of consonants occurs which could represent POc
_*k-k-r-k_, though the vowels are not consistent and one or other of the consonants may not
appear. Such distant semblances as Japanese _kokekokko_ and French _cocorico_ ‘cock-a-doodle-
doo’ suggest that this sequence may have, contrary to appearances, something natural about
it. And yet, the shift of these words from sound-imitative to referential (including the female)
cannot have taken place many times independently. I therefore hesitantly offer a reconstruction.
However, it is noteworthy that _*k_ in this term is never lenited (to _ɣ_, _ʔ_ etc) in the many
languages where this is a regular change. This presumably reflects its onomatopaeic origin.

    The common Polynesian word for the fowl has no certain external cognates, though it has
apparently been borrowed rather far afield. However, it is possible that Wayan and Bauan _mō_
are cognate with PPn _*moa_, as PCP _*oa_ often becomes _ō_, at least in Western Fijian. If they
are, then PCP _*moa_ is reconstructable, but with uncertain denotation.

    A common observation about animal taxonomy is that terminology for domesticated
species will be more detailed than for most wild species—specific names for sexes, ages
and varieties are to be expected. This does not seem to be the case for the fowl in Proto
Oceanic.

    One term, reconstructed as PMP _*qup_a ‘hen, egg-laying chicken’, appears to have Oceanic
reflexes only in Polynesian and Rotuman (the latter a borrowing):

<

cf. also:
  Fij:      Rotuman     ʔufa          (borrowed from Polynesian source)
>

   The male of the species is most commonly simply denoted by ‘male fowl’ (Manam _maŋ moane_,
Motu _kokoruku maruanena_,’Are’are _kua mane_), and chicks as ‘child of fowl’ (Motu
_kokoroku natuna_, Cemuhi _nahi-ja_, Bauan _luve ni toa_).


6.5 Non-passerine land and fresh water birds

Though in species numbers they are roughly a third of the total, this group of families accounts
for well over half the cognate sets and reconstructions presented here. Land birds are likely to
be seen by everyone in the community, and not just those who go to sea. The non-passerines
are on the whole larger and more conspicuous than the passerines. They are therefore likely
to have names known by everyone. They are also objectively more diverse as a group, and
hence more likely to be recognised and lexicalised (Boster, Berlin & O’Neill 1986: 577-578).


6.5.1 Cassowaries (Casuariidae)

A single species of this family of huge flightless birds, the Dwarf Cassowary (_Casuarius bennetti_),
lives in the Oceanic homeland. Although cassowaries do not extend even into the
Solomons, enough reflexes exist in languages of the NNG, PT and MM groups to support
the reconstruction below. Attribution of such a form to POc is further supported by numerous
cognates in languages to the west, e.g. Biak (SHWNG) _(man)swar_, Kaiwai (CMP) _asawar_
(Anceaux 1961).

6.5.2 Herons (Ardeidae)

The herons of the homeland include three species of large herons or egrets of the genus
Egretta as well as the Green-backed Heron (_Butorides striatus_), the Nankeen Night Heron
(_Nycticorax caledonicus_) and two bitterns (Ixobrychus spp,). Most cognate sets refer to the
large and conspicuous Egretta herons, which may have been the basis for a generic term.

It appears that _*kao_ may have been a generic term for herons in PCP. Both Fijian and Polynesian
introduce new terms (see below) for Egretta, and _*kao_ mainly survives in reference
to less conspicuous species. Among Central Pacific reflexes only the Takuu and Maori reflexes
may be considered unproblematic. The Nukuoro word is probably borrowed from a
Micronesian language.

The relation among the three cognate sets above is not entirely clear. The ordering is based on
their successively narrower distribution, from which one might conjecture that _*kao_ was the
original POc term, _*kaopa_ an extension of this, and _*qopa_ a truncation of _*kaopa_ restricted to
North-Central Vanuatu and its immediate neighbour Temotu area. The above cognate complex is
almost unrepresented in the Papuan Tip group, which seems to replace it with the
following:

   Two of the identifications below are problematic: the Pied Heron, _Egretta picata_, is a

does not occur in the New Guinea area at all.

    Additional clear but highly localised names in the Solomons, Micronesia and Polynesia
also centre around Egretta. POc _*sou_ below is suspect as a POc reconstruction as it only
occurs in the Solomons. However, Numbami (NNG) _saole_ ‘egret’ may be cognate. If it is,
then the POc form was perhaps _*saol_ or _*saul_, but this in turn leaves Numbami final _-e_ for
expected †_-a_ unaccounted for, as well as the lack of the final consonant and echo vowel from
expected Marovo †_coulu_ Nduke †_houlu_.

The East Polynesian forms prefixed with _*kō-_ fall into a large class of nouns so reshaped in
this subgroup. However, the Hawaiian and Maori terms with _*kau-_ suggest the possibility of
influence of the _*kao_ term reconstructed above.

6.5.3 Ducks (Anatidae)

The Pacific Black Duck (_Anas superciliosa_) is the most common duck of the Oceanic region,
but the Grey Teal (_Anas gibberifrons_) is also present in the homeland, as are two species of
Whistling Ducks (Dendrocygna spp,), and various other species of this family are known
as migrants. There is no evidence of domestication of any duck species in pre-European
Oceania. Many languages use a separate lexical item for the introduced domesticates, as
Samoan _pato_ ‘domestic duck’ (from Spanish), _toloa_ ‘wild duck’. Very few descriptions offer
glosses more precise than ‘duck’ or ‘wild duck’. However, Iduna _geluluva_ is explicitly stated
to cover both species of Anas mentioned above, and Nelemwa _kerorōp_ includes both these
as well as the Mallard, _Anas platyrhynchos_). There may be a terminological agreement between
Caaac and Fijian (Lomaivitilevu) in which the Whistling Duck is described as ‘red duck’
(Caaac _nīaŋ mīa_, Fijian _gā-damu_).

    A number of other Polynesian and Fijian languages have bird names formally cognate
with the above, but referring to shore and sea birds. (A number of these innovations are in
the languages of atolls, where ducks are rare or non-occurrent owing to the absence of surface
fresh water.):

6.5.4 Diurnal raptors (Pandionidae, Accipitridae, Falconidae)

These three families are treated together because of obvious similarities in appearance and
habits, as well as overlap in naming practices. They are well represented in the homeland,
with at least ten species. Roughly from largest to smallest, they include the White-bellied Sea
Eagle (_Haliaeetus leucogaster_), the Osprey (_Pandion haliaetus_), several goshawks of genus
Accipiter, the Brahminy Kite (_Haliastur indus_), the Black Honey Buzzard (Henicopernis
infuscata), the Crested Baza (_Aviceda subcristata_), and probably both the Peregrine Falcon
(_Falco peregrinus_) and the Oriental Hobby (_Falco severus_).

    A very large number of terms for birds of prey are recorded, from which a number of
cognate sets emerge; however, associating particular names with particular species is much
more difficult, owing in large part to vague descriptions which use ‘hawk’ or ‘eagle’ to refer
to any bird of prey.

6.5.4.1 Fish-eating raptors (Pandion, Haliaeetus, Haliastur)

Perhaps because of their size alone, these species provide some of the best POc reconstructions.
The following set may represent a generic term:

Figure 6.5: _Haliaeetus leucogaster_, White-bellied Sea Eagle


    The fish-eagle (Haliaeetus) was probably the largest flying creature known to the Proto
Oceanic speakers. (_Haliaeetus leucogaster_ of the homeland is replaced in the Solomons by the very
similar _Haliaeetus sanfordi_.) So it is not surprising to find terms for this species literally meaning
‘big bird’ in a number of languages. In all but one of the following, the first element reflects
POc _*manuk_ ‘bird’, and the second is the local word for ‘big’. These second elements are
etymologically diverse, but Patpatar, Nehan and Puluwatese probably retain the POc form
_*lapuat_ ‘large’ (vol.2:190-191).

[7] ‘Pasismanua’ is the name provisionally used here for ‘native names’ given by Gilliard & Lecroy (1967) for
birds identified during the 1958-59 Gilliard New Britain Expedition. The spellings are impressionistic and the
 language or languages are not clearly identified, but the area of the expedition’s work lies within the territory
 of the Pasismanua group of languages, part of the Southwest New Britain Linkage.

6.5.5 Megapodes (Megapodiidae)

Megapodes or scrub fowl (_Megapodius_ spp.) are found from the homeland south to Vanuatu
and as far east as the island of Niuafo’ou in Tonga. The representative in the homeland is
the Bismarck Scrub Fowl (_Megapodius eremita_). All three of the name-sets below may be of imitative
origin, given the bird’s two-syllable calls ending in [au]-like sounds. (Hadden (2004a:78)
gives ‘_paa-au_’, ‘_keeawau keeawuh_’, ‘_keereow keerow_’ and ‘_kiau kiau_’ as representations of
its calls.)

Apart from the domestic fowl, the only representative of this family in the homeland is the
Indian Blue Quail (_Coturnix chinensis_). In the following comparison, a POc reconstruction
is justified if the Mangap and Tolai forms are regarded as continuing the PAn etymon.

6.5.7 Rails (Rallidae)

The numerous rails of Oceania include the very widespread Purple Swamphen (_Porphyrio porphyrio_),
easily recognised by its large size and red forehead. Among the smaller species
are the Buff-banded Rail (_Rallus philippensis_) and White-browed Rail (_Porzana cinerea_),
which occur throughout much of the Oceanic region, and in the homeland three others of the
genus Rallus, as well as the Bare-eyed Rail (_Eulabeornis plumbeiventris_), Red-necked Crake
(_Rallina tricolor_), and Rufous-tailed Moorhen (_Amaurornis olivaceus_).

    The only other rail forwhich widespread cognate sets exist is the Buff-banded Rail
(_Rallus philippensis_). The following possible POc reconstruction has only slender support:

The hypothetical Tahiti Rail (_Rallus pacificus_) is known only from a painting made on Cook’s
second voyage (duPont 1976:41), but the name recorded agrees with the evidence of its appearance
that it was a species of Rallus.

     The only reconstruction for the Sooty Crake (_Porzana tabuensis_) is restricted to Polynesian.

The Nukuoro name looks like a regular development of PPn _*moso_, but the Kapingamarangi
suggests possible borrowing from Micronesian (cf. Mokilese _mʷiɔk_).


6.5.8 Pigeons and doves (Columbidae)

This family is among the most richly elaborated in the Oceanic realm. Almost every island
has at least one or two representatives, and the Proto Oceanic speakers may have been acquainted
with twenty or more species. The most widely distributed Columbidae belong to
two genera: the Imperial Pigeons (_Ducula_ spp.), and the much smaller Fruit Doves (Ptilinopus spp.).
Other genera represented include Gymnophaps, Columba, _Macropygia_, Reinwardtoena,
Chalcophaps, Gallicolumba, Henicophaps, and the shaggy-plumaged Nicobar Pigeon,
_Caloenas nicobarica_.

    The most likely candidate for a generic is the following, which is identified as generic
in some languages (Gedaged, Tawala, Muyuw), and elsewhere refers to a wide range of
columbid genera. In some local areas, however, it appears to have become specialised.

    An isolated Micronesian form appears as a possible cognate of this set, Kiribati _pitin_
‘ground dove, _Gallicolumba_ sp.’. The exact species reference of the Kiribati term is unclear.
However, Pratt et al. (1987:194-5) indicate that this bird was introduced to Kiribati (Abemama)
about 1940 from some other Pacific island. Since none of the possible source islands
have words resembling _bitin_, it would seem much more likely that this name (phonetically
[pisin]) is a borrowing from English pigeon.

The absence of glottal stop in the Tongan and E Futunan forms shows that this name is likely
imitative of the species’ voice, rather than derived from _tuʔu_ ‘stand’ (referring to the species’
ground-feeding habits). However, in languages where the glottal stop has been lost the two
would be homophonous, and _tū-kere_ may be understood by present day speakers as ‘stands
on the ground’.

Imitative naming is a high probability here; cf. PAn _*qekuŋ_ ‘owl’, PWMP _*bekur_ ‘coo, turtle
dove’, PMP _*bukaw_ ‘owl sp.’ (Blust 2002). The voice of _Macropygia mackinlayi_ is represented as
‘kor-wu’ or ‘vo-ku’ (Hadden 2004a: 114). A metathetic variant is represented by Teop (MM)
_uvo_ ‘_Macropygia mackinlayi_’, cf. Koiari (Papuan) _kuvo_ ‘Lesser Bar-tailed Cuckoo Dove,
_Macropygia_ nigrirostris’.

    The following set undoubtedly owes something to imitation of typical pigeon ‘coo’
vocalizations—low pitched but with strong formant structure. Compare the Wayan Fijian name for
a species introduced from Asia in modern times: _kukurū_ ‘Spotted-necked Dove, Streptopelia

6.5.9 Parrots (Loriidae, Cacatuidae, Psittacidae)

The three families united here are represented by nine diverse genera in the homeland. By
far the largest bird, not confusible with any other, is the Blue-eyed Cockatoo
(_Cacatua ophthalmica_). The large Eclectus Parrot (Eclectus roralus) shows striking sexual dimorphism,
with males (green) and females (red) often lexically distinguished. The Rainbow Lory
(_Trichoglossus haematodus_) is probably the most conspicuous and widespread parrot in western
Oceania. Among other middle-sized parrots are the Cardinal Lory (_Chalcopsitta cardinalis_),
the Purple-bellied Lory (Lorins hypoinochrous) and the Singing Parrot (Geoffroyus heteroelitus).
Smaller parrots include two Lorikeets of the genus Charmosyna, which, along with
the closely related genus Vini, are found as far as eastern Polynesia. Smallest of all are the
Pygmy Parrots of genus Micropsitta and the Orange-fronted Hanging Parrot (_Loriculus aurantiifrons_).
For the last (which is found no further east than New Guinea) not a single name
was found in any of the sources.

                                                                                   Birds    321



6.5.9.1 Cockatoos

Only Papuan Tip languages supply sufficient cognates to support reconstructions for these
birds. That the first term may be traceable to POc, however, is suggested by possible cognates
in SHWNG languages such as Ansus _kara_, Serui-Laut _karai_, Ambai _kara_ ‘cockatoo’
(Anceaux 1961).

6.5.9.2 The Eclectus Parrot

This large parrot (_Eclectus roratus_) is most notable for its sexual dimorphism, with the
predominantly red-plumaged female and green-plumaged male sometimes being separately lexicalised.
The first two reconstructions are similar in form, and appear to refer to the male.
Unfortunately, sources for the few languages that reflect both the shorter and longer term are
unhelpful as to the distinction of meaning. Apparent reflexes of the first reconstruction extend
well beyond the range of the Eclectus, and are applied to various other species, eventually
reaching as far as New Zealand.

6.5.9.3 Middle-sized parrots

The following four reconstructions appear to be cut from the same basic form: the first with a
three-consonant sequence, and each of the others missing one of the three. It would be natural
to treat the others as simply variously reduced forms of the longest form, but there are apparent
contrasts in several languages. The references are to medium-sized parrots (Chalcopsitta,
Lorius, Trichoglossus), but it is difficult to see any consistent association between a particular
species and any of these forms. Beyond the Solomons, the first two species disappear, and
these terms are applied to Trichoglossus, or in New Caledonia to the parakeets of genus
Cyanoramphus.

6.5.10 Cuckoos (Cuculidae)

Eight species of this family are recorded from the homeland, two as seasonal visitors. They
include parasitic cuckoos of the genera Cuculus, Cacomantis, Chalcites, Urodynamis, Urodynamis
and Scythrops, and two Coucals of the genus Centropus. Names recorded, however, are
far fewer than for the parrots with a comparable number of species. Only one small cognate
set of Proto Oceanic scope has been found.

6.5.11 Owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae)

The Barn Owls (Tytonidae) and Typical Owls (Strigidae) are each represented in Oceania
by a single genus. The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is probably the most widespread owl of the
Oceanic region. In the homeland it coexists with the endemic New Britain Barn Owl (_Tyto aurantia_).
There are also two Hawk Owls of the genus Ninox. While the voice of the Barn
Owl is described as a screech, Typical Owls (like pigeons) have calls whose acoustic profile
suggests the low second formant of [u]-type vowels. The Solomon Islands Hawk Owl
(_Ninox jacquinoti_), for example, has a call described as ‘’Kuurrroo’ with rolled ‘r” (Hadden
2004a: 155). The prevalence of such vowels in the first three cognate sets places them under a
certain degree of uncertainty. Note, however, that reflexes of _*lulu_ are found mostly in areas
where the Barn Owl is the only owl present, and are therefore unlikely to be imitative.

    There is at present an owl-free area in Eastern Polynesia, which may account for the
maritime application of some of these words. However, owls and petrels have in common that
they are seldom seen, and mainly known by their calls at night. Spenneman (2004:149) notes
that _licemᵚao_, the present Marshallese term for the female of the Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus)
was given by an earlier source for a type of petrel. (The name is probably analysable
as _li-_ ‘feminine prefix’ + ? + _mᵚa_ ‘cry’ + _o_ ‘oh!’.)

6.5.12 Swifts and swallows (Apodidae, Hemiprocnidae, Hirundinidae)

These three groups are closely allied in general appearance and habits and rarely distinguished
terminologically. The swiftlets are familiar birds of garden areas throughout much of Oceania.
The most common species noted are the White-rumped Swiftlet (_Aerodramus spodiopygius_),
Uniform Swiftlet (_Aerodramus vanikorensis_) and White-bellied Swiftlet (_Collocalia esculenta_). These
are not in general lexically distinguished. The few terms recorded for the Pacific Swallow
(Hirundo lahitica) and the even fewer for the Whiskered Tree-swift (_Hemiprocne mystacea_)
are often lexically associated with those for the Swiftlets, and where they are not, they do not
support any independently reconstructible term. These birds are also terminologically linked
with small insectivorous bats: SE Ambrym (NCV) _avœp_ ‘any small bat; swiftlet’; E Futunan
_pekapeka_ ‘White-rumped Swiftlet’, _pekapeka saʔi_ ‘small bat sp.’ (see ch.5, §2.9).

6.5.13 Kingfishers (Alcedinidae)

Ten species of Kingfisher are recorded for the homeland, half of them in the genus Halcyon,
which extends widely through Oceania. Particularly widespread are the White-collared Kingfisher
(_Halcyon chloris_), the Sacred Kingfisher (_Halcyon sancta_) and the White-headed Kingfisher (_Halcyon saurophaga_).
Other kingfishers of the homeland include the very large White-tailed
Kingfisher (_Tanysiptera sylvia_), and the small birds of genera Ceyx and Alcedo. A number of good
cognate sets exist, but assignment to species is very problematic. The relatively few terms for
non-Halcyon species do not form any useful cognate sets. Blust (2002:113) compares POc
_*(sj)iko_ with PMP _*cikep_ ‘catch with hands’.

This word appears to have been reshaped in Polynesian to PPn _*tiko-tara_, a compound
analysable as ‘defecate’ + ‘end of house’. Some outliers have returned to a historically earlier
form through non-Pn influence. The Bauan Fijian word for kingfisher has a general resemblance
to the Polynesian _*tikotara_ forms, but cannot be formally reconciled with them; more
exact agreement is found in the first part of the word _sikorere_, though with slightly deviant
reference:

__formgroup__

   Fij: Bauan         sikorere         ‘White-breasted Wood Swallow, _Artamus leucorhynchus_’

   The following two sets are likely to be at least influenced by imitation of the voice of
Halcyon kingfishers, represented as _ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-i-i-ee_ (Watling 2004:137).

6.5.14 Rollers (Coraciidae)

The single species in this family in the Oceanic homeland, the Dollar Bird (_Eurystomus orientalis_)
can be associated with two small cognate sets, though there are problems of identification.

    The obsolete generic in Roviana most probably refers to the Lineated Cuckoo Shrike
(_Coracina lineata_). Since the terms below are distributed only around the Western Oceanic/SE
Solomonic boundary, it is possible that terms have been borrowed across the boundary. If so,
there is no support for a POc reconstruction.

    There are very similar names for this bird in some Papuan languages of Bougainville, such
as Buin _kikitou_, Koromira _mekikiro_, which may be borrowings from Oceanic languages.


6.5.15 Hornbills (Bucerotidae)

Two good cognate sets are available for the single species, Blyth’s Hornbill (Acerosplicatus),
which occurs throughout New Guinea and the Solomons.

The following indicate a considerable broadening of the reference of this term in some SE
Solomonic languages:

__formgroup__
   SES: ’Are’are    |pina (ni āno)|      ‘big grey pigeon’ (_āno_ ‘garden’)
   SES: Sa’a        |pine (ni ou) |      ‘Nicobar Pigeon, _Caloenas nicobarica_’
   SES: Arosi        bina                ‘hawk’

   SES: Arosi       |bina (suʔu)  |      ‘_Caloenas nicobarica_’ (_suʔu_ ‘lake, swamp’)

    The hornbill’s voice is described as ‘various deep grunts and honking notes’
(Coates & Peckover 2001:113). Given the lack of exact agreement among the following names, it is
likely that at least some represent repeated imitative coinages.

The very large bill of the hornbill would account for the mis-identification as ‘toucan’ in
the Bugotu and Gela sources. The toucan is a tropical American bird also celebrated for its
extremely large bill.


6.6 Passerine birds

Although the Passerines belong to a single order (Passeriformes) among more than 20 within
the class Aves, they account for more than half of all bird species. Yet in the present study
there are far fewer cognate sets for passerines than for the rest. On the basis of the Kalam and
Tobelo studies, there seems no reason to think that the Proto Oceanic speakers did not name
the passerines in as much detail as other types of bird. Two factors may have contributed to
the relative paucity of passerine cognate sets. First, many species are highly localised, which
may have produced a high rate of turnover (abandonment and recreation of terms) as the
Oceanic speakers migrated away from their homeland. Second, since these birds are, on average,
smaller and less conspicuous (and of less economic importance) than the non-passerines,
an accurate identification would require both a researcher with the means and inclination to
go where the birds are, and a speaker as thoroughly informed about the avifauna as were the
Oceanic ancestors. It is just this type of information that is lacking for most Oceanic languages;
passerines are undoubtedly over-represented among the ‘unidentified bird species’
entries in the dictionaries.


6.6.1 Trillers and cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae)

The cuckoo-shrikes (_Coracina_ spp.) and trillers (_Lalage_ spp.) extend from the homeland into
southern Melanesia. Some local cognate sets exist.

6.6.3 Fantails (Rhipiduridae) and flycatchers (Monarchidae)

The flycatchers (Myiagra, Monarcha) and fantails (Rhipidura) extend widely into the Oceanic
region, but evince only a few local cognate sets.

The highly distinctive appearance and behaviour of fantails, and their tolerance of human
proximity, make them familiar birds, much better represented by widespread cognate sets
than the other flycatchers.

The first part of this compound clearly relates to _riu_ ‘turn’, referring to the bird’s characteristic
turns with spread tail feathers, both in flight and perching. In two languages the following
element is a body part: Sa’a _pote_ ‘buttocks’, Gela _pege_ ‘forepart of thigh’. But the more
widespread second element seems more likely to be related to POc _*kapak_, compare Arosi
_kape_ ‘flutter’.

well as the New Britain Friarbird (_Philemon cockerelli_) and Gilliard’s Honeyeater (Melidectes
whitemanensis). Other birds of this family can be found as far as Fiji and western Polynesia.

6.6.7 Starlings (Stumidae)

much of Oceania. The first two cognate sets may be related.

The Shrikebill has in common with the starlings only a similar size and rather drab colouring.
The Huia of New Zealand, a much larger bird, presents even less obvious similarity, and may
have been named in imitation of its whistling call.

The definition of Drehet _pʷisi_ is a good description of _Aplonis metallica_. Yapese _gœʔpluw_
‘small black bird sp.’ bears a striking resemblance to the Rennellese word, but given the lack
of precise identification and the absence of known borrowing in this direction, this is probably
coincidental.

    The following appears to be a continuation of POc _*midi_, reconstructed above (§6.6) as
originally applying to honeyeaters, but extended in Polynesia to the starlings and toilers, on
the basis of similarities which remain unclear.

6.7 Sea and shore birds

The sea and shore birds have in common that the species tend to be wide ranging rather
than localised, many of them migrants or wanderers. The larger families contain numerous
species whose field discrimination can be difficult. Observation of these birds becomes more
common as sea orientation becomes more dominant, so that the most precise and detailed
taxonomies are found in Micronesian and Polynesian languages.


6.7.1 Petrels (Procellariidae, Hydrobatidae)

Petrels come to land only to breed, and may be known primarily from the strange noises
they make at their burrows at night. Of several species recorded for the homeland, only the
Wedge-tailed Shearwater (_Puffinus pacificus_) breeds in the vicinity and is present year round.

    There is a certain degree of crossover apparent between the families of petrels, albatrosses
and boobies.

6.7.2 Tropic-birds (Phaethontidae)

The two species of tropic-bird (Phaethon) are rare in Papua New Guinea waters but more
frequently encountered in Remote Oceania. The Red-tailed Tropic Bird (_Phaethon rubricauda_) and
the White-tailed Tropic Bird (_Phaethon lepturus_) differ, as their names suggest, in the colour of the
two extremely elongated tail feathers by which this type of bird is readily recognised. They
are generally covered by a single lexical item, though there may be a conventional specifier
for one or the other, as in Tongan _tavake toto_ ‘_Phaethon rubricauda_’ (_toto_ ‘blood’).

6.7.3 Boobies (Sulidae)

Figure 6.20: _Sula dactylatra_, Blue-faccd Booby

Of the three Boobies (genus Sula) found in Oceania, the Brown Booby (_Sula leucogaster_) is
present year round in New Guinea waters. The Red-footed Booby (_Sula sula_), however, is also
widely reported, while the Blue-faced Booby (_Sula dactylatra_) appears to be the least common.
Only in Polynesia and Micronesia are the three species lexically distinguished.

6.7.4 Frigate birds (Fregatidae)

Two species of frigate bird are common in New Guinea waters, the Great Frigate Bird (_Fregata minor_)
and the Lesser Frigate Bird (_Fregata ariel_). (The identifications of other species for
Puluwat and Roviana below are likely to be erroneous.) Two clear POc reconstructions can
be justified, though there seems to be no consistent lexical differentiation between the two
species in the sources for contemporary languages.

6.7.5 Waders (Charadriidae, Scolopacidae, Burhinidae)

More than twenty species of these shore birds frequent the coasts of the Oceanic homeland,
but most are migrants seen only seasonally. Among the most commonly identified
are the Bristle-thighed Curlew (_Numenius lahiliensis_), Whimbrel (_Numenius phaeopus_),
Bartailed Godwit (_Limosa lapponica_), Wandering Tattler (_Heteroscelus incanus_), Pacific Golden
Plover (_Pluvialis fulva_), and Ruddy Turnstone (_Arenaria interpres_). Field identification of
these birds can be difficult, and even in Polynesia and Micronesia there are few cognate sets
with completely consistent reference.

The set above is perhaps cognate with the set from which PWOc _*kiwiwi_ ‘sandpiper sp.’
(p.360) is reconstructed. There are also probable Western Oceanic cognates, namely Tawala
(PT), Gapapaiwa (PT) _kiu_ ‘bird (generic)’ and Nakanai (MM) _e-kivu_ ‘bird sp.’. Together with
the set above these imply the reconstruction of POc _*kiu_, but its gloss cannot be reconstructed,
as the Tawala and Gapapaiwa generic presumably reflects the promotion of a bird taxon term
to generic status, and the Nakanai gloss is not specific.

    Hote (NNG) _kakapʸak_, glossed as a ‘small black bird like a swallow; doesn’t sit in a tree

6.7.6 Terns (Laridae)

The family Laridae includes both gulls and terns. Gulls are mainly birds of the temperate
zones, and are only rare visitors to tropical Oceania. The common gloss ‘seagull’ in dictionaries
and vocabularies of languages in this area almost certainly indicates a tern. Several
species of tern (Sterna, Thalasseus) are common in the waters of the homeland, along with
noddies (Anous) and the very distinctive White Tern (_Gygis alba_).

7 Insects and other creepy-crawlies

7.1 Introduction

The Oceanic Lexicon Project is concerned both with reconstruction of POc terms and their
meanings and with compiling a picture of the kind of culture that can be associated with these
reconstructed concepts.[1] My intention here is not just to identify the insects that existed in
the world of Proto Oceanic speakers but also to consider their role in it. Were they dangerous
or merely pesky, harmless, insignificant or perhaps useful? Were they associated with the
supernatural? The perceived role of an insect depends on the way in which it impinges on
human lives, whether by biting or stinging, by being highly visible or noisy, by attacking
woodwork or food plants, by being a valued food, and so on. Occasionally we find linguistic
clues that throw additional light.

    It should be noted that the term ‘insects’ is used here in its popular extended sense to
include spiders, centipedes, and other creepy-crawlies such as grubs, worms and leeches.

    The difficulty of the task is increased by the sheer size of the Oceanic world, involving as it
does many different environments. Compared with other animals, insects are highly adaptable
(capable of living in a wide range of environments), easily transportable (by man, animal
or wind), and numerous in both kind and number. Consequently, it is difficult to plot the
distribution of even a major order, such as scorpions or leeches. Ideally it would be useful to
know whether a given creature exists in a region (in one or more readily identifiable species),
and if so, whether it has been there at least as long as the first settlers. Even this information
is of little use, however, unless we also have local names. Specialised entomological tomes,
dealing with, say, the Hymenoptera of Vanuatu, rarely have this information.

    For the time being, then, we make do with the most readily available information, culled
from general wordlists fleshed out by ethnographic descriptions. Many apparent cognates
show unexpected variation in gloss, so that the term for a mosquito in language A becomes
that for sandfly in language B, wasp terms move to bee, centipede to millipede, grasshopper
to cricket to cicada, and so on. I have to decide if this is due to change in distribution of
the creature, or perhaps reflects the insect’s lack of importance to a community, or may be a
deficiency in the wordlist.

[1] Particular thanks are due to Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross for unfailing help and advice. I am also grateful
 to Ann Chowning, John Lynch, Ross Clark and the late Phil Quick for a host of useful data and comments.

    Another factor to be considered is a seemingly high degree of phonological irregularity in
 some insect names. This manifests itself at times in collections of terms which share strong
resemblance but for which no reconstruction is possible. At other times it results in doublets,
where two or more very similar reconstructions can be made for the same insect. Terms
for noisy insects are likely to be influenced by onomatopoeia, while terms for insects that
jump or sting or tickle may be derived from relevant verbs. This may help explain why I can
have several reconstructions for an insect that are based on quite limited cognate sets, but
no one dominant form. In contrast, terms such as POc _*kutu_ ‘louse’ and POc _*laŋo_ ‘fly’ are
particularly stable, their reflexes occurring in a very high proportion of languages throughout
the Oceanic region.

     One further concern of this chapter is the role of a particular prefix in insect names as
a possible supernatural marker. In 1983 Robert Blust presented a paper at the Third Eastern
Conference on Austronesian Linguistics entitled _A linguistic key to the early Austronesian spirit world_[2].
It dealt with the frequent occurrence of an affix, often fossilised, in Austronesian
languages, traceable back to PAn. Its typical form was _qali-_ or _kali-_, although there were
a number of variants. Blust listed 62 lexical sets containing over 570 examples from about
 50 languages distributed geographically from Taiwan to Polynesia, with the vast majority
occurring in Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. When these 62 lexical sets were sorted
into semantic categories, 20 were for creepy-crawly life forms, the largest single category.
Other categories were bats/birds (six sets including doves, owls), striking natural phenomena
(six sets, including rainbows, echoes, whirlpools), body parts (five sets, including pupil of
eye, hair whorl), and muddled psychological states (four sets, including being dizzy, talking/walking
in one’s sleep). The puzzle for Blust was to assign a single conceptual principle
that linked these apparently disparate meanings. If _qali-_/_kali-_ was a morpheme, what did it
mean?

    He realised that in a substantial number of cases the referents had a connection — most
commonly a dangerous connection — with the world of spirits. Insects in particular were associated
with spirits of the dead. The _qali-_/_kali-_ terms listed by Blust (updated in 2001b: 37)
refer to the following creepy-crawlies: ant/termite, honey bee, bumble bee, beetle, butterfly,
caterpillar, centipede, cockroach, crab, cricket, dragonfly, earthworm, firefly, flea, gecko,
grasshopper, jungle leech, paddy leech, luminous millipede, scorpion, snake, spider, wasp.
Other phenomena he lists (rainbows, whirlpools, sleep-walking etc.) are thought of as supernatural
events/conditions. In other words, the _qali-_/_kali-_ terms indicated a taboo, a warning
that certain kinds of behaviour were to be avoided in the presence of these creatures or events.
It would be an advantage for such taboos to be linguistically clearly marked, to be learned
early by children.

    Blust strengthens his argument by considering the kinds of insects which are not marked
by _qali-_/_kali-_. He sorts them into creatures that (i) tend to invade human space (maggot,
horsefly, housefly, both types of lice, mosquito, nit), or (ii) are economically important either
because they are edible (sago grub), or because they cause damage to human crops or
constructions (termite).[3] In contrast, the marked creatures have little or no economic importance.
In addition, some of these, particularly fireflies and luminous millipedes, have unusual
properties which might be regarded as supernatural (pp 37-38).

[2] Now published as Blust (2001b).

[3] Where a creature is listed as both marked and unmarked, the unmarked tends to be generic while the marked
 singles out individual species (Blust 2001b: 37).

    Blust concludes his argument: ‘In short, then, the function of the _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix
evidently was to mark facets of experience that were regarded as spiritually dangerous, hence
requiring special precautions of a sort likely to be violated by incompletely accultured children.
It did this purely by lengthening the affixed word to an atypical quadrisyllable shape,
hence marking the associated semantic categories as those requiring particular behavioural
sensitivity’ (p.59).

     One of my purposes in this study, then, is to see to what extent _qali_-denoted insects are
regarded as creatures with supernatural associations in Oceanic languages. At first glance,
it would seem that the Oceanic lexical forms no longer hold the same WARNING TAKE CARE
message. Nonetheless, the affix, or traces of it, occurs in a large number of Oceanic languages
in a range of insect terms, and I have been able to reconstruct it to POc level in a small number
of items.


7.2 Lice (Order Anoplura: Family Pediculidae)

One of the largest cognate sets in the entire lexicon of POc reconstructions is that reflecting
_*kutu_ ‘louse’. Its reflexes serve in places as a generic term for lice and fleas, often in
compound form, when they refer to other creatures parasitic on plants or animals such as
‘pig louse’ or ‘dog flea’. The very size of the set (I have over 100 reflexes) and their
consistency of referent, must reflect its relative salience for witnesses in contemporary
languages. The set below is simply a representative sample. Also reconstructed is POc _*tuma_
‘body louse’. In Nakanai, Roviana and Gela, languages where reflexes of both _*kutu_ and _*tuma_
survive, reflexes of _*tuma_ now refer to ‘flea, house louse, bed bug’, ‘house bug’ or
‘(mat-eating) moth’ respectively. As well, I have a widely reflected term for the louse egg
or nit and a number of terms for the action of searching for headlice. This grooming activity was
no doubt a regular feature of social life.

7.2.2 Body lice

Because clothes did not feature strongly in the lives of Proto Oceanic speakers, who did not
make use of woven cloth, I have preferred to gloss the POc reflex of PAn _*tumeS_ ‘clothes louse’
as ‘body louse’. These creatures would no doubt have continued to exist in Proto
Oceanic household items such as the woven pandanus matting generally used as sleeping
mats (vol.1, p.80). Although the term has survived in Proto Oceanic, its PAn/PMP meaning
has been restored in Niuean and East Futunan reflexes, perhaps fortuituously, through the
modern advent of clothing. It seems that in societies where woven clothes were not worn, the
distinction between the different kinds of lice was not significant, and either term was used
in places as a generic for functionally similar creatures.

In addition to POc _*lisaq_ ‘nit’ I have reconstructed PWOc _*lejaq_ ‘nit’. Both forms are securely

or may reflect an early borrowing.

7.2.4 Search head for lice

One POc term and one Proto Remote Oceanic term have been reconstructed with specific reference to searching
for lice. Other terms with more general meaning, particularly POc _*tirop_, _*tirop-i_ ‘look
intently’, are sometimes used. In Kove (NNG) the expression is _ravu tuma_ ‘feel for lice’
(Ann Chowning, pers. comm.).These terms indicate the likelihood of reciprocal grooming,
an activity undertaken in many societies as part of social interaction.

7.3 Butterflies (Order Lepidoptera = ‘scaly wings’)

A number of formally similar reconstructions for butterfly have been made above the level
of POc: PAn _*(qali)-beŋbeŋ_, PMP _*kali-mbembeŋ_ and PSHWNG _*kalə-mbombəŋ_. From the
first-mentioned one would expect the regularly derived POc _*kali-boboŋ_. It does appear, but
its reflexes are with one exception limited to the North New Guinea subgroup. The most
widespread Oceanic cognate set, yielding POc _*(kau)bebek_, cannot be derived directly from
PMP.

   POc _*[kau]bebek_ has reflexes throughout almost the entire Oceanic region apart from
NNG. The added _-a_ in Molima, Dobu, Sewa Bay, Duau, Bwaidoga and ’Auhelawa reflects a

    What are we to make of these variations? Butterflies, like lice and flies, are commonplace,
but whereas I have extremely stable cognate sets for the latter two, butterfly terms in
Western Oceanic have many slightly different forms. It is as if there is wordplay, with small
changes being deliberately made to a word. Was there something culturally significant about
butterflies, perhaps some trace of the supernatural that the _kali-_ prefix reflects, that gave rise
to some taboo about the use of the normal term? Although I have examples of an association
between butterflies and the supernatural in Sa’a (Ivens 1927:187), Maori (Andrew Crowe
pers. comm.) and Easter Island (Steven Roger Fischer pers. comm.) I have no comparable
examples from Western Oceanic. Malcolm Ross (pers. comm.) suggests an explanation involving a
different kind of cultural taboo.

     There is a widespread origin legend along the New Guinea north coast based on the activities
of two brothers, Manub (blue dove) and Kilibob (butterfly), who, between them, ‘made
their dwelling places, sun, moon and stars etc. and also the people, and gave them all their
customs and usages’ (Pech 1991:81). It happens that such legends may be seen to belong to
particular clans in their traditional form. Others may continue the legends but lack the right
to use traditional names (Pech 1991:116). If this were the case, it would be the names, rather
than the creature, which were subject to some kind of taboo. It may have been some such reason
that is the explanation for the numerous variations in the WOc butterfly term. The EOc
terms, however, are quite consistent, all derived from one of the WOc variations, _*bebek_, so
evidently no longer subject to the same taboo pressures.

     Although POc speakers evidently included moths and butterflies within one generic term,
I have a lower-level reconstruction which is limited to moths, possibly a particular kind of
moth. Samoan and Tikopia reflect _*lele-fua_ while the Central Eastern Polynesian languages
appear to have added a prefix of unclear function.

7.4 Mosquitoes (Order Diptera = ‘two wings’: Family Culicidae)

A POc reconstruction for ‘mosquito’, _*ñamuk_, is based on numerous cognates from all major
subgroups, with little variation in meaning, together with a PMP antecedent. In some Papuan Tip
languages reflexes form compounds to refer to a range of small flying biting insects. The PT
reflexes have undergone a common sporadic vowel change, lowering of unstressed _-u_ to _-o_.

    A number of terms that refer to the mosquito have been
reconstructed in addition to _*ñamuk_.

   The following reconstruction shares the same second syllable as _*ñamuk_ ‘mosquito’.
Both _*ñamuk_ and _*simuk_ evidently referred to ‘mosquito’ in WOc, although _*simuk_ may
have had a broader semantic range than _*ñamuk_, its reflexes at times referring to other small
biting flies. Southeast Solomonic terms reflect Proto Southeast Solomonic _*simi_ rather than †_*simu_.
(Maringe _si-simi_ is evidently borrowed from a neighbouring SES language). Reflexes of
_*simuk_ are not found in subgroups east of the Solomons.

    Another term, POc _*ma-kini(t)_, is also reconstructable, with reflexes thar refer to ‘mosquito’
in Western Oceanic, but in Remote Oceanic rather to the state of being stung. As a literal
translation of a form of the verb _*kini-t_, ‘to pinch’, _*ma-kini(t)_ means ‘to get pinched’, i.e. ‘get
stung’. The languages in which reflexes of _*ma-kini(t)_ are listed have all lost POc final consonants,
and putative final _*-t_ is reconstructed on the basis of etymology. In languages such

    A tendency to identify small buzzing and biting insects with nasal-initial terms and frequent
reduplication is noted with _*ñamuk_ as well as POc _*ŋiŋi(ŋ)_ and PWOc _*ŋati-ŋati_ below,
and is apparent also in the terms for sandfly/midge/gnat in the following section (POc
_*niku-niku_, _*nonok_, _*ŋi(s,j)i_). Most are onomatopaeic, using _n_, _ñ_ and _ŋ_ almost interchangeably,
making it difficult to trace cognate forms.

7.5 Sandflies, midges, gnats (Order Diptera: Families Chironomidae (non-biting), Ceratopogonidae, Psychodidae, Simuliidae (biting); Families Drosophilidae, Tephritidae (fruitflies))

Cognates in the following sets refer to a range of very small flying biting insects. Vagueness
of identity may be due to the fact that speakers have no real need to distinguish these insects
more precisely.

    POc _*niku-niku_ from PMP _*nik-nik_ rather than the expected †_*ninik_ may simply be another
example of the playful variation prevalent in some insect terms.

    Polynesian reflexes of _*nonok_ ‘sandfly, midge’ appear to refer to fruitflies and perhaps
other small non-biting flies. The Cristobal-Malaitan terms reflect PCM _*nono(i)tasi_, literally
‘fly of salt water’.

7.6 Flies (Order Diptera: Families Muscidae (houseflies, bluebottles), Tabanidae (horseflies), Bibionidae (Marchflies))

7.6.1 Flies (generic); houseflies

Blust (2002) has reconstructed both PMP _*lalej_ ‘housefly’ and PMP _*laŋaw_ ‘botfly, bluebottle’.
The latter became in POc the generic term for flies, with reflexes often referring
specifically to the common housefly.

    Reflexes of POc _*laŋo_ ‘fly’ are both numerous and widespread, occurring in all major
subgroups. In a number of languages including Lou (Adm), Gela (SES) and Hawaiian (Pn),
the term is used in compounds as first element, referring to a range of flies (housefly, blowfly,
horsefly, March fly, bluebottle fly etc.).

7.6.2 Horseflies and March flies

Members of the horsefly and March fly families suck the blood of mammals, inflicting a
painful bite. Few terms have been collected, and no reconstructions have been possible.


7.7 Dragonflies and damselflies (Order Odonata = ‘flies with teeth’)

Dragonflies and damselflies are arguably the most acomplished aerialists in the animal kingdom. Swift
and agile, they can reverse direction in midair within one body length, hover with ease and fly backwards.
They copulate in the air, typically over a body of fresh
water, where the female lays her eggs. Although cognate sets have been elusive, a remarkable consistency
of meaning has emerged in descriptive compounds
meaning literally ‘copulate’ + ‘water’, from terms in
SE New Britain to the Solomons to Fiji. Terms referring to copulation have evidently been replaced
by euphemisms in many languages. Lack of cognacy in the
terms for water is due to the tendency in some languages to generalise terms originally referring
specifically to fresh water, rain, river, pond and so on. For instance, the second element
in the Pendau (central Sulawesi) term for a dragonfly, _tuntu/rano_, translates literally as ‘lake’
(Phil Quick pers. comm.). POc _*waiR_ ‘water’ is attested in the two following (non-cognate)
sets by terms from SES, NCV and Fiji.

   NCV: SE Ambrym  munmun-oi    ‘dragonfly’  (‘drink water’)

    Samoan retains the skimming element in _seʔe-mū_ ‘dragonfly’ (_seʔe_ ‘glide’, _mū_ ‘flying
insect’).

    The Rennellese describe it as a sailing insect: _manu-manu hogau_ (_hogau_ ‘sailor, ocean
voyager’).

    There are isolated instances of dragonflies being used in sorcery, as a means of causing death
in Kiribati (Rosemary Grimble 1972:26-27) and to facilitate theft in Tahiti (Henry 1971:391),
but rather than reflecting something specific about the role of dragonflies in POc
times, this is probably no more than an indication that certain insects were commonly regarded as
agents of the gods and spirits.

    I am unable to account for the existence of two very similar POc reconstructions for
‘wasp’, _*manipo_ and _*(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)ipo_, although presumably they are contrasted with
_*pupuk_/_*bubu_. Nor can they be divided according to their subgroups; reflexes of both appear in the
Admiralties and in the Southeast Solomons. Wandamen (SHWNG) _anibar_ ‘wasp/bee’ may
be a non-Oceanic cognate. A third group reflects Proto Central Papuan _*naniɣo_. It seems that
here we have yet another example of wordplay. It is difficult to know whether the resemblance
between _*(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)ipo_ ‘wasp’ below and _*(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)i_ ‘bee, buzzing insect’ (§8) arose by
chance or reflects common ancestry in some way.

Although sources for a number of languages give a term for ants in general, I cannot reconstruct
a POc generic. It is likely that the dominant ant species varies from place to place, and
that the term for that species has become the generic term in that area. In Yabem (NNG), for
instance, the generic term is _lêsêʔ_, in Sudest (PT) it is _vwara-vwara_, in Vitu (MM) _duri-duri_,
and in Kwaio (SES), _ta-galo_. In Wayan Fijian _kadi_ (from POc _*kadik_ ‘stinging black ant’)
has become the generic. In Niue and Tonga, _lō_ (from POc _*loRo_ ‘large red stinging ant’) is
the generic form. However, a number of POc reconstructions can be made for ant taxa.

    Rufus Pech refers to the stinging red ant of the north New Guinea coast (_lol_ in Tami) in
the following way: ‘This is perhaps the most enterprising and obviously ubiquitous species
of ant in the Melanesian lowlands. They build huge nests in trees by drawing and sticking
together bunches of leaves, are carnivorous, and defend their territory ferociously.’
(Pech 1991:91). POc _*loRo_ probably referred to this group of ants although witnesses in Eastern
Oceanic have a wider range of reference.

7.11 Termites (Order Isoptera = ‘equal wings’)

POc _*ane_ is well-supported as a term for ‘termite/white ant’. There are occasional mentions
of an association of white ants with the supernatural in SES languages. In Arosi _ane-hau_
refers to ‘k.o. white ant that lives in the ground; these ants were thought to be incarnations of
the dead’, while in Sa’a they are ‘the food of ghosts on Malapa’. However, they would have
been regarded as pests, and it is not surprising that we have no record of their ever being
referred to by a _*kali-_ term.

7.12 Crickets, grasshoppers (Order Orthoptera - ‘straightwings’); Cicadas (Order Hemiptera= ‘half wings’)

Figure 7.4: _Gryllus_ sp., cricket


If a generic term existed in POc, either for grasshoppers, or for grasshoppers + crickets + cicadas
(+ mantises), I have not been able to reconstruct it. Although I have a number of reconstructions,
their reflexes show considerable variation in gloss. Some terms refer to ‘singing insect’, which
may indicate either cricket or cicada. Lack of agreement in glosses may reflect indifference among
speakers, although I would expect a generic term if particular varieties were not seen as
important. Some languages have simply adopted verb forms for ‘grasshopper’ - etymons from Kove
(_piti-piti_ ‘jumping insect found in beach rubbish’) and Raga (_visi[ribi]_ ‘taro plant
hopper’) are from POc _*pitik_ ‘spring up suddenly’/ POc _*pitik-pitik_ jump repeatedly. In Dobu
crickets are named _kelei ʔana toeʔita_, literally ‘wallaby’s teacher’ (Ralph Lawton. pers. comm.).
A grasshopper named _kokoru-bote_ in Arosi is remarkable for the use found
for it. It is described as ‘a large grasshopper, put on one’s head to eat lice’ (from _koru_ ‘eat’,
_bote_ ‘lice’). Together with mantises and stick insects, grasshoppers and crickets are valued as
food. Kwaio has a term, _faʔafulu_ glossed as ‘generic term for edible insects, incl. grasshoppers,
stick insects etc.’ Their appeal would no doubt be as a kind of snack food, a chance
variation on their regular diet.

7.13 Mantises (Order Mantodea = ‘like a prophet’), stick insects (Order Phasmatodea = ‘like a ghost’)

398   Meredith Osmond


Although there is some confusion of gloss within cognate sets, it seems clear that POc speakers
distinguished praying mantises (_*papa_) from stick insects (_*mimis-mata_). The ability to
project a milky chemical painful to the skin which is reflected in POc _*mimis-mata_ is a defensive
mechanism of at least some stick insects (Serkan Alasya, CSIRO Entomology, pers. comm.).

  MM: Nehan        popo(hɔsoi)  ‘walking stick insect’

    POc _*mimis-mata_, literally ‘urinate’ + ‘eye’, reflects awareness that the stick insect can
eject a fluid which causes pain if it touches the eye. One of the better-known Phasmatodea
of the Oceanic region is Megacrania batesii, the pandanus stick insect.

    Closely related to stick insects are leaf insects. The only terms I have located are
descriptive compounds: Tawala (PT) _hiaga luguna_ (_hiaga_ ‘?’, _lugu_ ‘leaf’), Tongan
_moko-moko tuʔaniu_ (_moko-moko_ ‘crawling insect, _tuʔaniu_ ‘midrib of coconut leaflet’), and Rennellese
_manu gaukei_ (‘insect’ + ‘leaf’).

    Some varieties of mantis and stick insect are listed as edible in a number of languages.


7.14 Fireflies (Order Coleoptera = ‘sheath wings’: Family Lampyridae)

Judging from ethnographic references and brief elaborations in wordlists, it is fireflies, among
all the insects of the Oceanic world, which are most associated with supernatural qualities.
For Takia (NNG) speakers, a firefly, _lutot_, is thought to be a messenger of someone’s death
(Bugenhagen wordlist). The term for a firefly in Sissano (NNG), _mas eyiaw_, is a compound
term, _mas_ being defined as ‘devil; spirit of dead relative’ and _eyiaw_ as ‘evil spirit; thief’
(Whitacre wordlist). Seligmann quotes a report from Bartie Bay (Wedau, PT) that ‘if a firefly
enters a house at night, it is a sign that someone in the house will die.’ (1910:653). Molima
(PT) speakers regard fireflies as emissaries of witches who enter the house at night in order
to report back on who is there, and for that reason they are killed as soon as they are seen
(Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). In Nakanai (MM), although its speakers consider that fireflies
embody spirits of the dead, they are delighted if a firefly enters the house at night, because
it is a sign that someone recently dead is paying a visit (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). Ivens
writes that fireflies are popularly classified as ghosts in Sa’a and Ulawa (1927:189), and in
his Sa’a dictionary he defines fireflies (_pulu-pulu_) as ‘souls of dead persons’. The Tolo people
of Guadalcanal regard cicadas and fireflies as the ghosts of unknown people, or ghosts of the
forest (Ivens 1930:229). Tamambo (NCV) speakers are frightened of them, and try to avoid
them as ‘little devils’ (Dorothy Jauncey pers. comm.). In Wayan Fijian, fireflies (_tōtōvuata_)
are believed to be a sign of the gods inspecting fruit crops. The Rennellese see a firefly as the
embodiment of a goddess.

     The belief that fireflies are messengers of doom is an ancient one among Austronesian
speakers. Blust (pers. comm.) provides additional evidence from Isneg (northern Philippines)
that fireflies are precursors of death, and Karo Batak (northern Sumatra) where their presence
in a house signals that thieves will come. Of all POc reconstructions, then, I should expect that
for ‘firefly’ to be most likely to retain the _kali-_/_qali-_ indicator of supernatural status. I have
limited evidence supporting two reconstructions derived from PMP _*qali-petpet_, POc _*qali-popot_
‘firefly’ and POc _*(k,q)ali-totop_ ‘firefly’, the latter with metathesis. POc _*(k,q)ali-totop_
depends on one reflex, from Rennellese, for reconstruction of its first element and on another,
Nduke, for reconstruction of its second element.

    A putative reconstruction, POc _*bulu-bulu_ ‘firefly’, must be regarded as dubious because
witnesses are from adjoining subgroups where borrowing cannot be ruled out. Etymons may
be derived from POc _*bulut_ ‘gum’ whose reflexes can include ‘a torch (of gum)’, and thus
extend to ‘light, firefly’.

   SES: Sa’a         pulu-pulu    ‘firefly. Regarded as souls of dead persons, and killed when they enter a house’

   SES: ’Are’are     puru-puru    ‘star; firefly’
   SES: To’aba’ita   būbulu       ‘star; firefly; beetle sp.’

      Other terms use reflexes of POc _*mata_ ‘eye’, sometimes extended to ‘star’ and ‘firefly’.

7.15 Beetles (Order Coleoptera)

Although there are thousands of different beetle species, very few taxa are named in wordlists.
Only two POc reconstructions have been made, and in the first listed below there are grounds
for believing that the gloss given in many of the daughter languages is a recent adaptation.
The large rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), which bores into the crown of the coconut
palm and is considered a serious pest in many parts of the Pacific, is believed to have been
introduced from southeast Asia only in the 20th century (Gressitt & Homabrook 1985:34).
A beetle similar in appearance and behaviour is Xylotrupes gideon, found in almost all parts
of New Guinea. Presumably, speakers used an existing beetle term to refer to the introduced
beetle. The second reconstruction, POc _*kamak_, probably refers to longicorn beetles, those
with extremely long antenna (Family Cerambycidae), the larvae of which attack timber.

[8] This etymon and Bugotu _tora_ ‘to be phosphorescent’ support PGuadalcanal-Gelic _*[to]tora_
‘firefly, s.t. phosphorescent’.

    A surprising omission from most wordlists are terms for the taro beetle (Papnana uninodis).
Although these beetles may be as long-established in the region as the tubers which we
know were cultivated in Proto Oceanic times, I have not been able to reconstruct a term for
them other than Proto Southeast Solomonic _*ko[l,R]o-ko[l,R]o_ ‘beetle that attacks plants’. Damage
to the tuber is caused by the adult beetles, and not by their larval stage which feeds on soil
and roots (Robin Hide, pers. comm.). I can locate very few terms for the pest in Western
Oceanic languages, none cognate. Although damaged tubers cause significant economic loss
in today’s marketing terms, it may be that the damage was of little significance when tubers
were primarily for home consumption.

7.17 Grubs, caterpillars

Grubs and caterpillars are the larval stages of beetles (Coleoptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera).
Particular kinds are more likely to be named if they are a useful food source, or
if they attack crops.


404      Meredith Osmond


     One which is widely recognised is the edible sago grub (Order Coleoptera, family Curculionidae),
a valuable source of protein. Sago grows in low-lying, swampy areas of Melanesia
where other food plants do not thrive. Lack of the means of a varied diet may contribute
to the specialised sago grub cultivation employed by the Labu (NNG) people.[9] In Sissano
the sago grubs, _yiat_, are used in food offerings to the spirits in some healing ceremonies
(Whiteacre wordlist).

7.18 Centipedes (Class Chilopoda): Millipedes (Class Diplopoda)

Another _*qali-_ term, POc _*qalipan_ ‘centipede’, is reconstructable, probably embracing millipedes
as well. Evidence of an association between centipedes and the supernatural comes
from ethnographic descriptions as well as linguistic clues. For instance, Sengseng (NNG)
speakers consider centipedes to be supernatural beings, and carefully remove them from their
houses (Ann Chowning, pers. comm.). Elbert’s Rennellese dictionary defines _ʔagi-paipai_ as
‘centipede, considered the embodiment of non-worshipped deities and a loathsome creature’.
In his Tikopia dictionary Firth defines _morokau_ as ‘centipede. Trad. held to be frequent embodiment of spirit’. There is also a Samoan term _atua-loa_ ‘k.o. centipede with poisonous
bite’, whose prefix _atua-_ has supernatural significance (discussed in §27). In addition to the
_*qalipan_ cognate set I list non-cognate terms for centipede from a range of languages across
several subgroups which all exhibit a reflex of the _qali-_/_kali-_ prefix.

    Reflexes of _*qalipan_ are numerous and widespread. As well, I have a number of lower-level
reconstructions, possibly for particular kinds of centipede. Two kinds of centipede/millipede are
described in wordlists, categorised by behaviour or luminosity rather than number
of legs. One, when threatened, squirts a kind of acid from between its scales which can cause
blisters or even permanent eye damage, while a second is described as phosphorescent or
luminous. A millipede in Arosi (SES), _doŋa_, is also singled out as having a vile smell. I have
one lower-level reconstruction for the luminous variety, PPn _*taqe-tuli_ ‘phosphorescent centipede or millipede’, whose first element is derived from POc _*taqe_ ‘excrement’, implying
strongly that the creature is considered unpleasant in Central Pacific languages. In Tahiti,
however, where there are two kinds, not venomous, one short and thick and light brown, the
other long, threadlike and phosphorescent, they were well regarded. Teuira Henry (1971:391)
writes that ‘when a centipede fell upon a wound or bruise of any kind, it soon healed. If it
crawled upon a sick person, a speedy recovery followed.’

408   Meredith Osmond


    In Bugotu (SES) the term for a phosphorescent centipede, _liva tora_, is a literal description:
(_liva_ ‘centipede’, _tora_ ‘phosphorescent’).

    Reflexes of a reconstruction from a different semantic field, POc _*taqe_ ‘excrement’ (see
ch.2, p.60), have extended their meaning to refer to a centipede in Kahua (SES) and Bauan Fijian and a scorpion in Tamambo (NCV) and Anejom (SV), no doubt reflecting their common
characterisation as painful stinger.


7.19 Scorpions (Class Arachnida: Order Scorpiones)

A substantial number of terms for scorpions have been collected, but only a single reconstruction, Proto SE
Solomonic _*vari_ ‘scorpion’ (not listed here) has been possible. In the Solomons, many terms are compounds or
phrases which include the word for centipede (Gela _liva-ni mala_, Birao _kaukau-liva_, Lengo
_aliva-ni-ɣoro_). Although centipedes and scorpions belong to different zoological classes, the
linking of the two creatures in this way may be due to the similar appearance of grasping pincers,
and to the facts that both are capable of delivering a severe bite or sting, and both frequent the
same habitat, under rocks or leaf litter. The scorpion is named as crab-like in Gapapaiwa
(_gʷaɣa-gʷaɣa_ ‘scorpion; idiom for one who moves slowly and fearfully on heights) (_gʷaɣa_ ‘crab (generic)’)
and possibly also in Molima (_dowa_ ‘scorpion, land crab’), although Chowning adds a question mark to her gloss.

Figure 7.8: _Honnurus_ sp., scorpion

7.20 Spiders (Order Araneae)

Although POc speakers would undoubtedly have named a range of spiders, I have not been
able to link reconstructions with specific kinds of spider. I have only one lower-level example
in which a name is assigned to a particular spider — PCP _*tuku-tuku_ ‘k.o. spider that lets itself
down by a single thread’. POc _*lawaq_, traceable back to PAn, with cognates right across
the Oceanic region, may have referred primarily to ‘spider’ but by POc times had come to
refer as well to ‘spider web’ and ‘k.o. fish net’ (see vol.1, p.212). I also find a number of
reconstructions with formal similarities, including POc _*koko_, POc _*gagao_~_*(g,k)a(g,k)a-_,
PWOc _*kuku_, and PEOc _*[ko]ko-miji. Some kind of word play has evidently taken place,
although I have no ethnographic evidence that particular spiders are associated with any kind
of supernatural belief or taboo. On the contrary, they are freely eaten in many communities.
Wordlists of a number of languages including Molima and Sinaugoro (PT), Takia (NNG) and
Hawaiian (Pn), record particular kinds of edible spider.

    Reconstructions other than _*lawaq_ have an unusually large number of reflexes which are
compounds with a non-reflected element. These reconstructions may refer to particular kinds
of spider. As Pawley (2000: 8) has noted, names for folk specifics in plants and animals, or, to
be more exact, the secondary or modifying terms in binomials, are notoriously unstable and
will, in most cases, not be reconstructable for a language as remote in time as POc.

    POc _*koko_ and PWOc _*kuku_ may be variants of the same term as _*kaka_. Two alternate
hypotheses about their origins are (a) that _*ko_ reflects the second syllable of _*gagao_, and
(b) that the reflexes supporting _*kaka-_, _*koko_ and _*kuku_ reflect POc _*kʷakʷa_. Evidence for
(b) is that (i) SE Solomonic languages retain _k-_ and this is diagnostic of POc _*kʷ-_, and (ii)
Western Oceanic (PT, MM) reflexes other than Simbo retain _k-_ rather than leniting it to _ɣ-_ or
zero, the usual reflexes of _*k-_.

    POc _*koko_ becomes _*[ko]ko-miji_ ‘k.o. spider’ in PSES with the addition of _-miji_ an
element which occurs also in other compounds meaning ‘spider’ (Dori’o [SES] _kala-midi_)
although not found separately. It also may occur in Nakanai _kamimisi_ ‘spider’, if intepreted
as _kami-misi_ with _kami-_ < _kali_ by assimilation. I am unable to suggest a meaning for POc
_*-miji_, other than to note that I have found it only in spider terms.

7.21 Leeches (Class Hirudinea)

There is a well-supported POc reconstruction for ‘leech’ based on reflexes in NNG, PT and
NCV languages. I have not so far located any term for leech, cognate or otherwise, east of Fiji,
and assume that the creatures are not found in Micronesia or Polynesia (with the exception of
New Zealand, where the Maori term is _ŋata_ i.e. ‘snake’) (Ross Clark, pers. comm.). Pawley
has reconstructed a similar term, Proto Remote Oceanic _*drumane_ ‘anemone’ (ch.4, §6.1) which is almost in
complementary distribution, and the terms may be related.

7.22 Worms

7.22.1 Worm (generic)

There is a widespread belief among Austronesian speakers that dental caries is caused by a
small worm. Both the creature and the associated condition are named in different languages
by reflexes of various reconstructed terms for ‘worm’. Blust comments on two WMP languages,
Cebuano and Malagasy, whose reflexes of PAn _*qulej_ ‘maggot’ refer also to ‘tooth
decay’ or ‘toothache, supposed to be occasioned by a small worm in the tooth’ (ACD) (§23).
Dobu (PT) has a term _kimʷata_ ‘the supposed insect which causes caries in children’ (_mʷata_
‘snake’). The To’aba’ita term is _wā-lifo_ ‘tooth decay, believed to be caused by worms’ (_wā_
‘worm, grub, maggot, caterpillar, larva’, _lifo_ ‘tooth’). Other WMP languages refer to tooth
decay by reflexes of PMP _*bukbuk_ ‘weevil that infests wood, bamboo, and rice; dust produced by
the boring of this insect; tooth decay’ (ACD) (§9). Codrington also reports the belief
as existing in the Banks Islands (NCV) (1891:193).

    It seems likely that POc _*mʷata-mʷata_, the reduplicated form of _*mʷata_ ‘snake’, was a
generic for worms and worm-like creatures, including caterpillars and millipedes. In places
it has reverted to its unreduplicated form, either as a generic for snakes and other snake-like
creatures, or, as in Micronesia and Seimat, to refer to worms alone. In Micronesia there are
no snakes except on Guam, where they have been introduced in comparatively recent times
(Jeff Marck, pers. comm.), and hence there is no need to maintain the distinction. I have not
been able to ascertain if snakes are found in the Ninigo Islands, where Seimat is spoken.

7.22.2 Other worm taxa

Blust has reconstructed PMP _*bulati_ ‘roundworm, ascaris, intestinal worm; also earthworm?’
(ACD) without Oceanic reflexes. I have reconstructed POc _*sulati_ ‘worm’ which evidently
carries a common root, _-lati_. The Oceanic evidence does not permit further differentiation of
meaning.

    The next reconstruction, PNGOc _*dimʷan_ ‘k.o. worm’, bears some similarity to POc
_*droman_ ‘leech’ but a contrast is preserved in some languages, e.g. Molima _domana_ ‘mountain leech’,
_dimʷa-mʷana_ ‘worm’; Dobu _domana_ ‘leech’, _di-dimʷana_ ‘common earthworms,
small lizards’; Gapapaiwa _domani_ ‘leech’, _dimo(moga)_ ‘earthworm’; Sinaugoro _doma_ ‘leech’,
_dimo_ ‘worm’). The resemblance appears to be accidental.

    The next reconstruction illustrates what was evidently a productive process in POc, the
addition of _-a(n)_ to a term X, where X could be water, sennit, people, pigs etc., to indicate a
state of being ‘full of X’ or in the case of insects, infested with the insect. Besides POc
_*qulos-a(n)_ ‘be maggoty’
I can reconstruct PEOc _*kutu-a(n)_ ‘(be) lousy’ (To’aba’ita _ʔu-la_, Samoan _ʔutu-a_,
Pukapukan _wutu-a_). Further examples from SES languages show the process applied
to other insect names: Sa’a _pote_ ‘head louse’, _pote-la_ ‘lousy’; To’aba’ita, Lau _wā_ ‘maggot,
worm’, _wā-la_ ‘maggoty, wormy’, and I add a Polynesian example, Tongan _moŋomoŋa-ʔia_
‘infested with beetles or cockroaches’, from _moŋomoŋa_ ‘any kind of beetle or cockroach’.

7.25 Semantic extensions and generalisations

Chapter 8 contains a detailed examination of _*manuk_ and _*manu-manuk_. POc _*manuk_ evidently had two
senses, one restricted, the other extended. The restricted sense was ‘bird’
or more precisely ‘bird + bat’, hence ‘flying vertebrate’. The extended sense was ‘creature’,
probably excluding people and things that swam in the sea. In POc, diminutives were regularly
formed by reduplication. So _*manu-manuk_ meant either ‘small flying creature’, or
simply ‘small creature’. Beyond that I have only fragments of information to go on as clues
to how POc speakers classified their world of insects and other creepy-crawlies. It is likely
that most languages had generic terms for butterflies, flies, spiders, hoppers, ants, grubs and
so on, although I have been able to reconstruct reliable generic terms for only the first two.

     There is some evidence that there were two broader categories in PPn, the flying creatures,
_*manu-lele_ and the crawlers, _*manu-totolo_. Rennellese has _manu-manu-gege_
‘flying/jumping creatures’, and _manu-manu-totogo_ ‘creeping creatures’, the latter including reptiles
other than turtles. Nanumea, a dialect of Tuvalu (Pn), has forms cognate with the Rennellese,
_manu lele_ ‘bird, flying insect’ and _manu totolo_ ‘ground animal e.g. spider, lizard, land
mammal’. Niue also has cognate terms but insects are excluded in both: _manu lele_ ‘bird, can
include flying fox but not flying insects’ and _manu totolo_ ‘any walking or crawling creature
but not insects’. Speakers of the Hula dialect of Keapara (Papuan Tip) distinguish _manu-manu_
‘flying insect’ and _mani-mani_ ‘creeping insect’. According to Fox (1974), Lau (SES)
divides the entire animal kingdom three ways, with _wāwā_ ‘generic for all creatures in or
on the ground’, _manu_ ‘generic for all creatures that fly’ and _iʔa_ ‘generic for all creatures in
water’.

418     Meredith Osmond


    In some Polynesian languages, small lizards and certain other creepy crawlies are lumped
together in a higher order taxon. POc _*mʷata-mʷata_ ‘worm’ is the diminutive of _*mʷata_
‘snake’.[11] Note also Dobu (PT) _didi mʷana_ ‘common earthworms, small lizards’.

    Similarities in behaviour form the basis of other groupings. In Tamambo (NCV), the reflex
    of POc _*(ñ,n)opuq_ ‘stonefish’ refers to ‘centipede or scorpion’ as well as ‘venomous
fish’. The semantic link is clearly ‘painful stinger’. The Polynesian language of Rennell has
extended the meaning of _kutu_ (from POc _*kutu_ ‘head louse’) to refer to ‘louse, bird louse,
mite, leech and tiny insects of various kinds’. The term has presumably come to mean ‘small
blood-sucker’, when no more specific reference is necessary. In Marquesan the reflex of POc
_*quloc_ ‘maggot’, _iʔo_, now refers to bugs and worms.

    Some languages have developed and named unusual groupings. For instance, the Motu
have a term, _kikiri kikiri_, which refers to ‘all creatures which live on the ground but jump or
fly short distances. Cicadas and hawk moths are _kikiri kikiri_. So are beetles that make noise’
(Nigel Oram n.d.). In Kwaio, there is a collective term, _faʔa_/_fulu_, for edible insects.


7.26 Stability and variability of terms

A small number of POc insect names show far greater stability than others. In a survey of 25
dictionaries chosen on comprehensiveness and whose languages together covered all major
subgroups,[12] reflexes of _*kutu_ ‘louse’ were listed in 23, _*laŋo_ ‘fly’ in 22, _*ñamuk_ ‘mosquito’
in 21, _*bebek_ ‘butterfly’ in 16, and _*qapator_ ‘sago grub, edible’ in 13. In an email comment
on seahorse terms Robert Blust wrote that ‘The general principle for flora and fauna seems
to be that if it was economically useful or dangerous it was named, and the more useful
or dangerous the more stable the name historically.’[13] With insects, it seems that the more
intrusive in everyday life, the more commonplace and either pesky or valued they are, the
more likely they are to be known by highly stable terms.

    In contrast, it seems that unstable terms may be unstable for a variety of reasons. We
have a number of instances where it has proved very difficult to make any well-supported
reconstructions, and others where two or more reconstructions that differ only very slightly
in form have been made for an insect. Examples are:

The existence of taboo to limit use of a particular form to a particular area, has already been
suggested for ‘butterfly’ in §3, and may explain why this creature can have a name that is
very stable in most of the Oceanic region, yet be unstable in parts of Western Oceanic.

    Clearly, onomatopoeia plays a role in the naming of the humming and buzzing insects,
where there is frequent interchange of _n_, _ñ_ and _ŋ_. Examples include POc _*ñamuk_,
PWOc _*ŋati-ŋati_, both ‘mosquito’,  POc _*ŋiŋi(ŋ)_ (1) ‘buzz as a mosquito’, (2) ‘mosquito’,
_*(n,ñ)i(n,ñ)i_ ‘bee, buzzing insect’.

    Irregular patterning of terms for insects has been attributed to the fact that many insects
are ‘expressive’ creatures. That is, they are associated with particular characteristics that
impinge strongly on the human sensory system and become a significant identifying feature for
that insect. Characteristics include sound (crickets, cicadas, the buzzing insects), movement
(grasshoppers, butterflies, spiders), ability to sting or bite (mosquitoes, sandflies and other
stinging flies, centipedes, scorpions, ants) and possibly other aspects of appearance or behaviour. It has been claimed that it is their ‘expressive’ condition that underlies a tendency
for speakers to play phonological games with their names, resulting in irregularities that may
then defy reconstruction. This tendency has been observed cross-linguistically by Erik Fudge (1970)
in words of certain semantic type including onomatopoeia or movement, and in the
names of plants and animals in Balinese and the closely related Javanese by Adrian Clynes (1995:44).


7.27 The supernatural element

Among my POc reconstructions, those carrying the _*kali-_/_*qali-_ prefix are limited to
_*[kali]-bobo(ŋ)_ ‘butterfly’, _*qalipan_ ‘centipede’ and _*qali-popot_/_*(k,q)ali-totop_
‘firefly’. Ethnographic evidence from a number of communities indicates that all three creatures retain some
supernatural association requiring them to be treated with caution. I also have a number of
reconstructions at POc level or lower which may carry the prefix or some trace of it. They
include PPn _*kalisi_ ‘cicada, cricket’, a number of ant terms possibly reflecting POc _*kal(a,o)_,
two lizard terms, PSOc _*qala_ ‘green lizard, _Emoia_ sp.’, PEOc _*kalis(i,u)_ ‘skink, k.o. lizard’
(see ch.5, §5.3.5), and a number of terms for ‘spider’ which carry the prefix _ka-_.[14] However,
if my reconstructions do in fact carry a trace of the danger prefix, they have lost what was
evidently an essential element of _*kali-_/_*qali-_ words at a stage earlier than POc, that is, conversion
from the typical disyllabic base form to a quadrisyllable one. The prefix had ceased
to be productive in POc.

[14] Cf. Blust’s (2001b: 37) list of creatures marked with the prefix which include, inter alia, grasshopper, gecko, some ant
 spp. and some spider spp..

420    Meredith Osmond


     Nonetheless, it seems that in Polynesian languages there is a different term which can be
used to mark a creature as supernatural. PPn _*qatua_ (from PMP _*qatuari_), often glossed ‘god,
deity’, is used primarily to signify that an object, whether human or non-human, has supernatural
qualities. In Williams’ Maori dictionary, the definition of _atua_ runs ‘god, demon, supernatural being,
ghost; object of superstitious regard; anything malign, disagreeable; strange,
extraordinary’.[15] Like _qali-_/_kali-_, its range in Polynesian languages extends to inexplicable
phenomena such as rainbows and waterspouts.[16]

     Examples of its use in Polynesia include Maori _atua-piko_ ‘rainbow’ (cf PT: Kilivila
_kali-pedoga_ ‘rainbow’), Tongan _ʔotua-kui_ ‘whirlwind, waterspout’ (cf MM: Nakanai _kali-vuru_
‘tornado, waterspout’ and MM: Tolai _kali-vuvur_ ‘whirlwind’), and a small number of insect terms,
Samoan _atua-loa_ ‘k.o. centipede with poisonous bite’ (cf POc _*qali-pan_  ‘centipede’) Maori _pepe atua_
‘northern wattle moth’ (literally ‘supernatural butterfly’) (cf. POc
_*[kali]bobo(ŋ)_ ‘butterfly’) and two Rennellese terms, _ʔatua segesege baʔe_ ‘a large grasshopper’
(lit. ‘leg-cutting supernatural’) and _ʔatua-seu_ ‘large stinging stick insect’ (lit. ‘lame supernatural’).

     A detailed account of the way in which _atua_ is linked to natural species in one community is
given by Firth (1967:233). In Tikopia, as in other Polynesian communities, _atua_
applies primarily to a supernatural object, whether human or non-human in form. However,
it is applied also to any natural species which should not be eaten. ‘The terms _atua_ and _kai_
(food) in this connection are in fact mutually exclusive. The [former] applies to small crabs,
sea anemones, bêche-de-mer and other marine creatures on the reef, as well as to iridescent
lizards, spiders and some insects.’ (p.233). He suggests
‘_that the connotation of _atua_ as inedible may be derivative from its significance of supernatural’
(p.234), (italics mine, MO). He
concludes that  ‘one point, however, may be stressed with certainty, that any object which is
regarded as an _atua_ may not be eaten, and anything which is fit for human consumption cannot be
in itself an _atua_ — though it may … become temporarily associated with _atua_’ (p.234).
Among the creatures he lists as _atua_ are two inedible crabs, _kaviki_ ‘small pale land crab’ and
_karamisi_ ‘reddish-brown or yellowish crab, [which] lives in crotch of tree’ (cf
PMP _*qali-maŋaw_ ‘mangrove crab’). Also _atua_ are _moko_, the black lizard, and _morokau_, the centipede.
In Tikopia, then, _atua_ is not affixed to the names of natural species as it is in other Polynesian
communities and in the manner of _qali-_/_kali-_, but is rather the name of a category.

     The association of certain insects with the supernatural has survived from PAn society
right through to certain contemporary Polynesian societies. Although the _qali-_/_kali-_ label has
evidently lost its force in Oceanic languages, the existence of reflexes of _*qatuan_ in a similar
capacity is a revealing linguistic clue to certain beliefs of POc speakers.

[15] As the breadth of the Maori definition illustrates, the result of the long association of
supernatural qualities with certain creatures has led to its interpretation in a number of
different ways, not all of them compatible with Blust’s ‘danger: avoid’ message for PMP _*qali-_.
In Rennellese (Pn), _mogi ʔatua_ refers to a ‘useless orange’, perhaps an extension of meaning
from ‘dangerous’ > ‘poisonous’ > merely ‘inedible’.

[16] Jeff Marck (1994) reconstructs PMic _*auniari_ ‘whirlwind, waterspout’, based on, among
others, Ponapean _einiar_ ‘whirlwind’, Mortlockese _awúniyar_ ‘whirlwind, tornado, rainbow’,
Carolinian _(l)ayúliyáy_ ‘tornado’. Woleaian (r)aúriyaza ‘rainbow’, Ulithian _(l)olyor_ ‘rainbow’.
He comments: ‘This may be analysable as _*au-ni-ari_ ‘atmosphere-of-?’ where _*-ari_ had some as
yet unreconstructed meaning along the lines of ‘troublesome, fearful’ or whatever’ (p.310).




8 Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic? Semantic reconstruction and change in some terms for animal categories in Oceanic languages

|       them all the name of fishes, it is wisest to conform. (Oliver Goldsmith, ca 1760)


8.1 Introduction

8.1.1 Aims

This chapter investigates the semantic histories of five Proto Oceanic terms, _*ikan_, _*pinaŋoda_,
_*sisiq_, _*manuk_ and _*manu-manuk_, each of which is a candidate for the status of a high-level
generic or ‘life form’ in the POc taxonomy of animals.[1] In certain contemporary Oceanic
languages reflexes of _*ikan_ have a range of reference that encompasses fish and other large
water-dwelling animals (cetaceans, dugongs, turtles and crocodiles), reflexes of _*pinaŋoda_
encompass reef invertebrates, or sea animals other than fish and large water-dwelling animals,
reflexes of _*sisiq_ refer to gastropod (snail-like) shellfish, reflexes of _*manuk_ refer to
birds and bats, and reflexes of _*manu-manuk_ to insects and other creepy-crawlies (spiders,
centipedes, worms, etc.). However, in other Oceanic languages these etyma have reflexes
with quite different ranges of reference. For example, in some cases the _*manuk_ reflex includes
not just birds and bats but all flying creatures, in others it includes all land-dwelling
creatures or all creatures other than humans, in still others it includes humans, and there are
some where it includes all objects. In many languages the _sisiq_ reflex refers just to a small
class of small gastropods (nerites and similar) while in others it includes all gastropods or all
shellfish.

[1] I am indebted to Frank Lichtenberk, John Lynch, Meredith Osmond, Malcolm Ross and Anna Wierzbicka
 for valuable comments on a draft of this paper, to John Lynch for pointing to additional Vanuatu and New
 Caledonian comparisons, and to Paul Geraghty, Frank Lichtenberk and the late Nigel Oram, for providing
 information about the generic terms for ‘fish’ in Standard Fijian, To’aba’ita and Motu, respectively.

    The aim here is to determine, as far as possible, the range of reference of these five terms
in POc, their place in the taxonomy, and the nature of the changes that have occurred in
daughter languages. The task of reconstructing their semantic histories raises some questions
of more general interest: Are the variations in the meanings of major generics across daughter
languages random or do they follow an implicational scale, a natural sequence of semantic
extension or contraction? Why have such marked differences arisen in the semantic scope of
these terms? Can some of the changes be attributed, for example, to differences in the range
of animal life encountered by different communities?


8.1.2 Methodological preliminaries

Before we examine the Oceanic terms in question it is necessary to discuss some issues of
method and conceptual framework. The semantics of folk taxonomies is a notoriously tricky
domain, not one that one should enter without a map.

    A first consideration is the nature of the analytic apparatus needed to make sense of folk
taxonomies and the task of choosing between competing frameworks. This leads into questions about
how different kinds of classificatory terms differ in their semantic structure and
their role in the taxonomy. Another concern, of a more practical kind, relates to which kinds
of semantic information, which components of lexical meaning it is feasible to deal with when
trying to reconstruct the semantic history of classificatory terms. Finally, there is the problem
that most definitions of classificatory terms in Oceanic dictionaries, our main sources of data,
suffer from serious shortcomings.

8.1.2.1 What are taxonomies?

A well-formed taxonomy is a system of semantic relations between lexical units that has the
following properties:[2] (i) Certain taxa stand in a class-inclusion or superordinate-hyponym
relation. Thus, the statement _X is a fox terrier_ unilaterally entails that _X is a dog_, which in turn
entails _X is an animal_. That is, _fox terrier_ is a hyponym of _dog_, which in turn is a hyponym
of _animal_, (ii) Certain lexical units stand in a relation of incompatibility or contrast. Thus the
statement _X is a fox terrier_ entails _X is not a labrador, alsatian or poodle_, and the statement
_X is a dog_ entails _X is not a cat, seal or bear_, (iii) the hyponyms of a term X are
_natural kinds_ of X. Thus, it can be said that _a fox terrier is a kind of dog_ and
_a dog is a kind of animal_. A natural kind typically has many defining features (see §1.2.2) but all other features
are subordinate to the one that defines its place in the taxonomy, the fact that it is a kind of
something (a sparrow is a kind of bird, a dog is a kind of animal, a trout is a kind of fish).

    The relation implied by ‘natural kind’ is not identical to ‘class-inclusion’ or ‘hyponymy’.
Not all hyponyms are natural kinds. Some are ‘nominal kinds’, e.g. _spinster_, _bachelor_, _mare_,
_ewe_, _ram_. Unlike natural kinds, contrasts between nominal kinds can be readily defined,
approximately, in an analytic way in terms of just a few features, e.g.
_bachelor = man who has never married_, _spinster = woman who has never married_,
_ewe = adult female sheep_, _ram = adult male sheep_. It follows that the semantic difference
between nominal hyponyms
of the same set can be expressed analytically, as e.g. the difference between _bachelor_ and
_spinster_ or _ram_ and _ewe_. It is not a dominant feature of nominal terms that they are kinds of
something. Although one can say _a spinster is a woman_, _a mare is a horse_, _a ram is a sheep_
it is questionable whether it makes sense to say _a spinster is a kind of woman_,
_a mare is a kind of horse_, or _a ram is a kind of sheep_.

[2] The discussion that follows draws heavily on Cruse (1986) and Wierzbicka (1984, 1996).

                                                           Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic?   423


8.1.2.2 Defining natural kinds

Natural kinds cannot readily be defined analytically. For example, the difference between _dog_
and _bird_ cannot be reduced to one or two distinguishing features: the two differ in indefinitely
many ways. It is not clear how one should answer a question like:
_What is the meaning of dog_? Apart from mentioning that dogs are a kind of animal, should a definition say that they
have four legs and a tail, are furry, are carnivorous, bark and howl, have a very keen sense of
smell, are pack animals, that people have selectively bred them to create many breeds, and
keep them as pets, and for hunting game, rounding up sheep and cattle, and guarding property,
that they are not eaten (at least in English-speaking societies), and so on? What about
the meaning of ‘bird’? Should a definition mention all and only the universally valid morphological
attributes, that birds have feathers and two legs, two wings (some only vestigial) and
a beak, and that they lay eggs? Which if any behavioural characteristics should it mention:
that birds typically fly (not all do), that they make nests (not all do), that they have diverse
calls, that many male and female pairs mate for life, that they are typically wild creatures but
some species are domesticated, and so on?

     Dictionary-makers typically baulk at the task of defining all the things that may distinguish
natural kinds and are content to pick out just a few salient characteristics. For example,
_The Macquarie Dictionary_ defines _dog_, in its primary sense, as ‘a domesticated carnivore,
Canis familiaris, bred in a great many varieties’. The definition of _cat_ is almost identical,
save for the Latin name: ‘a domesticated carnivore, Felis domestica (or _F. catus_), widely
distributed in a number of breeds’. And dictionary definitions of terms of folk generic and
life-form rank largely reflect scientific knowledge, not folk knowledge. Macquarie defines
bird as ‘any of the Aves, a class of warm-blooded vertebrates, having a body more or less
completely covered with feathers, and the forelimbs modified so as to form wings by which
means most species fly’. As Anna Wierzbicka has repeatedly pointed out, such definitions
are quite unsatisfactory as an account of folk knowledge about what these kinds of animals
are.

8.1.2.3 The taxonomic ranks and naming principles proposed by Berlin (1992)

Folk taxonomies must have at least two levels but can have many levels, as indicated by the
sequence: _berkshire_ > _pig_ > _animal_ > _creature_, or _pinnacle floribunda_ > _floribunda rose_ >
_rose_ > _flower_ > _plant_. One way of distinguishing the levels is to refer to them as primary,
secondary, tertiary, etc. or as first-order, second-order, third-order, etc.


424   Andrew Pawley


    Instead of speaking of levels in a folk taxonomy in this way, Brent Berlin and his associates
propose that taxa at each level be given rank status in a way that broadly parallels the
taxonomic ranks of Western biology (Berlin 1992, Berlin et al. 1973). Building on earlier
work, Berlin (1992) also specifies some general principles of nomenclature. While the system of
naming practices is distinct from the taxonomy, the two are systematically related so
that we can often infer the taxonomic relations between particular taxa from the way they
are named. A key nomenclatural distinction is between _uninomials_ (or _primary lexemes_) and
_binomials_ (or _secondary lexemes_). Binomials are multiword names in which one element
modifies the head noun, and where the head noun can stand alone as a generic name, e.g.
_rock crab_, _mud crab_, _hammerhead shark_, _white-pointer shark_). A uninomial consists of a
single morpheme, such as _herring_ or _perch_, or a compound or phrase that is idiomatic, such
as the type of _hammerhead_ or _leatherjacket_, where no element can stand alone as a generic
term (there is no category of fish called _head_ or _jacket_), or the type of _sea hare_, _sea cow_ and
_seahorse_ (the creatures so named are not a kind of _hare_, _cow_ or _horse_).

     The following is a summary of the system of rank distinctions in folk taxonomies, and
generalisations about nomenclature given in Berlin (1992).

     Most taxa belong to one of three ranks: _life form_, _folk generic_ or _folk specific_.

     __Life-form__. A life-form is a taxon that (i) distinguishes a distinctive morphotype which
(ii) includes many (sometimes hundreds) of lower order taxa which share the characteristic
morphology and ecological adaptation of the type, (iii) is not included in any other taxon
other than kingdom, and (iv) is named by a uninomial. Examples of English life-form taxa
are _fish_, _bird_, _snake_, _tree_ and _flower_. The nature of categories that rank as life-forms may vary
across speech communities, usually in ways connected with regional differences in flora and
fauna and in the ways of life of communities. For example, for people in the central Pacific,
shellfish are a much more numerous and more important category than snakes, or even birds,
but the reverse is the case in many regions of the world.

     __Folk generic__. A folk generic (or folk genus) is a ‘natural’ category in several senses,
one perceptual, the others linguistic. First, the members of this category are usually marked
off from non-members by multiple characters of morphology and behaviour or ecological
adaptation that will be evident to any close observer. Second, unlike folk species, the category
is named by a uninomial rather than a binomial. Examples of English folk generics are _rose_,
_oak_, _beech_, _blackbird_, _pig_, _dog_, _frog_, _toad_, _mullet_, _trout_, _whale_, _crocodile_.
Third, the folk generic is the usual way of referring to a particular plant or animal if its
identity is known.
Depending on various factors, a folk genus may correspond to a single species in biological
taxonomies, to a number of species or a genus, or to a number of genera or families. Many folk
generics are subtaxa of life forms but Berlin recognises a category of unaffiliated generics,
first-order taxa that do not belong to any life-form but are not themselves life-forms.

     __Folk species__. A folk genus sometimes further divides into folk species (or folk specifics),
usually just a few taxa which contrast in a limited number of features with other members
of the generic. Such specifics are usually the lowest-level taxa. Berlin (1992) holds that folk
species names usually consist of the generic name plus a modifier, e.g. _red mullet_ vs
_grey mullet_, or _mako shark_ vs _hammerhead shark_. Bulmer (1970, 1974), however, finds that a fair
number of animal folk species, among the Kalam people of the New Guinea highlands, are
named by primary lexemes (uninomials).

     Three other ranks are sometimes distinguished in folk taxonomies.

     __Kingdom__. A single primary (first-order) taxon - one that subsumes all life-form taxa and
other taxa in the relevant semantic domain or class. Names for taxa of kingdom rank will be
uninomials. For some English speakers, whose perceptions have been influenced by scientific
taxonomies, _plant_ and _animal_ qualify as kingdom rank taxa, subsuming various life forms. In
vernacular speech, traditionally, these two terms have narrower meanings. However, in most
societies, folk classifications of living things lack overt taxa of kingdom rank.

                                                          Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic?         425


    __Intermediate__. A taxon which (i) is a member of a life-form (and so is never a first-order
taxon) and (ii) comprises a small number of folk generics that show marked similarities to
each other and often correspond to botanical or zoological families. If an intermediate taxon
has a name, it will be a uninomial. However, Berlin says that intermediate taxa are generally
not named, i.e. they are usually ‘covert taxa’, whose unity is indicated by other means than
sharing a class name. For some English speakers, _horses_, _zebras_ and _donkeys_ form such a
covert category, as do _hawks_, _falcons_ and _eagles_.

    __Varietal__. Under certain conditions, folk species can divide into lower order taxa,
contrasting in subtle ways with other varieties. Distinctions between varietal taxa mainly apply
to domesticated plants and animals - and so may be motivated mainly by cultural considerations. The names are usually compounds.

    For larger animals and some kinds of plants, at the level of the genus and often at the
level of the species, the distinctions made by communities living close to nature tend to be
similar to those made by Western biologists. The similarities at the genus/species levels are
usually explained as follows. These categories are marked by many distinctive features and
are as obvious to any close observer of nature as they are to highly trained biologists.

    At higher levels the methods and motives underpinning folk and scientific classifications
tend to diverge and therefore so do the categories. The higher you go, either in a folk taxonomy or
a scientific taxonomy, the less the taxa are likely to conform to ‘natural kinds’. Western
biologists aim to capture the evolutionary relationships of organisms, a concern peculiar
to science. Ordinary people, on the other hand, impose higher order categories on cultural
grounds, be they pragmatic or cosmological. Sometimes the grounds for grouping different
kinds of organisms are broad likenesses in form and behaviour. For example, it is fairly common to
find a taxon that subsumes both birds and bats, or both fish and whales. In other cases,
social factors (e.g. ritual restrictions and taboos) and technological or economic factors (e.g.
techniques used to obtain or process foods) peculiar to a society influence the grouping.

8.1.2.4 Taxonomic generics vs collectives

Wierzbicka (1984, 1996) has advanced methodological objections to certain claims made by
anthropologists, linguists and psychologists about the nature and membership of categories
in folk taxonomies. She points out that people’s intuitions about category membership can’t
reliably be established by asking them simple questions like ‘Is X a kind of Y?’ or by asking
them to sort cards with pictures. Instead you need to find out how people talk spontaneously
about such matters and to apply a variety of linguistic tests designed to bring out people’s
tacit knowledge.[3]

[3] Berlin (1992) and Wierzbicka (1994, 1996) argue strongly against the position taken by some commentators
 that a hierarchy of kinds is absent from or marginal to folk biological classifications.

426    Andrew Pciwley


    Wierzbicka has argued persuasively for a distinction between true generic taxonomic
terms and collectives, a distinction that will prove to be relevant to our discussion of Oceanic
generics. For her, collectives are not taxonomic terms, at least not in the same sense as true
generics. She discusses the properties of English terms like _animal_, _bird_, _fish_ and _flower_, in
popular speech, that clearly mark them as being ‘super taxonomic categories’, or ‘life forms’.
Each of these terms stands for kinds of things that are alike, a category based on perceptual
similarities, something you can draw a picture of schematically, something you can count
individually. She contrasts taxonomic generics with collectives like _livestock_, _game (animals)_,
_fruit_, _grass_, _vegetables_, _cutlery_ and _furniture_. Unlike true generics, these don’t stand
for kinds of things that are alike. A collective is a heterogeneous collection of kinds that share
a common function or some other feature(s). Wierzbicka says that you can draw a generalised
picture of a fish or bird but not a generalised picture of fruit or cutlery. One can have an
exchange such as _Look at that colourful fish there_? - _Which one_? - _The one with yellow stripes_,
but _Look at that big livestock there_? - _Which one_? - _The brown and white one_, is bizarre. You
can’t count individual objects using a collective: _*I saw one fruit/livestock/furniture/cutlery_.
_I saw one fruit_ is only acceptable in a more abstract sense: _I saw one kind of fruit_, not in the
sense _I saw one individual fruit_ (e.g. _one apple_)

    This distinction between natural kinds and collectives will prove to be relevant in our
discussion of Oceanic generics.


8.1.2.5 Problems inherent in the semantics of generics

For any generic term, the assumption that there is a single correct definition of its semantic
range that can be uncovered by careful research is itself questionable. The fact is that members
of a speech community often do not agree completely as to the scope of generics. The kind
of variation is of the kind predicted by prototype theory (Rosch 1973, 1975a,b). Generally
people agree on the membership of typical members of a class but disagree when it comes
to marginal members. The definitions given in dictionaries tend to understate the amount of
variation within the speech community.

    Consider, for example, English speakers’ use of the term _fish_. The
_Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED)_ makes a sharp distinction between popular and
scientific definitions of this term.

|       __Fish 1__. In [popular] language, any animal living exclusively in water, including cetaceans,
|       crustaceans, molluscs, etc. In scientific language any vertebrate animal provided with
|       gills throughout life, and cold-blooded: the limbs, if present being modified into fins.

     Johnson’s definition and Goldsmith’s observations, quoted at the head of this chapter,
show the prevalence of this popular usage in 18th century England. However, a mere two-way
contrast between popular and scientific usage is surely an over-simplification. A survey
of several hundred Australian informants shows that while everyone agrees on including
prototypical fish there is much variation in regard to what other creatures count as fish. Some
English speakers exclude eels, sharks, rays, seahorses and certain other ‘atypical’ fish from
this category while others include whales and dolphins and even crayfish and jellyfish.

     A similar problem arises with ‘shellfish’. Most English dictionaries give definitions similar to the following, taken from the _SOED_.

|       __shellfish__ any animal living in water whose outer covering is a shell, whether testaceous,
|       as an oyster, or crustaceous, as a crab.

The problem here is that for many native speakers of English, especially those who are not
from the USA, _shellfish_ refers only to edible molluscs with shells and does not include crabs,
lobsters and prawns.


                                                               Were turtlesfish in Proto Oceanic?           427


    A further difficulty is that directly questioning informants about classification - ‘Are
butterflies a kind of insect?’, ‘Are eels a kind of fish?’ - is likely to yield unreliable answers.
While these are legitimate questions there are other, more reliable ways of getting
at class membership. One such consists of spontaneous utterances that contain information
about class membership: ‘What a beautiful insect! Is it a beetle?’, ‘Kiwis are strange-looking
birds’. Lexical evidence is another valuable source, e.g. is it possible, or usual for a referent
to be named by a true binomial expression, consisting of a generic with an identifying modifier:
_sulphur-crested cockatoo_, _rock cod_, _oak tree_, _white pine_, _grey wolf_? Unacceptability or
unacceptability of particular logical relations is yet another useful test. Thus, _I saw cats and dogs_
is an acceptable conjunction in English but _I saw animals and dogs_ is not. All English
speakers would probably accept _They netted ten fish and a turtle_, while rejecting
_They netted ten fish, including two turtles_. But _They netted ten fish and two eels_ or
_They netted ten fish and two sharks_ might yield diverse judgments.

     It is important to recognize that speakers often distinguish two or more senses of generic
terms, some with narrower reference, others with wider reference. English _animal_ is an example.
There are some contexts, in popular speech, where _animal_ denotes a category that
includes, roughly, mammals, four-legged reptiles and frogs but not birds, fish or invertebrates.
There are other contexts where it includes all creatures other than humans. And there
are still other contexts where it includes humans (‘Humans are different from the rest of the
animal kingdom’).


8.1.2.6 A modest objective

Although I see the merit of Wierzbicka’s argument that definitions of a folk category should
try to capture as fully as possible folk perceptions and knowledge about that category, the
data to hand for Oceanic languages do not allow us to pursue such an objective (see §1.2.7).
My concern with definitions in this chapter is more modest: to find the referential range
of a category, the kinds of animals that speakers of a language include in it, where ‘kinds’
can be defined in biological terms (whether this be simply the species, genus, family, etc.
recognised by biologists, or features of morphology or behaviour that allow us to identify
biological categories, such as a folk taxon that consists of birds and bats).

    This objective might seem straightforward enough. But it is not, for reasons outlined in
the following section.


8.1.2.7 Shortcomings of dictionary definitions

For anyone wishing to compare taxonomies of flora and fauna in Oceanic languages a serious
problem is the poor quality of definitions provided in dictionaries and other sources. Ideally,
the taxonomies of a language should be inferable from information given in the dictionary.[4]

[4] Almost fifty years ago Conklin (1962:144) laid down a set of desiderata for dictionaries, especially for the
 provision of systematic information about folk taxonomies. (Conklin had bilingual dictionaries in mind but the
 same standards should apply to monolingual dictionaries.) Ideally, a dictionary should provide:
    1. consistent marking of each entry as to its status as a lexical unit and taxon, its immediately subordinate
       taxa and superordinate taxon, and all coordinate taxa included with it in this next higher taxon …;
    2. differential marking of translation labels and of definitions;
    3. concise indication of distinctive attributes which define categories belonging to analysed lexical sets:
    4. systematic cross-referencing to maximal taxa in all major subhierarchies, to referential synonyms, and
       to all units involved in categoric overlap; and
    5. frequent use of structural charts and diagrams.

428   Andrew Pawley


The definitions we find often betray the fact that the definer has not carefully investigated
the range of reference of a term or variations in the way different speakers use that term.

    For example, many Oceanic dictionaries give a bare gloss, ‘general term for fish’, or
simply ‘fish’, without mentioning which kinds of creatures are included. Such a simple gloss
is unhelpful for two reasons. First, the meaning of the English term ‘fish’ is itself imprecise:
as noted above, it does not have the same range for all native speakers of English. Second, if
a dictionary simply defines term X as ‘fish’ we have no assurance that the dictionary-maker
has systematically investigated the semantic range of X.

     A slightly different sort of gap is exemplified by an entry in Dixon’s (1970) dictionary of
Dobuan, a Papuan Tip language, which glosses _iyana_ as ‘fish, including alligators’. Leaving
aside the detail that alligators but not crocodiles are found in New Guinea waters, we are
left wondering what else besides fish and crocodiles counts as _iyana_. Lithgow’s dictionary
of Muyuw, another Papuan Tip language, is a bit more informative, offering _yin_ ‘fish, turtles, crocodiles, but not shellfish’. But again, we are not told whether, say, eels, cetaceans,
dugongs, and octopus count as fish.

     In the case of major generics, different sources for the same language often offer conflicting
definitions. The standard dictionary of Motu (Lister-Turner and Clark 1954a) glosses
_gwarume_ simply as ‘fish’. However, Nigel Oram, who looked into the matter in some detail,
obtained a different and narrower definition of this term from his informants, namely ‘fish,
excluding sharks, rays, eels, and also excluding cephalopods’ (Oram, field notes). Capell’s (1941)
dictionary of Standard Fijian (based on the Bauan dialect of Eastern Fijian) glosses
_ika_ as ‘fish’, overlooking the fact that the Fijian term has a broader sense that includes turtles,
dolphins and whales (P. Geraghty, pers. comm.).

     Fox’s (1955) dictionary of Gela (Gela) defines _iga_ as a class name for any kind of sea
creature: ‘sea creature: fish, mollusc, crayfish, whale, squid, sea anemone, etc.’. However,
in his study of Gela fishing the zoologist Simon Foale (1998) distinguishes two uses of _iga_:
‘bony and cartiligenousfish’ vs ‘all fish, whales, dolphins, dugongs, turtles, crocodiles’.
Neither definition exactly matches Fox’s. (Foale’s definition of the second, extended sense does
not include squid, (shelled) molluscs, crayfish or anemones.) Do such differences reflect variation
among informants or less than exhaustive enquiry on the part of the authors, or a bit of
both?

     A further problem is that dictionaries, quite understandably, seldom provide a corpus of
examples showing how a term is used in everyday discourse. Such a corpus would, among
other things, help us decide whether a particular term is a true taxonomic generic rather than
a collective.

     With all these sobering considerations in mind, let us turn to the several POc terms and
their reflexes.


8.2 POc _*ikan_

8.2.1 Introduction

POc _*ikan_, roughly glossable as ‘fish’, is an extremely well-supported reconstruction, which
continues PAn _*Sikan_ ‘fish’ and PMP _*ikan_ ‘fish’ (Blust 1995). What is less clear is what
kinds of creatures counted as _*ikan_ for POc speakers, and/or whether _*ikan_ had two distinct
senses, one with narrower and the other with broader ranges of reference.

                                                           Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic?       429

: __Table 8.1__         Implicational scale of types that may be included in reflexes of _*ikan_

__tablenh__
     (1)  |  typical fish
     (2)  |  1 + sharks and rays
     (3)  |  2 + cetaceans (whales, dolphins) and dugongs
     (4)  |  3 + eels
     (5)  |  4 + turtles
     (6)  |  5 + crocodiles
     (7)  |  6 + cephalopods (octopus, squid, etc.)
     (8)  |  7 + decapod crustaceans (crabs, crayfish, prawns and their relatives)
     (9)  |  8 + other aquatic invertebrates (molluscs with shells, sea hares, nudibranchs, echinoderms, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, jellyfish, etc.)


    All Oceanic languages have a generic term that can be translated roughly by English
‘fish’ and typically this term is a reflex of POc _*ikan_. However, the scope of this generic
varies considerably from language to language. A first comparison of definitions across the
group indicates that if ‘typical fish’ are taken as the core members of the class, extensions
to include other kinds of creatures can be ordered along an implicational scale roughly as in
Table 8.1, bearing in mind that while most creatures of types (1-9) occur throughout much of
the Pacific, certain animals, such as dugongs and crocodiles, have more restricted ranges.

    Thus, the hypothesis is that if a language includes only one other group of animals in the
generic for ‘fish’ it will generally be sharks and rays and the next group to be included will
usually be cetaceans together with dugongs (if present) and after that will come eels, then
turtles, and so on. Let us refer to those generics whose semantic scope is restricted to (1) as
‘grade 1’, those restricted to (2) as ‘grade 2’, and so on.

    If this hypothesis were correct it would mean that the definition of Dobuan _iyana_ as
‘fish, including alligators’ entails that sharks, rays, eels, cetaceans, turtles and cephalopods are
also subsumed under _iyana_. In the same vein, the definition of Muyuw _yin_ as ‘fish, turtles,
crocodiles, but not shellfish’ implies that eels, cetaceans, dugongs, and octopus count as _yin_.

     The following discussion compares dictionary definitions of reflexes of POc _*ikan_ for
various groups of Oceanic languages. These comparisons are generally followed by tables
that make the dictionary definitions directly comparable by reformulating them in terms of
the presence or absence of particular classes of referents.


8.2.2 Reflexes of _*ikan_

    The only Central Pacific dictionary that distinguishes between a narrow sense of the _*ikan_
reflex, including only ‘true fish’ and a broader sense, including other large marine creatures,
is Wayan Fijian. The Wayan dictionary contains these example sentences:
_Na siihiana ika ni qwara, ei tarn tia ika dū_. ‘The octopus is a fish living in holes; it is not a true fish.
_Na ika dū ei vakalaulau_. ‘True fish have tails.’

    The semantic range exhibited by these definitions is summarised in Table 8.2. Here and
in later tables the following conventions are used to indicate whether or not the class of
referents listed at the head of each column is included in the meaning: ‘+’ = included, ‘-’ =
excluded, ‘(+)’ = there is disagreement among speakers, and/or certain members of the class
are included, others excluded, and ‘?’ indicates that sources do not say whether or not the
referent is included.

    The Polynesian languages cited here agree fairly well in their range of referents. Leaving
aside cases where the definition is uninformative on this point, reflexes of _*ikan_ always
include not only typical fish but also sharks, rays and cetaceans. Most (six out of eight) also
include turtles. Most (all but one) exclude crusteaceans and molluscs with shells. The main
area of disagreement concerns eels (three languages include them, three exclude them) and
cephalopods (three include them, six exclude them). The most reasonable historical inference is
that Proto Polynesian (PPn) _*ika_ embraced sharks and rays, cetaceans and turtles.
The status of eels and cephalopods in the PPn taxonomy is less certain.

    Rotuman and the Fijian languages agree in including eels and cephalopods, as well as
sharks and rays, cetaceans and turtles, and in excluding crustaceans and molluscs with shells.
Table 8.3 proposes likely semantic profdes for PPn and Proto Central Pacific.


8.2.2.2 Micronesian

Details follow of reflexes of _*ikan_ in five Micronesian languages for which quite informative
definitions are available. The semantic range exhibited by these definitions is summarised in
Table 8.4.

 Kiribati    |   _ika_       | ‘fish: all swimming marine creatures including turtles, dugong, whales and porpoises, but not squid or octopus’
 Marshallese | _ek_          |  ‘fish’ (Abo et al. 1976) However, in the English-Marshallese finder list, under ‘fish’, the authors list terms for ‘dolphin’, ‘giant octopus’, and ‘jellyfish’ as well as ‘shark’, ‘eel’, but not ‘whale’ or ‘turtle’
 Carolinian |        _īx_    | ‘generic term for fish’ (Jackson and Marck 1991). However, in the English-Carolinian finder list, under ‘fish’, the authors list terms for ‘porpoise’, ‘whale’, ‘octopus’, ‘sea urchin’, ‘starfish’, ‘sea cucumber’, as well as ‘eel’, ‘shark’ and ‘ray’, though not ‘turtle’
 Woleaian    |   _ixar_      | ‘fish’ (Sohn and Tawerilmang 1976). However, in the English-Woleaian finder list, under ‘fish’, the authors list terms for ‘dolphin’, whale’ as well as ‘eel’, ‘shark’ and ‘ray’, though not ‘turtle’, ‘octopus’ or ‘squid’.

     All the languages sampled typically exclude turtles, molluscs and crustaceans. Some
definitions include eels and cetaceans but others are indeterminate.


8.2.2.3 Southeast Solomonic and Northwest Solomonic

Informative definitions are available for a few Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands.
Among the following, all belong to the SE Solomonic group except Marovo, which is NW
Solomonic. For each of Lau and Gela, two definitions are given, from different sources.

__tablenh__
 Arosi       |    _iʔa_    |     ‘fish, including sharks, rays; also porpoises, and possibly other marine animals’
 Lau         |    _iʔa_    |     ‘fish, any sea creature’ (Fox 1955)
 Lau         |    _iʔa_    |     (1) ‘typical fish, sharks and rays’; (2) ‘extended to include large marine animals such as porpoises, whales, dugongs’ (Akimichi)
 To’aba’ita  |    _iʔa_    |     ‘fish, sharks, rays, dolphins, whales, dugongs, turtles’ (F. Lichtenberk pers. comm.)
 Gela        |    _iɣa_    |     ‘sea creature: fish, mollusc, crayfish, whale, squid, sea anemone, etc.’ (Fox)
 Gela        |    _iɣa_    |     (1) ‘bony and cartiligenous fish’; (2) ‘all fish, whales, dolphins, dugongs, turtles, crocodiles’ (Foale)
 Marovo      |    _iɣana_  |     ‘generic for all free-swimming creatures, e.g. fish, eels, stingrays, dolphins, whales, squid, jellyfish’

    It can be seen that the witnesses largely agree in including sharks, rays, eels, turtles,
cephalopods and crocodiles, virtually all free swimming aquatic creatures. Fox’s definitions
for Lau and Gela are extreme in including all marine organisms.

8.2.2.5 The Admiralties

Definitions are given for _*ikan_ reflexes in four Admiralties languages. The initial _n-_ they
show is a reduced form of the POc article _*na_ which has fused with the following noun.

__tablenh__
 Titan     |  _nii_   |  (1) ‘fish’, (2) ‘fish, porpoise, dugong, turtle, crocodile’
 Lenkau    |  _nik_   |  ‘fish, excluding porpoise, whale, turtle, crocodile’
 Penchal   |  _nii_   |  (1) ‘fish’, (2) ‘fish, turtle, porpoise, whale, octopus’
 Loniu     |  _ni_    |  ‘general term for fish’


    Discarding the Loniu definition as under-informative, we get the comparative breakdown
in Table 8.7. It can be seen that the definitions for Titan and Penchal agree in including sharks,
rays, cetaceans and turtles, but disagree over cephalopods.

8.2.3 Proto Oceanic _*ikan_ 1 and _*ikan_ 2

There is reason to think that POc _*ikan_ was polysemous, having a narrower sense, roughly
‘typical fish’ and a broader sense, which included various other aquatic animals. Among our
sources, such a distinction is made in just a few contemporary languages (chiefly Wayan
Fijian, Gela and Lau of SE Solomonic, and Titan and Penchal of the Admiralties) but it is
also tacitly present in the descriptions of certain Micronesian languages.

      As to a broader sense, if only the more detailed dictionary definitions are considered,
we find that in a high proportion of languages across different major subgroups the reflex of
*ikan refers to sharks and rays, eels, cetaceans and turtles, and also to dugongs and crocodiles
in places where these animals are present. I conclude that this was also the case in POc; that
is, _*ikan_ had at least grade 5 scope. Turtles were ‘fish’ in POc. The status of octopus and
squid is less clear. Other kinds of water-dwelling invertebrates, such as molluscs in shells and
crustaceans, have much weaker claims for inclusion. The balance of the evidence suggests
that while free swimming creatures with bones were _*ikan_, invertebrates that crawl, burrow
or stick to rocks probably weren’t. However, in a few languages (Lau, Gela, Marovo) the
scope of _*ikan_ has been widened to include all free swimming sea creatures. In Lau and Gela
it may been extended to all marine (and presumably freshwater) creatures (grade 7), although
different sources are in conflict on this point. We must allow that in some Oceanic languages
the semantic range of *ikan has reduced to grade 4, 3 or 2.

      The data loosely support the implicational scale given in Table 1. Some simplifications
may be in order. For example, among languages spoken where both crocodiles and turtles
are common, no language is known to include turtles but to exclude crocodiles or vice versa.
Thus, categories 6 and 7 can perhaps be merged. Only one language in the sample, Anejom,
includes crustaceans but excludes shelled molluscs, so an argument can be made for merging
categories 8 and 9. However, we have little information about the status of other marine
invertebrates included in category 9, such as jellyfish and sea hares.

      Why do speakers of various Oceanic languages (like people in many other places) place
certain other kinds of animals in the same class as typical fish? Most likely the reasons were
diverse. Some non-fish creatures look and behave rather like fish, e.g. whales, dolphins and
dugongs to some extent resemble fish in the way they swim and in being completely aquatic.
But what about turtles? Apart from being free-swimming bony animals that spend a lot of
time at sea, turtles do not look or behave like fish. What they have in common with certain
fish, perhaps, is that everywhere in the Pacific turtles are prized game, caught at sea. That
leaves crocodiles, which resemble sharks in being fearsome creatures but otherwise share
little in common with fish or turtles other than being free-swimming bony creatures.

      At any rate, the two senses of _*ikan_ reflexes pose a problem for Berlin’s system of
taxonomic ranks. If the ‘typical fish’ category counts as a life form, what is the status of extended
categories such as ‘all water creatures’ or ‘all creatures that are free-swimming’ or ‘typical fish,
eels, cetaceans, turtles and crocodiles’? Clearly, categories that contain creatures of
such diverse appearance do not fit well with Berlin’s requirement (§1.2.3) that members of
the same life form taxon share a distinctive morphotype or with Wierzbicka’s analogous requirement
(§1.2.4) that one should be able to draw a generalized picture of the type. In order
to convince Wierzbicka that in a language L, the extended sense of _*ikan_ reflexes, encompassing
turtles, crocodiles, dolphins, etc., is a true major generic in the same way that the
narrower, sense applying to ‘typical fish’ is, we would have to show that speakers of L use
the extended generic not just as a collective but also to refer to individual turtles, crocodiles
and dolphins, e.g. ‘See that _ikan_ there. It’s a turtle.’ and ‘We caught ten _ikan_ and two of them
were turtles.’ Unfortunately, this kind of data is almost completely lacking for the languages
in our sample.

                                                         Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic?   437


8.3 POc _*pinaŋoda_

More light might be shed on the scope of POc _*ikan_ if it could be shown to contrast with another
generic having a complementary meaning. There is a candidate. Clark (1991) provides
an insightful reconstruction of the history of a POc term, _*pinaŋoda_, that referred to a class
of sea creatures that evidently stood in contrast to _*ikan_. The following discussion is based
largely on his account.

    Dictionaries of some Polynesian languages explicitly mention a two-way contrast between a
reflex of PPn _*ika_, denoting fish and other large aquatic vertebrates such as dolphins
and turtles and a term, reflecting PPn _*fiŋota_, that denotes forms of sea life other than *ika,
but especially molluscs and other invertebrates found on the reef. Compare, for example, the
Tongan and Samoan entries in the following comparison:

__table__
_Polynesian_ | |
    Tongan      |     _fiŋota_    |  ‘sea creature other than ika (fish, turtles, etc.) especially shellfish, but also crustaceans, cephalopods, jellyfish, eels, sea-snakes, sea cucumbers, starfish, seaweed’
     Samoan     |     _fiiŋota_   |  ‘general term for sea animals except fish, cetaceans and turtles, especially molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms and sea cucumbers’
    Niuatoputapu | _finjota_     |    ‘shelled marine animals that creep or crawl: Crustacea, molluscs and echinoderms’
    East Futuna   |   _finjota_  |   ‘coquillage’ [molluscs with external shells]
    Tokelauan     |   _fiiŋota_  |   ‘general term for shellfish’
    Ifira-Mele    |   _finjota_  |   ‘shellfish’ [molluscs with external shells]
    Takuu         |   _fiinota_  |   ‘various types of shellfish and seafoods gathered by women’


    Cognates outside Polynesian are scarce, except in Papuan Tip languages. In the following,
_g_ for POc _*ŋ_  in Dobuan and Molima is unexpected (but regular in Kilivila).

__table__
 _Papuan Tip_ | |
    Dobuan     | _igoda_       |   ‘shellfish’
               | _igo-igoda_   |   ‘any inedible shellfish’
               | _lo-igoda_    |   ‘to gather shellfish’
    Molima     | _igoda_       |   ‘to collect shellfish’
    Kilivila   | _vigoda_      |   ‘shellfish (live, or shell only)’

438    Andrew Paw ley


    A problem with many of these definitions is that for some English speakers the term
‘shellfish’ refers only to molluscs with shells while for others it also includes crustaceans.
There is reason to think that the authors of the dictionary definitions cited here generally had
in the mind the former, narrower definition.[5]

    Clark argues convincingly that PPn _*fiŋota_ and Papuan Tip _vigoda_, _igoda_ are reductions
of POc _*p-in-aŋoda_, the nominalization of a verb, _*paŋoda_, by means of a well-attested
nominalising infix _*-in-_[6] The primary sense of _*paŋoda_ was ‘to gather seafood (other than
fish) on the reef’ with the additional sense ‘to fish, catch fish’. This verb is widely attested
in Oceanic. Selected examples are given below. In some witnesses, especially in Western
Oceanic, POc _*ŋ_ is unexpectedly reflected as a stop, _g_.

    Niuean        | _faŋota_    | ‘gather shellfish on the reef’
    Samoan        | _faaŋota_   | ‘to fish; fishing’
    Rennellese    | _haŋota_    | ‘to fish or gather shells, especially by women on the reef’

[5] One reason is that the authors of the dictionaries concerned are from Australia and NZ, where most people
 understand shellfish to refer just to molluscs with shells (Pawley 2004).

[6] _*paŋoda_. in turn, was probably diachronically a morphologically complex verb, reflecting the PMP prefix
 _*paN-_ ‘actor focus verb derivative’ plus a root, where _*V_ represents a nasal consonant whose point of articulation was homorganic with and replaced the initial consonant of the root. Compare POc _*kan-i_ ‘to eat sth.’ and
 _*paŋ-an_ 'to eat (intr)’ and other examples in Ross (1998c: 29-30). This suggests that _*paŋoda_ was an
 intransitive verb, one that referred to the general act of gathering seafood on the reef but could not be used to single out
 particular things gathered. The root in this verb was most likely POc _*koda_ or _*qoda_ ‘(v) eat raw seafood (flesh
 of fish or molluscs)’, '(n) raw seafood’ (Geraghty 1983. Lichtenberk 1994). with PMP antecedent _*qe(n)taq_
 (Blust 1972).

                                                     Were turtles fish in Proto Oceanic?     439


    A few languages retain a reflex of _*pinaŋoda_ in which the infix is transparently preserved.

__tablenh__
_Meso-Melanesian_ | |
   Tolai |  _winagonoi_    |        ‘generic name for sea-shells’
_North and Central Vanuatu_ | |
   Nguna |  _vinagoda_     |          ‘shell, shellfish’

    Can we conclude that POc _*pinaŋoda_ was a major generic, a life-form of the same rank as _*ikan_?
Almost certainly not. Clark concludes that _*pinaŋoda_ was probably not a biological taxon in
the strict sense but a collective, a term for a diverse category of things, namely
‘seafood gathered on the reef’ in which shellfish, i.e. molluscs, were the focal members.
Unfortunately, sources for contemporary Oceanic languages seldom provide discourse examples
to show how speakers talk about reflexes of _*pinaŋoda_. Whenever examples are given they
show the noun being used to refer to a non-specific entity, an undifferentiated collectivity.
Given the heterogeneity of the types of edibles subsumed under this term it would be surprising
if it behaves, grammatically, as anything other than a collective.

    Clark remarks that in some contemporary Oceanic languages _*pinaŋoda_ reflexes appear
to have become a biotaxon, specifically a generic for shellfish. This has happened in at least
two Polynesian languages (East Futunan and Tokelauan), one Vanuatu language (Nguna), and
two Papuan Tip languages (Dobuan and Kilivila). However, as sources do not give examples
showing how speakers of these languages use the shellfish generic we cannot be sure whether
is a genuine life-form taxon or a collective.


8.4 POc _*sisiq_

Oceanic speech communities that have access to reefs and beaches typically distinguish many
kinds of molluscs. Speakers of Wayan Fijian, for example, have approximately 140 names
for kinds of bivalve and gastropod shellfish, of which about 100 are gastropods. This is a
domain, then, where one might expect to find one or more high-order taxonomic categories
in Oceanic languages, a point made by Clark (1981).

    We have already seen that a reflex of _*pinaŋoda_ ‘seafood gathered on the reef’ has developed
into a generic for shellfish in Dobuan, Kilivila, Tolai and Nguna, as well as in certain Polynesian
languages. Clark (1981:268, 1991:79) also cites, as Polynesian examples
of a generic that encompassed both bivalves and gastropods, Marquesan (Ua Pou dialect)
_puukava_, Tahitian _puu_ and _puupuu_, Rennellese _hatu ʔatua_, and East Futuna and Tokelauan
_figota_.

    However, no widespread cognate set has been found that consistently serves as a general
name for shellfish. In fact, most Oceanic languages do not have such a taxon. It is more
common to find a generic that refers to edible gastropods, or at least to a large class of edible
gastropods, and a generic that refers to a large class of bivalves. But, once again, hardly any
 such terms have widespread cognates.

440    Andrew Pawley


   Perhaps the strongest candidate for a POc generic in this domain is _*sisiq_, which may
have had variants _*siseq_ and/or _*sisuq_[7] Reflexes of _*sisiq_ vary greatly in range of reference
across Oceanic languages.

    The semantic range of these terms may be arranged in a scale as shown in Table 8.9. The
semantic ranges of reflexes of _*sisiq_ in better documented Oceanic languages are shown in
Table 8.10.

    Has _*sisiq_ expanded its range of reference from domains (1) or (2), or did it already have
wider scope in POc? Was it already polysemous in POc, with both a broad and a narrow
application?[9]

    About 50 families of gastropods or snail-like molluscs, comprising hundreds of genera,
are found in the Indo-Pacific region. In almost all languages where the dictionary definitions
specify particular families or genera, these refer to nerites (members of the family Neritidae)
and to other fairly similar groups of small edible marine gastropods (grade 3). In many
Oceanic-speaking communities such small shellfish are regularly collected in large quantities
and often they supply a more significant part of the protein consumption than any other
gastropods. This, then, may have been its primary sense in POc.

[8] Pratt lists several compounds that refer to subtaxa of _sisi_: _sisi-loaloa_, _sisi-mataivi_,
_sisi-tanoa_, _sisi-tui_.

[9] For Proto Malayo-Polynesian Blust (1995) has reconstructed the doublets _*sisi_ and _*sisiq_
‘edible snail’, citing reflexes in two Philippines languages (Bikol _sisi_ ‘barnacles’,
Cebuano _sisi_ ‘small oysters’), one Borneo language (Murik _isi_ ‘snail’) and five Oceanic
languages, all from Central Pacific. He reconstructs a further doublet _*sisuq_ ‘edible snail’,
citing reflexes in Sasak _siso_ ‘snail’ and Makassarese _siso_ ‘small mollusk found in fish ponds’.

    POc _*sisiq_ certainly referred to a class of snail-like (gastropod) molluscs but, given the
very spotty data, it is difficult to determine the range of reference of this term. However,
the fact that _*sisiq_ reflexes are widely preserved as the first element in binominals, even in
languages where a reflex of *sisiq no longer occurs by itself, indicates that it was a generic of
some sort in Oceanic, participating in a number of binomials.

    There is some evidence that _*sisiq_ also served as a high-order generic, perhaps denoting
all gastropods, or all edible gastropods. It was noted above that reflexes of _*sisiq_ denoting
edible marine gastropods in general occur in at least one language in each of the following
subgroups: North New Guinea, SE Solomonic, New Caledonian, Fijian and Polynesian. It is
likely that there are other cases - our sample is very limited. However, in only two languages
in the sample do _*sisiq_ reflexes also serve as a generic for shelled molluscs in general,
including bivalves. Thus, there is no good evidence at present for attributing this last, much
wider range of reference to POc _*sisiq_.


8.5 POc  _*manuk_

8.5.1 Introduction

POc _*manuk_ is a well attested form whose semantic range certainly included birds in general,
but whose reflexes often have a broader scope. The implicational scale in Table 8.11,
going from the most restricted domain to the most inclusive, predicts fairly well the kinds of
variations in range seen among _*manuk_ reflexes.

 Niuean          |  _manu_       | ‘any living creature except humans and fish’ (Also _manu-lele_ ‘bird and bat but not insects; lit. ‘flying _manu_’)
 Maori           |  _manu_       | ‘bird’
 Tahitian        |  _manu_       | (1) ‘bird + flying insects’ (2) ‘land animal as opposed to iʔa’
                 |  _manu-manu_  | ‘insects’ [probably in vernacular sense, including arthropods]
 Hawaiian        |  _manu_       | ‘bird, any winged creature’
 Rarotongan      |  _manu_       | ‘creature, living thing, usually but not always bird; often used figuratively for a human being’ (also _manu-rere_, _manu-reva_ ‘bird’, _manu vaevaeʔā_ lit. ‘four legged animal’) and _manumanu_ ‘insects, small flies’)
 Samoan          |  _manu_       | (1) ‘bird’ (also manu-lele ‘bird’) (Milner) (2) ‘animal, beast’ (Milner) (3) ‘any living thing’ (Utugagana)
 Tokelauan       |  _manu_       | (1) ‘animal, beast’ (2) ‘bird’
 Futunan         |  _manu_       | ‘animal in general’; _manu-lele_ ‘bird’ (lit. ‘flying animal’)
 Uvea            |  _manu_       | ‘animals in general’; _manu-lele_ ‘bird’
 Ifira-Mele      |  _manu_       | ‘bird, bat (and possibly butterflies)’
 Tikopia         |  _manu_       | ‘terrestrial creatures: mammals, birds, arthropods, but ex                               cluding marine creatures’
 Rennellese      |  _manu_       | ‘land fauna except human beings, turtles and fish (incl. birds and flying insects)’ (also manu-gege ‘birds and flying insects’)
 Nukuoro         |  _manu_       | ‘living things in general’


    The semantic range of these terms may be arranged in a scale as shown in Table 8.12.
    This distribution of meanings suggests that PPn _*manu_ had a narrow sense ‘birds and
bats’ (with synonym _*manu-lele_), and an extended sense, roughly ‘all land animals other than
humans’. Among the languages cited above, Niuean and Tongan (Tongic), Rarotongan and
Tahitian (Eastern Polynesian), Rennellese, Samoan, Tokelauan and Tikopian (non-Eastern
Nuclear Polynesian) have an extended sense.

    In Futunan, Uvean, (and occasionally) Rarotongan, _manu_ can be extended to all creatures
other than humans and in Nukuoro that seems to be the standard meaning. This more extended
use has a restricted distribution in contemporary Polynesian languages and was probably not
present, or was rare, in PPn.

    Cecil Brown, in a paper on the development of life form taxa in Polynesian languages,
expresses doubts about the two-sense reconstruction. He concludes (Brown 1981:94) that ‘bird’
probably ‘constituted the primary, if not the only zoological reference’ of PPn _*manu_. If I
understand him correctly, Brown prefers to interpret the fact that Tongan, Niuean, Samoan,
Tikopia, Rennellese, Rarotongan, etc. agree in having a second, wider sense of _*manu_, as the
result of semantic extensions made independently several times in the history of the Polynesian
languages. He points out the importance of ecological factors. While birds must have
been very prominent creatures in all the islands of the Pacific, most of the islands settled by
Polynesians would have had very few land animals other than birds and small invertebrates.
All had lizards, a very few had snakes, otherwise there were only those animals brought
by humans: rats, dogs and (sometimes) pigs. When, in the post-European contact era, new
quadrupeds (such as cattle, horses and goats) arrived it would have been natural to extend the
reflex of _*manu_ to these.

    However, it seems to me more likely that _*manu_ was already polysemous in PPn. The
evidence indicating that PPn had a synonym for _*manu_ in its narrower sense, namely the
compound _*manu-lele_ ‘birds, bats, flying insects’ (lit. ‘flying _manu_’) is consistent with the
view that _*manu_ had two senses in PPn. The evidence from Fijian and Rotuman (see below)
also supports a polysemous reconstruction. Be that as it may, there can be little doubt that in
the Polynesian languages ecological factors have motivated both extensions and contractions
in the semantic range of reflexes of POc _*manuk_.

8.5.2.2 Rotuman and Fijian

Rotuman and the Fijian languages reflect only a reduplicated form _*manu-manu_. In Rotuman this
term denotes land animals other than humans. In Wayan it denotes all creatures. In
Bauan its narrower sense refers to birds and its wider sense includes all creatures. In all three
languages a compound consisting of a reflex of _*manu-manu_ plus a verb/adjective meaning
‘to fly, flying’ is used to distinguish birds and other flying animals from terrestrial animals.

    It can be seen that in this sample of Nuclear Micronesian languages most reflect POc
_*manuk_ with range of reference much broader than ‘bird’. In Kiribati and Mokilese the meaning
is approximately ‘land animals other than humans’. In Carolinian and Woleaian the reflex
refers to all animals other than humans (domains 1-4 on the implicational scale) but in Woleaian
it can also denote any object (domains 1-6). In Puluwatese the nominal reflex of _*manuk_
refers to living things in general, as is also the case for the numeral classifier reflex in most
Nuclear Micronesian languages. In Marshallese and Woleaian the reflex of _*manuk_ has become the term for ‘thing’.

    It is likely that the primary sense of the PMic noun _*man_ was at least as broad as ‘land
creatures other than humans’ and that this form had already become a classifier for humans
and animals.


8.5.2.4 Other Oceanic groups

Outside of the Nuclear Micronesian and Central Pacific groups, reflexes of _*manuk_ generally
have the narrower meaning ‘creature with wings: bird, bat, flying insect’. However, the
paucity of good dictionaries for Oceanic languages in most regions of Melanesia limits our
confidence in some of the glosses. The semantic range of reflexes of POc _*manuk_ in some
Oceanic languages other than Nuclear Micronesian and Central Pacific is shown in Table 8.15.

8.5.3 Flying creatures only or land creatures in general?

What does the total range of comparisons tell us about the semantic range of POc _*manuk_?
The variation among reflexes is striking. _*manuk_ is most widely attested in the meaning
‘winged or flying creatures: birds, bats and flying insects’, i.e. grade 2 on the scale.
However, the grade 3 meaning, encompassing all land animals, is common in Central Pacific and
Nuclear Micronesian, and is attested in one Papuan Tip witness, Muyuw. Grade 4, 5 and 6
meanings occur but with more restricted distributions.

    In terms of accounting for the distribution of meanings across subgroups, the most
economical interpretation of the full range of comparative evidence in POc is to assume that
_*manuk_ referred only to winged or flying creatures: birds, bats and flying insects. This meaning
dominates in subgroups other than Micronesian and Central Pacific. The wider meanings
displayed by some daughter languages are best regarded as post-POc innovations.

    This conclusion is consistent with the fact that outside of Oceanic, cognates of _*manuk_
generally refer to chickens or to birds in general but not to quadrupeds or marine animals.
Blust (2002) attributes to PMP _*manuk_ the meaning ‘chicken (domestic fowl)’ on the basis
of widespread reflexes in Western and Central MP languages. He also reconstructs a reduplicated
form PMP _*manu-manuk_ meaning ‘bird’, widely reflected with this sense in WMP
languages. Blust argues that PAn had an unrelated term for ‘bird’ namely _*ayam_, which was
replaced in this function by _*manu-manuk_ in PMP. In PMP _*ayam_ came to mean ‘domestic
animal (of any sort)’.

450    Andrew Pawley

    Given that birds are the dominant indigenous land fauna in the island groups of Remote
Oceania, and that there were no mammals native to this region, other than bats, it is not
surprising that the generic term for birds and bats should be extended to other land animals
(see discussion in §5.2.1). Here it seems is a case where a change in the meaning of a POc
biotaxon can be attributed to changes in the range of animal life encountered by speakers of
Oceanic daughter languages as they moved into new environments.


8.6 POc _*manu-manuk_

8.6.1 Reflexes of POc _*manu-manuk_ in Papuan Tip, SE Solomonic and Polynesian

Osmond (this volume, ch.7) observes that reflexes of a form _*manu-manuk_, meaning approximately
‘insects and other small invertebrates’ (corresponding to the English vernacular
category ‘insects’)[10] are found in three widely separated subgroups of Oceanic: Papuan Tip,
Southeast Solomonic and Polynesian. In certain languages in each of these groups the reflex
of _*manu-manuk_ stands beside and contrasts with a reflex of _*manuk_, meaning approximately
‘birds and other flying creatures’. Reduplications of _*manuk_, but with rather different
meanings, are also found in Lou (Admiralties), Fijian and Rotuman (see §5.2).

    In the definitions cited below from dictionary sources it is likely that the English gloss
‘insect’ is generally used in its vernacular sense.[10]

    Marquesan      |     _manu-manu_          |       ‘an insect’(pollex)
    Mangarevan     |     _manu-manu_          |       ‘insect seen clinging to branches and fermentin: substances’ (pollex)

     Rennellese    |   _manu-manu hogau_      |    ‘dragonfly’

[10] The _Shorter Oxford English Dictionary_ gives the following definition of the popular use of
‘insect’: “… in pop. use comprising, besides the animals scientifically so called (… [animals of
class Insecta]), many other arthropods, as spiders, mites, centipedes, wood-lice, etc. and other
invertebrates, as the ’coral insect’; still applied by the uneducated to earth-worms, snails,
etc. and even some small invertebrates, as frogs and tortoises.” The authors of the SOED seem to
have forgotten that the folk taxonomies of the ‘uneducated’ are as worthy as those of the ‘educated’!

: __Table 8.16__  Implicational scale of types that may be included in reflexes of _*manu-manuk_

                                    (1)  | one or a few insect taxa
                                    (2)  | insects in general
                                    (3)  | all living creatures


    These data yield the rather simple implicational scale in Table 8.16. It can be seen that
definitions of type (2) dominate. Just one language in the sample (Gela) has a greatly extended
sense: ‘all living creatures’. Unfortunately, the sources give no evidence that would tell us
whether forms with meanings of types (2) and (3) behave like true taxonomic generics or
whether they are used only as collectives.


8.6.2 What did POc _*manu-manuk_ mean?

It might seem a straightforward matter to conclude that _*manu-manuk_ was a generic or collective
term for insects in general. However, two complicating factors must be addressed.

     In many Oceanic languages a semi-productive use of nominal reduplication is to name
a taxon which resembles that named by the simple form but is smaller or otherwise atypical — not
quite the real thing (for discussion of this function of reduplication in Oceanic see
Ross 2008a: 50-51). Given such a mechanism, we must consider the possibility that a reduplicated
form of _*manuk_ developed independently in Papuan Tip, Southeast Solomonic and
Polynesian. On the formal level, such parallel development would not be surprising. However,
it seems unlikely that the meaning of the reduplicated derivative would in both cases
have been ‘insects, creepy crawlies’.

     The other complicating factor is that a case can be made for attributing another sense to
POc _*manu-manuk_, roughly ‘all creatures’ or ‘all creatures other than those that live in water’.
It was noted above (§5.2.2) that reflexes of _*manu-manuk_ have this broader range of reference
in Lou, Rotuman and the Fijian languages. However, I prefer to regard the Lou, Rotuman
and Fijian uses as post-POc innovations, in which the reflex of _*manu-manuk_ replaced the
_*manuk_ reflex as the general term for creatures or land creatures. Thus the conclusion that
_*manu-manuk_ existed in POc as a general term for insects and other small land invertebrates
still stands.[11] Some languages, chiefly in Polynesia, have narrowed its application use to just
one or a few insects but in one language its scope has been extended to encompass all living
things.

[11] Blust (2002) reconstructs a reduplicated form PMP _*manu-manuk_ meaning ‘bird’, widely
reflected with this sense in WMP languages, alongside PMP _*manuk_ ‘chicken’.

8.7 Conclusions

We have looked into the semantic histories of five POc terms, _*ikan_, _*pinaŋoda_, _*sisiq_,
_*manuk_ and _*manu-manuk_, each a candidate for the status of a high-level generic or life
form in the POc taxonomy of animals but each having reflexes with highly variable meanings.
Approximate semantic reconstructions can be given for each POc term, as follows:

__tablenh__
 _*ikan_        |     ‘high-level generic (life form) with two senses: 1. typical fish’; (2) ‘typical fish, sharks, rays, eels, cetaceans and dugongs, turtles and crocodiles, and possibly octopus and squid’
 _*pinaŋoda_    |     ‘collective term (not a life-form): seafood (other than fish) gathered on the reef’
 _*sisiq_         |   ‘folk generic: small globular gastropods (nerites, moon shells, periwinkles, etc.) which are an important part of the diet. Possibly also used as a collective or high-level generic for edible gastropods in general’
  _*manuk_         |  ‘high-level generic (life form): birds, bats and flying insects’
  _*manu-manuk_     | ‘high-level collective or generic (life form): insects and other small land invertebrates’

    Let us now return briefly to two questions asked at the outset. First, are the variations
in the meanings of major generics across daughter languages random or do they follow an
implicational scale, a natural sequence of semantic extension or contraction?

    Variations in definitions given to reflexes of _*ikan_, _*sisiq_, _*manuk_ and _*manu-manuk_
do appear to conform to implication scales, roughly those sketched in Tables 8.1, 8.9, 8.11
and 8.16, respectively. (We leave aside _*pinaŋoda_, which was a collective rather than a true
generic.) However, the nature of the data are such that we can only give approximate analyses.
Undoubtedly, finer-grained data and analysis would show that this picture is too simple. While
my main focus has been on the meanings of these five etyma, the foregoing question might
also be asked of non-cognate terms that refer to ‘the same’ kinds of semantic categories. A
wider comparative study that included non-cognate generic terms for kinds of animals would
provide a broader base for testing hypotheses about implicational scales. However, such a
study must be left for another occasion.

    Finally, why have such marked differences arisen in the semantic scope of these five
POc terms? Can some of the changes be attributed to differences in the range of animal
life encountered by different communities? All I will say here is that Oceanic islands differ
considerably in the richness of their land fauna, with atolls, and small, geographically remote
high islands having extremely impoverished fauna and that this variation may have played a
part in the semantic histories of two of the five terms considered here, _*manuk_ and
_*manu-manuk_. Brown (1981) has already pointed to the dominance of birds over other large land
animals as a possible driver of semantic change in _*manuk_ reflexes (see §5.2.1). But the
other three terms all refer to aquatic (chiefly marine) animals and, leaving aside crocodiles
and dugongs, the main types of marine fauna are fairly well represented throughout tropical
Oceania. It follows that shifts in the referential range of reflexes of POc _*ikan_, _*pinaŋoda_
and _*sisiq_ must be explained in terms of other factors.

Appendix A: Data sources and collation



1 Datasources
The subject matter of this volume is quite narrowly constrained. As a result we collated data
not only from the sources used for the project generally but also from compilations of animal
names in a number of languages. Both general and animal name data sources are listed below.
The source of an item is generally listed against it in the text only where it is not one of those
listed below or where it is an exceptional source for that particular language.


1.1 General sources
Sources are conveniently divided into published and unpublished.

   2. Electronic fdes provided by a number of scholars, some of which are themselves based
      on a variety of primary sources. The files include:
         a) The electronic files of lexical data collated during the research leading to the
            publication of Ross (1988), whose sources are listed in Appendices A and B of
            that work.
         b) The electronic files from the Comparative Austronesian Dictionary proj ect which
            resulted in Tryon (1995), which lists its own sources.
         c) The electronic files of Robert RlwslA Austronesian Comparative Dictionary, stored
            at the University of Hawai’i. The version to which we refer dates from 1995, and
            is abbreviated in this volume as acd.
         d) The electronic files of Biggs and Clark’s POLLEX: Proto Polynesian lexicon on
            disk at the University of Auckland. We refer to a June 2006 version, abbreviated
            pollex, which became available in the later stages of this volume’s preparation.
            In October 2010, when this volume was nearing completion, pollex went on line
            at http://pollex.org.nz.

2 Collation
The collation stage of the project, which took place in the early and mid 1990s, entailed in
the first instance the creation a data base of vocabulary materials in a defined set of semantic
domains from Oceanic languages for which data were already available (see §1.1). This data
base was kept in text files . Files were organised in accordance with a modified version of
the Summer Institute of Linguistics’ ‘standard format’ in which fields within each record are
labelled with an initial backslash followed by a single letter. In our version of the format,
each record was terminated with a carriage return, i.e. each record occupied a single line.
Each record contained a single word in a single language with associated information (a code
relating to the language’s subgroup, a gloss and any other semantic information, the source,
and any other notes the researcher chose to add). Records were organised on screen into
putative cognate sets. The use of text files rather than files in a proprietary database format
meant (i) that it was easy to view them on screen; (ii) that it was easy to manipulate them
with a variety of text editors and word processors; (iii) that more complex repetitive processes
could be performed by writing small programs in Icon (Griswold & Griswold 1990) and more
recently in Python; and (iv) that it was relatively easy to import and reformat other people’s
data sets and to export collated material into publications in preparation.
    Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages
from which data are cited here, data were transcribed at the collation stage into a standard
orthography (this volume, ch.l, §4.2) to enable us to recognise cognates and to spot regular
changes more quickly. This orthography is retained in the citation of data in these volumes.

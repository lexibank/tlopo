             Preface



   This second edition of volume 2 of The lexicon of Proto Oceanic has been produced to
satisfy three needs which have arisen more or less simultaneously. Firstly, and to our
satisfaction, the original 2003 print run sold out more quickly than we expected. Secondly,
Pacific Linguistics is moving towards corroborative publishing with ANU ePress, the
electronic publishing arm of The Australian National University, and a second edition of a
previously published volume was the most straightforward way of troubleshooting this
organisational change. Lastly, but nonetheless significantly, the volume needed a number
of small revisions, and the E Press edition allows us to make these updates.

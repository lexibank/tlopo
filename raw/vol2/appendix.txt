             Data sources and collation



1 Introduction
   Data sources which were consulted in relation to a particular terminology are noted in
the chapter on that terminology. However, quite a wide range of sources was consulted in
the construction of the data base and we list these here, rather than repeating them in each
chapter. Sources are conveniently divided into published and unpublished. In alphabetical
sequence of language, published sources are:

Computer files were provided by a number of scholars, some of which are themselves
based on a variety of primary sources. These files include:

• The computer files of lexical data collated during the research leading to the
  publication of Ross (1988), whose sources are listed in Appendices A and B of that
  work.
• The computer files from the Comparative Austronesian Dictionary project which
  resulted in Tryon ed. (1995), which lists its own sources.
• The computer files of Robert Blust’s Austronesian Comparative Dictionary on disk
  at the University of Hawaii. The version to which we refer dates from 1998.
• The computer files of Biggs and Clark’s POLLEX: Proto Polynesian lexicon on disk
  at the University of Auckland. The version to which we refer dates from December
  1993.
• Computer files of reconstructions with supporting cognate sets for North/Central
  Vanuatu (Clark 1994), Southern Vanuatu (Lynch 1996), and Micronesian (Bender et
  al. 1983).

  Numbami), Deborah Hill (for Longgu) and Malcolm Ross (for Takia).

  Clark), Sissano [Arop] (Stephen Whitacre), Sudest (Mike Anderson), Sursurunga
  (Don Hutchisson), Takia (Salme Bugenhagen, Judy Rehberg, Curtis Thomas),
  Tawala (Bryan Ezard), Teop (David Snyder), Tinputz (Roman Hostetler), Titan
  (Keith Lusk).


2 Collation
   The collation stage of the project consisted in the first instance of creating a data base of
vocabulary materials in a defined set of semantic domains from Oceanic languages for
which data were already available (see §1). This data base was kept in text files on
Macintosh computers. Files were organised in accordance with a modified version of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics’ ‘standard format’ in which fields within each record are
labelled with an initial backslash followed by a single letter. In our version of the format,
each record was terminated with a carriage return, i.e. each record occupied a single line.
Each record contained a single word in a single language with associated information (a
342   Appendix I

code relating to the language’s subgroup, a gloss and any other semantic information, the
source, and any other notes the researcher chose to add). The Macintosh allowed non-
standard characters to be created and viewed on screen. Records were organised on screen
into putative cognate sets. The use of text files rather than files in a proprietary database
format meant (i) that it was easy to view them on screen; (ii) that it was easy to manipulate
them with a variety of text editors and word processors; (iii) that more complex repetitive
processes could be performed by writing small programs in the Icon programming
language (Griswold & Griswold 1990); and (iv) that it was relatively easy to import and
reformat other people’s data sets and to export collated material into publications in
preparation.
   Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages
from which data are cited here, data were transcribed at the collation stage into a standard
orthography (see Ross 1988:3–4) to enable us to recognise cognates and to spot regular
changes more quickly. This orthography is retained in the citation of data in these volumes.

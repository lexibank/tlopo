1.1 Aims

This is the fifth in a series of volumes on the lexicon of the Proto Oceanic (POc) language.[1]
POc was the immediate ancestor of the Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian language family.
This subgroup consists of all the Austronesian languages of Melanesia east of 136˚ E, together
with those of Polynesia and (with two exceptions) those of Micronesia — more than 450
languages in all (see Map 1).[2] Extensive arguments for the existence of Oceanic as a clearly
demarcated branch of Austronesian were first put forward by Otto Dempwolff in the 1920s,
and the validity of the subgroup is now recognised by virtually all scholars working in
Austronesian historical linguistics.

    The development and break-up of the POc language and speech community were stages in
a truly remarkable chapter in human prehistory—the colonisation by Austronesian speakers of
the Indo-Pacific region in the period after about 2000 BC. The outcome was the largest of the
world’s well-established language families and (until the expansion of Indo-European after
Columbus) the most widespread. The Austronesian family comprises more than 1,000 distinct
languages. Its eastern and western outliers, Madagascar and Easter Island, are two-thirds of a
world apart, and its northernmost extensions, Hawai’i and Taiwan, are separated by 70 degrees
of latitude from its southernmost outpost, Stewart Island in New Zealand.

    It is likely that the divergence of Oceanic from its nearest relatives, which are the
Austronesian languages spoken around Cenderawasih Bay and in South Halmahera (Blust 1978a),
began when Austronesian speakers from the Cenderawasih Bay area moved eastwards
along the north coast of New Guinea and into the Bismarck Archipelago. There is a strong
school of opinion that associates the subsequent break-up of POc with the rapid colonisation
of Island Melanesia and the central Pacific by bearers of the Lapita culture between about
1200 and 900 BC (see Map 2 and volume 2, chapter 2).

[1] The project has been jointly directed by Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross, with research assistance from
    Meredith Osmond, in the Department of Linguistics, formerly of the Research School of Pacific and Asian
    Studies, now of the College of Asia and the Pacific, at the Australian National University. Originally, five
    volumes were planned, but the large amount of material has required this to be increased to seven (see p3).

[2] The listing in Lewis, Simons & Fennig (2015) contains 513 Oceanic languages.

    The present project aims to bring together a large corpus of lexical reconstructions for POc,
with supporting cognate sets, organised according to semantic fields and using a standard
orthography for POc. We hope that it will be a useful resource for culture historians,
archaeologists and others interested in the prehistory of the Pacific region. The comparative
lexical material should also be a rich source of data for various kinds of purely linguistic
research, e.g. on semantic change and subgrouping in the more than 450 daughter languages.

    Volume 1 of The lexicon of Proto Oceanic deals with material culture. Volumes 2, 3 and 4
examine relevant sets of cognate terms in order to gain insights into how POc speakers viewed
their environment. Volume 2 deals with the geophysical or inanimate environment, volumes 3
and 4 treat plants and animals respectively. The present volume and volume 6 return to
terminologies centring on people. This volume is concerned with gender and age, the body,
and human conditions and physical and cognitive activities that arise from nature rather than
nurture. Volume 6 will concern culturally learned activities, social organisation, belief systems,
rituals, recreation and other elements of non-material culture. The seventh and final volume
will perform a number of functions. It will treat certain lexical categories, e.g. closed classes of
lexical roots, not dealt with in earlier volumes. It will review the main findings of the project
concerning the culture and environment of Proto Oceanic speakers and will compare these
findings with what archaeology tells us about the way of life and environment of the bearers of
the Lapita culture. Volume 7 will also provide an index to the POc and other reconstructions
presented in the whole work, as well as an English-to-POc finderlist and a list of all languages
cited, together with their subgroups.[3]

    Chapter 2 of the present volume presents reconstructions and supporting cognate sets for
terms for people: ‘person’, ‘woman’, ‘man’, age cohort terms from early childhood to old age,
terms for people by absence or deprivation of relationship (‘orphan’, ‘unmarried adult’,
‘widow(er)’) and for twins. Kin relationship terms are handled in volume 6 rather than here, as
they are a dimension of social organisation.

    Chapters 3 to 7 concern terms that have to do with the human body. Chapter 3 presents
terms for the parts of the body and bodily substances, both substances of which the body is
made up and which it emits. Chapter 4 is dedicated to conditions and activities of the human
body, ranging from processes that occur spontaneously (sweating, breathing, snoring) to
deliberate activities like eating, drinking and copulating. In between these extremes are
numerous events with lesser degrees of agentivity, like sleeping, belching, yawning,
defecating, laughing and crying. Chapter 5 is entitled ‘Health and disease’ and gives some
insight into the diseases recognised and labelled by POc speakers. Chapter 6 investigates how
Oceanic languages talk about posture and movement, the latter including not only human
locomotion but also how people cause other people and things to move: raising and lowering,
pulling, pushing and putting, various modes of carrying, and so on. Chapter 7 gives terms for a
miscellany of activities performed with the body and its parts: working, gesturing, seizing and
holding, treading, bathing and washing, waiting and hiding.

    Chapters 8 to 11 deal with various aspects of the human mind. Chapter 8 presents terms for
the five senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and perceiving by touch. Chapter 9
investigates the structure and semantics of body-part metaphors in Oceanic languages, as these
evidently formed an integral part of the POc terminologies handled in Chapters 10 and 11.
Chapter 10 examines terms for various aspects of cognition (knowing and thinking, truth,
memory, deciding, agreeing, choosing and learning) and their organisation in POc. The final
chapter, Chapter 11, presents terms that human beings use to describe one another with respect
to their physical qualities, temperaments, emotions, desires and evaluations.

[3] This Introduction incorporates much of the material in the Introductions to Volumes 1–4. We replicate
    this material here in order that each volume can be used independently. The introduction to volume 3,
    however, introduced a fresh presentation of the subgrouping of Oceanic languages, and this is retained
    here.

1.2    The relation of the current project to previous work

Reconstructions of POc phonology and lexicon began with Dempwolff’s pioneering work in
the 1920s and 1930s. Dempwolff’s dictionary of reconstructions attributed to Proto
Austronesian (PAn) (Dempwolff 1938)—but equivalent in modern terms to Proto Malayo-Polynesian
(PMP)—contains some 600 reconstructions with reflexes in Oceanic languages.

    Since the 1950s, POc and other early Oceanic interstage languages have been the subject of
a considerable body of research. However, relatively few new reconstructions safely
attributable to POc were added to Dempwolff’s material until the 1970s. In 1969 George
Grace made available as a working paper a compilation of reconstructions from various
sources amounting to some 700 distinct items, attributed either to POc or to early Oceanic
interstages. These materials were presented in a new orthography for POc, based largely on
Biggs’ (1965) orthography for an interstage he called Proto Eastern Oceanic. Updated
compilations of Oceanic cognate sets were produced at the University of Hawai’i in the period
1977–1983 as part of a project directed by Grace and Pawley. These compilations and the
supporting data are problematic in various respects and we have made only limited use of
them.

    Comparative lexical studies have been carried out for several lower-order subgroups of
Oceanic: for Proto Polynesian by Biggs (resulting in Walsh & Biggs 1966, Biggs, Walsh & Waqa 1970
and subsequent versions of the POLLEX file, including Biggs & Clark 1993, Clark & Biggs 2006
and Greenhill & Clark 2011); for Proto Micronesian by scholars associated with
the University of Hawai’i (Bender et al. 1983, 2003); for the ancestor of the Banks and Torres
languages by Alexandre François (several unpublished manuscripts); for Proto North and
Central Vanuatu by Clark (Clark 1996, 2009); for Proto Southern Vanuatu by Lynch (1978b, 1996b, 2001c);
for New Caledonia by Ozanne-Rivierre (1992), Haudricourt & Ozanne-Rivierre (1982) and
Geraghty (1989); for Proto SE Solomonic by Levy (1980) and Lichtenberk (1988);
for Proto Central Pacific by Hockett (1976), Geraghty (1983, 1986, 1996, together with a
number of unpublished papers); for Proto Eastern Oceanic by Biggs (1965), Cashmore (1969),
Levy (1970), and Geraghty (1990); and for Proto Central Papuan by Pawley (1975),
Lynch (1978a, 1980), and Ross (1994a).

    Robert Blust (1970, 1980b, 1983-84a, 1986, 1989) of the University of Hawai’i has, in a
series of papers published extensive, alphabetically ordered, lexical reconstructions (with
supporting cognate sets) for interstages earlier than POc, especially for Proto Austronesian,
Proto Malayo-Polynesian and Proto Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. He has also written several
papers investigating specific semantic fields (Blust 1980a, 1982b, 1987, 1994). Blust & Trussel
have a major work in progress, the Austronesian Comparative Dictionary (ACD), which
will bring together all Blust’s reconstructions for Proto Austronesian and lower-order stages.
This is stored in electronic form at the University of Hawai’i.[4] The version to which we refer
dates from 2012.

6 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


   Several papers predating our project systematically investigated particular semantic
domains in the lexicon of POc, e.g. Milke (1958), French-Wright (1983), Pawley (1982, 1985),
Pawley & Green (1984), Lichtenberk (1986), Walter (1989), and the various papers in
Pawley & Ross (1994). Ross (1988) contains a substantial number of new POc lexical
reconstructions, as well as proposed modifications to the reconstructed POc sound system and
the orthography. However, previous Oceanic lexical studies were limited both by large gaps in
the data, with a distinct bias in favour of ‘Eastern Oceanic’ languages, and by the technical
problems of collating large quantities of data. Although most languages in Melanesia remain
poorly described, there are now many more dictionaries and extended word lists, particularly
for Papua New Guinea, than there were in the 1980s. And developments in computing
hardware and software now permit much faster and more precise handling of data than was
possible then. A list of sources and a summary of the Project’s collation procedures is found in
Appendix 1.

   Several compilations of reconstructions have provided valuable points of reference, both
inside and outside the Oceanic group. We are indebted particularly to Bender et al. (2003), two
editions of POLLEX (Biggs & Clark 1993 and Clark & Biggs 2006), Blust & Trussel (ACD),
Clark (2009) and Lynch (2001c).

   In the course of planning the several volumes of the present project, we came to realise that
the form in which preliminary publications were presented—namely as essays, each
discussing cognate sets for a particular semantic field at some length—would also be the best
form for the presentation of this set of volumes. A discursive treatment of individual
terminologies, as opposed, say, to a dictionary-type listing of reconstructions with supporting
cognate sets, makes it easier to relate the linguistic comparisons to relevant issues of culture
history, language change, and methodology. Hence each of the present volumes has as its core
a collection of analytic essays. Some of these have been published or presented elsewhere, but
are included here in revised form. In some cases we have updated the earlier versions in the
light of subsequent research, and, where appropriate, have inserted cross-references between
contributions. Authorship is in some cases something of a problem, as a number of people
have had a hand in collating the data, doing the reconstructions, and (re)writing for publication
here. In most chapters, however, one person did the research which determined the structure of
the terminology, and that person appears as the first or only author, and where another or
others had a substantial part in putting together the chapter they appear as the second and
further authors.


1.3        Reconstructing the lexicon

The lexical reconstructions presented in these volumes are arrived at using the standard
methods of comparative linguistics, which require as preliminaries a subgrouping or internal
classification of the languages in question (§1.3.2) and the working out of systematic sound
correspondences among cognate vocabulary in contemporary languages (§1.3.3). As well as
cognate sets clearly attributable to POc, we have included some cognate sets which at this stage
are attributable to various interstage languages, particularly Proto Western and Proto Eastern

[4] http://www.trussel2.com/ACD/.

Oceanic (but see §1.3.2.4 for definitions). We have set out to pay more careful attention to
reconstructing the semantics of POc forms than has generally been done in earlier work,
treating words not as isolates but as parts of terminologies.

1.3.1 Terminological reconstruction

Our method of doing ‘terminological reconstruction’ is as follows. First, the terminologies of
present-day speakers of Oceanic languages are used as the basis for constructing a hypothesis
about the semantic structure of a corresponding POc terminology, taking account of (i)
ethnographic evidence, i.e. descriptions of the lifestyles of Oceanic communities and (ii) the
geographical and physical resources of particular regions of Oceania. For example, by
comparing terms in several languages for parts of an outrigger canoe, or for growth stages of a
coconut, one can see which concepts recur and so are likely to have been present in POc.
Secondly, a search is made for cognate sets from which forms can be reconstructed to match
each meaning in this hypothesised terminology. The search is not restricted to members of the
Oceanic subgroup; if a term found in an Oceanic language proves to have external (non-Oceanic)
cognates, the POc antiquity of that term will be confirmed and additional evidence
concerning its meaning will be provided. Thirdly, the hypothesised terminology is re-examined
to see if it needs modification in the light of the reconstructions. There are cases,
highlighted in the various contributions to these volumes, where we were able to reconstruct a
term where we did not expect to do so and conversely, often more significantly, where we
were unable to reconstruct a term where we had believed we should be able to. In each case,
we have discussed the reasons why our expectations were not met and what this may mean for
Oceanic culture history.

    Blust (1987:81) distinguishes between conventional ‘semantic reconstruction’, which asks,
“What was the probable meaning of protomorpheme X?”, and Dyen and Aberle’s (1974)
‘lexical reconstruction’, where one asks, “What was the protomorpheme which probably
meant ‘X’?” At first sight, it might appear that terminological reconstruction is a version of
lexical reconstruction. However, there are sharp differences. Lexical reconstruction applies a
formal procedure: likely protomeanings are selected from among the glosses of words in
available cognate sets, then an algorithm is applied to determine which meaning should be
attributed to each set. This procedure may have unsatisfactory results, as Blust points out.
Reconstructions may end up with crude and overly simple glosses; or no meaning may be
reconstructed for a form because none of the glosses of its reflexes is its protomeaning.

    Terminological reconstruction is instead similar to the semantic reconstruction approach. In
terminological reconstruction the meanings of protomorphemes are not determined in
advance. Instead, cognate sets are collected and their meanings are compared with regard to:

__block__
- their specific denotations, where these are known;
- the geographic and genetic distribution of these denotations (i.e. are the glosses from
  which the protogloss is reconstructed well distributed? );
- any derivational relationships to other reconstructions;
- their place within a working hypothesis of the relevant POc terminology (e.g., are terms
  complementary —‘bow’ implies ‘arrow’; ‘seine net’ implies ‘floats’ and ‘weights’? Are
  there different levels of classification—generic, specific, and so on?).

8 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


For example, it proved possible to reconstruct the following POc terms for tying with cords
(vol.1:290–293):

__block__
- POc _*buku_ ‘tie (a knot); fasten’
- POc _*pʷita_ ‘tie by encircling’
- POc _*paqu(s)_, _*paqus-i-_ ‘bind, lash; construct (canoe +) by lashing together’
- POc _*pisi_ ‘bind up, tie up, wind round, wrap’
- POc _*kiti_ ‘tie, bind’

In each of the supporting cognate sets from contemporary languages there are a number of
items whose glosses in the dictionaries or word lists are too vague to tell the analyst anything
about the specific denotation of the item, and in the case of _*kiti_ this prevents the assignment
of a more specific meaning. The verb _*buku_ can be identified as the generic term for tying a
knot because of its derivational relationship (by zero derivation) with a noun whose denotation
is clearly generic, *buku ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood,
string or rope’ (vol.1:85–86; this volume, §3.6.8.1.2). Reconstruction of the meaning of _*pʷita_
as ‘tie by encircling’ is supported by the meanings of the Lukep, Takia and Longgu reflexes,
respectively ‘tie by encircling’, ‘tie on (as grass-skirt)’, and ‘trap an animal’s leg; tie s.t. around
ankle or wrist’: Lukep and Takia are North New Guinea languages, whilst Longgu is SE
Solomonic. Reconstruction of the meaning of _*paqu(s)_, _*paqus-i-_ as ‘bind, lash; construct
(canoe +) by tying together’ is supported by the meanings of the Takia, Kiribati and Samoan
reflexes, respectively ‘tie, bind; construct (a canoe)’, ‘construct (canoe, house)’, and ‘make,
construct (wooden objects, canoes +)’: Takia is a North New Guinea language, Kiribati is
Micronesian, and Samoan is Polynesian. The meaning of _*pisi_ is similarly reconstructed by
reference to the meanings of its Mono-Alu, Mota, Port Sandwich, Nguna and Fijian reflexes.

    Often, however, the authors have been less fortunate in the information available to them.
For example, Osmond (vol.1:222–225) reconstructs six POc terms broadly glossed as ‘spear’.
Multiple terms for implements within one language imply that these items were used
extensively and possibly in specialised ways. Can we throw light on these specialised ways?
Unfortunately, some of the word lists and dictionaries available give minimal glosses, e.g.
‘spear’, for reflexes of the six reconstructions. What we need to know for each reflex is: what
is the level of reference? Is it a term for all spears, or perhaps all pointed projectiles including
arrows and darts? Or does it refer to a particular kind of spear? Is it noun or verb or both? If a
noun, does it refer to both the instrument and the activity? Most word lists are frustratingly
short on detail. For this kind of detail, ethnographies have proved a more fruitful source of
information than many word lists.

    Another problem is inherent in the dangers of sampling from over 450 languages. The
greater the number of languages, the greater are the possible variations in meaning of any
given term, and the greater the chances of two languages making the same semantic leaps
quite independently. Does our (sometimes quite limited) cognate set provide us with a clear
unambiguous gloss, or have we picked up an accidental bias, a secondary or distantly related
meaning? Did etymon x refer to fishhook or the material from which the fishhook was made?
Did etymon y refer to the slingshot or to the action of turning round and round?

1.3.2 Subgrouping and reconstruction

1.3.2.1 Subgrouping

Although the subgrouping of Austronesian languages, and hypotheses about which
protolanguage was spoken where, remain in certain cases somewhat controversial, it is
impossible to proceed without making some assumptions about these matters. Figures 1 and 2
are approximate renderings of our subgrouping assumptions. The upper part of the tree, shown
in Figure 1, is due to Blust, originally presented in Blust (1977) and repeated with additional
supporting evidence in subsequent publications (Blust 1978a, 1982, 1983-84b, 1993, 2009a).[5]
The diagram of the lower (Oceanic) part of the tree in Figure 2 shows nine primary subgroups
of Oceanic. Its rake-like structure indicates that no convincing body of shared innovations has
been found to allow any of the nine subgroups to be combined into higher-order groupings.
Sections 1.3.2.2, 1.3.2.3 and 1.3.2.4 offer some commentary on our subgrouping, and in
§1.3.2.4 we explain how we handle the rake-like structure in making reconstructions.

[5] For critical overviews of the literature on Austronesian subgrouping, see Ross (1995b), Pawley (1999),
    Adelaar (2005) and Blust (2009a). The CEMP and Central Malayo-Polynesian linkages, and also
    PEMP, have been called into question, but these issues lie beyond our present scope
    (Donohue & Grimes 2008, Blust 2009b).

1.3.2.2 Kinds of subgroup

In Figures 1 and 2 each node is either a single language,[6] usually a reconstructed protolanguage,
or, in italics, a group of languages.

    Where a node is a protolanguage, its descendants form a proper subgroup (in the technical
sense in which historical linguists use the term ‘subgroup’). A proper subgroup is identified by
innovations shared by its member languages, i.e. it is ‘innovation-defined’ in the terminology
of Pawley & Ross (1995). These innovations are assumed to have occurred just once in the
subgroup’s protolanguage, i.e. the exclusively shared ancestor of its members. Thus languages
of the large Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian share a set of innovations relative to the earlier
Austronesian stages shown in Figure 1 (Dempwolff 1934).[7] By inference these innovations
occurred in their common ancestor, POc, and the claim that they are innovations is based on a
comparison of reconstructed POc with reconstructed PMP. The innovations may be phonological
(e.g. PMP _*e_, pronounced [ə], and PMP _*aw_ both became POc _*o_), morphological (e.g. POc
acquired a morphological distinction between three kinds of possessive relationship: food, drink
and default), or lexical (e.g. PMP _*limaw_ ‘citrus fruit’ was replaced by POc _*molis_).

    Italics are used in Figures 1 and 2 to indicate a group of languages which is not a proper
subgroup, i.e. has no identifiable exclusively shared parent. Thus Formosan languages in
Figure 1 indicates a collection of languages descended (along with PMP) from PAn. They are
spoken in Taiwan, but do not form a subgroup. There was no ‘Proto Formosan’, as Formosan
languages and language groups are all descended directly from PAn.

    Some of the italicised labels in Figures 1 and 2 include the term linkage. A linkage (an
‘innovation-linked group’ in the terminology of Pawley & Ross 1995) is a collection of
usually quite closely related languages or dialects,[8] speakers of which were in sufficient
contact at one time or another during their history for innovations to pass from one language
to the next, often resulting in a pattern such that the domains of various innovations overlap
but are not coterminous.[9] A number of Oceanic linkages have been recognised by scholars
researching the history of the languages of Fiji (Geraghty 1983), of the Caroline Islands
(Jackson 1983), of NW Melanesia (Ross 1988), of the SE Solomons (Lichtenberk 1988, 1994a;
Pawley 2011) and of Vanuatu (Tryon 1976, Clark 1985, Lynch 2000c, 2004b, François 2011a, 2014).[10]
A linkage may arise in at least three ways, but distinguishing between them is
often impossible.


[6] The two very closely related languages Mussau and Tench form a minor exception.

[7] Chapter 4 of Lynch (2002e) gives a recent account of these innovations.

[8] In what follows, ‘language’ is used to mean ‘language or dialect’.

[9] One or more innovations may spread right across the languages of the linkage. In this case it becomes
   virtually impossible to distinguish it from a proper subgroup.

[10] Recent work in Indo-European appeals to the concept of linkage: Garrett (2006) suggests that the
   dialects ancestral to Greek were not dialects of ‘Proto Greek’ but a collection of Nuclear Indo-European
   dialects drawn together by relations between the communities ancestral to the Greek city states, across
   which spread the innovations which characterise Ancient Greek.

12 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond

    First, what would otherwise be a proper subgroup may happen to lack exclusively shared
innovations, perhaps because the parent did not exist as a unit for long enough to undergo any
innovations of its own.[11]

    Second, a linkage may consist of some but not all of the languages descended from a single
parent. The Western Oceanic linkage reflects the innovations of POc, but no innovation is
common to the whole of Western Oceanic (although the merger of POc _*r_ and _*R_ comes
close). However, the languages of its three component linkages—North New Guinea, Papuan
Tip and Meso-Melanesian—display complex patterns of overlapping innovations. The
Western Oceanic linkage appears to be descended from the dialects of POc that were left
behind in the Bismarck Archipelago after speakers of the languages ancestral to the other eight
primary subgroups in Figure 2 had moved away to the north or east (Ross 2014, In press).
After these departures various innovations occurred. Each arose somewhere in the Western
Oceanic dialect network and spread to neighbouring dialects without reaching every dialect in
the network.

    The third type of linkage is the result of contact among languages descended from more
than one immediate parent, indicated in Figure 2 by a dashed line around the relevant groups
of languages. An example is the Fijian linkage, which represents the partial resynthesis of the
Fiji-based descendants of earlier Western Central Pacific and Eastern Central Pacific linkages
after Rotuman and Polynesian had split off from them (Geraghty & Pawley 1981, Geraghty 1983,
Pawley 1996c).[12] Geraghty reconstructed the history of the Fijian linkage by painstaking
analysis of innovations from at least two stages in its history. From the earlier period Western
Fijian languages share innovations with Rotuman and Eastern Fijian with Polynesian. From a
more recent period Western Fijian and Eastern Fijian languages share innovations with each
other, reflecting their reintegration into a single linkage, within which the present
Western/Eastern boundary has shifted relative to the (fuzzy) boundary of the earlier period.

    For most of the linkages noted in Figures 1 and 2 this kind of analysis is not available. For
example, Blust (1993) argues that CEMP was a linkage. But its history is far from clear. Does
CEMP perhaps include some languages that share history with languages to their west and
others that share history with those to their north? The North/Central Vanuatu linkage, long
assumed to be some sort of genealogical unit, appears to reflect the partial reintegration of at
east two dialect networks, North Vanuatu and Central Vanuatu, that probably had not diverged
greatly from each other, but the details of this history are difficult to elucidate (Lynch 2000c).[13]

    The languages of a linkage have no identifiable exclusively shared parent.Yet we have
found many instances in which a cognate set is limited to one of the linkages in Figures 1
and 2: CEMP, Western Oceanic, New Guinea Oceanic, Southern Oceanic or the reintegrated
North and Central Vanuatu linkage. As with PEOc and Proto Remote Oceanic (§1.3.2.4), we think it is
preferable to attribute these reconstructions to a hypothetical protolanguage rather than to a
higher node in the tree. Hence there are reconstructions labelled PCEMP, PWOc and so on.

[11] A situation in which a subgroup is both proper (i.e. defined by exclusive innovations) and a linkage
     (displaying overlapping patterns of innovations) is of course possible, the exclusively shared
     innovations having occurred in the parent, the others after the break-up of the parent. It so happens that
     we have no need of this construct here.

[12] ‘Eastern Fijian languages’ in Figure 2 is our label for Geraghty’s (1983) ‘Tokalau Fijian’.

Again these apparent lexical innovations offer only the weakest evidence for the protolanguage to
which they are attributed. In addition to the explanations of the kinds offered for PEOc and PROc
etyma in §1.3.2.4 it is possible, for example, that an innovatory ‘PWOc’ etymon arose when the
Western Oceanic dialect network was still close-knit, and spread from dialect to dialect before the
network broke into the two networks ancestral to its present-day first-order subgroups.

1.3.2.3 Further notes on subgroups

This section brings together brief notes on the subgroups in Figure 2 beyond those mentioned
in the discussion in §1.3.2.2.

    Admiralty is a proper subgroup Ross (1988: ch.9).

    Western Oceanic consists of the North New Guinea linkage (NNG), Papuan Tip family
(PT), Meso-Melanesian linkage (MM) and the Sarmi/Jayapura (SJ) group (see Map 4). The
last-named may belong to the NNG linkage, but this is uncertain Ross (1996b). It is not shown
in Figure 2 and its languages do not play a crucial role in reconstruction. It is possible that the
NNG and PT groups form a super-group, the New Guinea Oceanic linkage, and so etyma
reflected only in NNG and PT languages are attributed to a putative Proto New Guinea
Oceanic (Milke 1958, Pawley 1978), and etyma reflected in either NNG or PT (or both) and in
MM are labelled PWOc.

    SE Solomonic was established as a proper subgroup by Pawley (1972:98–110). Further
support was provided by Levy (1979, 1980, n.d.), Tryon & Hackman (1983) and Lichtenberk
(1988). Lichtenberk (1994b) and Pawley (2011) look at the internal structure of SE Solomonic.
    Temotu comprises the languages of the Reef Islands, Santa Cruz, Utupua and Vanikoro,
located 400 km east of the main Solomons archipelago and to the north of Vanuatu (Map 3).
Its identity as a proper subgroup of Oceanic was established by Ross & Næss (2007) and
further supported by Næss & Boerger (2008).

    The Southern Oceanic linkage as proposed by Lynch (1999, 2000c, 2001d, 2004b) is
characterised by complex overlapping innovations, but by none that are reflected in all its
member languages and would qualify it as a proper subgroup (see discussion in Lynch, Ross
& Crowley 2002:112–114).[14]

    Micronesian is a proper subgroup (Jackson 1983, 1986, Bender et al. 2003).

    Central Pacific is a proper subgroup, but one defined by only a handful of shared innovations,
indicating that the period of unity was short (Geraghty 1996). The high-order subgrouping of
Central Pacific is due to Geraghty (1983), except for the position of Rotuman, due to Pawley
(1996b). Within Central Pacific is another long recognised proper subgroup, Polynesian, for
which Pawley (1996a) lists diagnostic innovations.

1.3.2.4 Criteria for reconstruction


[14] Because they have only been recently proposed, Temotu and Southern Oceanic do not appear in Figure 1 of
     volumes 1 and 2.

Introduction   15
16 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond

The strength of a lexical reconstruction rests crucially on the distribution of the supporting
cognate set across subgroups. The distribution of cognate forms and agreements in their
meanings is much more important than the number of cognates. It is enough to make a secure
reconstruction if a cognate set occurs in just two languages in a family, with agreement in
meaning, provided that the two languages belong to different primary subgroups and provided
that there is no reason to suspect that the resemblances are due to borrowing or chance. The
PMP term _*apij_ ‘twins’ is reflected in several western Malayo-Polynesian languages (e.g.
Batak _apid_ ‘twins, double (fused) banana’) but only a single Oceanic reflex is known, namely
Roviana _avisi_ ‘twins of the same sex’. Because Roviana belongs to a different first-order
branch of Malayo-Polynesian from the western Malayo-Polynesian witnesses and because
there is virtually no chance that the agreement is due to borrowing or chance similarity, this
distribution is enough to justify the reconstruction of PMP _*apij_, POc _*apic_ ‘twins’.

    The rake-like form of Figure 2 almost certainly reflects the very rapid settlement of
Oceania out of the Bismarcks,[15] but it confronts us with a methodological question. If we
follow the rubric that we make a reconstruction if a cognate set occurs in languages of just two
primary subgroups, then reflexes of an etymon in, say, a SE Solomonic language and a
Micronesian language would be sufficient evidence for a POc reconstruction and the absence
of reflexes in Admiralty and Western Oceanic would be irrelevant. Given what we know about
the location of the POc homeland (in the Bismarcks; vol.2, ch.2) and the early eastward spread
of Oceanic speakers, this is too loose a criterion. Instead, we assume two hypothetical nodes
not shown in the tree in Figure 2.16 These are

__block__
- Remote Oceanic, comprising Southern Oceanic, Micronesian and Central Pacific;
- Eastern Oceanic, comprising SE Solomonic and Remote Oceanic.[17]

    If a cognate set occurs in two or all three of the groups in Remote Oceanic, the
reconstruction is attributed to Proto Remote Oceanic (PROc). If a cognate set occurs in one or
more of the groups in Remote Oceanic and in SE Solomonic, it is attributed to Proto Eastern
Oceanic (PEOc). In this way we acknowledge that such reconstructions may represent an
innovation that postdates the spread of the early Oceanic speech community. There are enough
Proto Remote Oceanic and PEOc reconstructions to suggest that such lexical innovations indeed occurred. This
in turn provides evidence for Remote Oceanic and Eastern Oceanic subgroups, but evidence
that is too weak to be relied on, for at least two reasons. First, it is quite possible that some of
our Proto Remote Oceanic and PEOc reconstructions will be promoted to POc as more Admiralty and Western
Oceanic data become available. Second, it is reasonable to assume that some of our Proto Remote Oceanic and
PEOc etyma are of POc antiquity but happen to have been lost in Proto Admiralty and Proto
Western Oceanic. Without supporting phonological or morphological evidence we are
unwilling to treat Proto Remote Oceanic or PEOc as anything other than convenient hypothetical groups which
allow us to retain conservative criteria for a POc reconstruction.

[15] Bearers of the Lapita culture had settled various parts of the Bismarck Archipelago by around 1400 BC (Specht
     2007) and colonised the Reefs and Santa Cruz Is. in the Temotu Archipelago, Vanuatu and New Caledonia by
     about 1000 BC (Green 2003, Green, Jones & Sheppard 2008, Sand 2001). Maybe a century later they settled in
     Fiji (Nunn et al. 2004, Clark & Anderson 2009). They reached Tonga by 850 BC (Burley & Connaughton
     2007), Samoa by 750 BC (Clark and Anderson 2009).

[16] We included these nodes in the corresponding tree in Figure 1 of volumes 1 and 2, but this was too easily
     interpreted as a statement of our views on subgrouping, so we abandon it here and in Appendix 2.

[17] The term ‘Eastern Oceanic’ and the search for evidence of an Eastern Oceanic subgroup has a relatively long
     pedigree in Oceanic linguistics (Biggs 1965, Pawley 1972, 1977, Lynch & Tryon 1985, Geraghty 1990).
     However, by the time volume 1 of the present work was published in 1998 it was evident that no convincing
     evidence supported an Eastern Oceanic subgroup. Our use of the term here is more inclusive than most,
     resembling the ‘Central/Eastern Oceanic’ of Lynch & Tryon (1983) (the 1985 published version is less
     inclusive) and of Lynch, Ross & Crowley (2002:94–96), who express reservations about its status.

                                                                                       Introduction 17

# FIXME: relabel reconstructions in vol 1 and 2?

    A reconstruction here labelled ‘PROc’ was in volume 1 or 2 labelled ‘PEOc’, but if its
supporting data include no SE Solomonic reflexes, it has the same status as a PROc
reconstruction in volumes 3 and 4 and the present volume. Two factors have led to the
distinction between PEOc and Proto Remote Oceanic in more recent volumes. One is that the historical
separateness of SE Solomonic from both Western Oceanic and the groups treated as Remote
Oceanic has become increasingly clear through recent research (Pawley 2009). The other,
especially relevant to volume 3, is that the primary biogeographic divide in Oceania is
between Near and Remote Oceania (see vol. 2, Map 5), i.e. between the main Solomons
archipelago and the Temotu islands. Whether or not a plant name has a SE Solomonic reflex is
thus significant. Many plant names do not, and are thus attributed in volume 3 to PROc.

    Our criterion for attributing a reconstruction to POc is that the cognate set must occur in at
least two out of four criterial groupings: Admiralties (or Yapese or Mussau), Western Oceanic,
Temotu and our hypothetical Eastern Oceanic. Both here and at the hypothetical interstages
defined above, no reconstruction is made if there are grounds to infer borrowing from one of
these groupings to another.[18] We also reconstruct an etymon to POc if it is reflected in just one
of the four criterial groupings and in a non-Oceanic Austronesian language (a member of one
of the subgroups on the left branches in Figure 1), as illustrated above by the reconstruction of
POc _*apic_ ‘twins’.

    These criteria are identical to those applied in volumes 1 and 2 except for the addition of
Temotu (which figures in few cognate sets). The establishment of Temotu as a primary
subgroup (Ross & Næss 2007) postdates the publication of volumes 1 and 2.

    There are indications that Yapese (a single-language subgroup) and Mussau and Tench (a
subgroup with two closely related languages) may be more closely related to Admiralty than
to any other Oceanic subgroup,[19] and for this reason they are tentatively treated as Admiralty
languages for the purposes of reconstruction. That is, the presence of a reflex in one or more of
these languages and in Admiralty does not support a POc reconstruction, but the presence of of
a reflex in one or more of these languages and one of Western Oceanic, Temotu and Eastern
Oceanic does support one.

    In chapter 2 (§4) of volume 2 Pawley discusses Blust’s (1998a) proposal that the primary
split in Oceanic divides Admiralty from a subgroup embracing all other Oceanic languages.
Pawley dubs the latter ‘Nuclear Oceanic’. If Blust’s subgrouping were accepted, then an
etymon which lacked cognates outside Oceanic would need to be reflected both in an
Admiralties language and in a non-Admiralties language for a POc reconstruction to be made.
Etyma with reflexes in both Western and Eastern Oceanic, but not in the Admiralties, would be
reconstructed as Proto Nuclear Oceanic. Under the criteria outlined above, however, we
attribute these reconstructions to POc. These criteria were used in volumes 1 and 2, and we
have thought it wise to maintain them throughout the volumes of this work. The reader who
wishes to single out reconstructions attributable to a putative Proto Nuclear Oceanic (rather
than to POc) can easily recognise them, however. They are those POc reconstructions for
which (i) there are no Admiralties reflexes, and (ii) there is no higher-order reconstruction (i.e.
PEMP, PCEMP, PMP or PAn), since the latter would be based on cognates outside Oceanic.

[18] Cases where such an inference can be made occur mostly at the boundary (in the Solomon Islands)
     between Western and Eastern Oceanic. Borrowing is likely (and is often reflected in unexpected sound
     correspondences) where an etymon occurs (i) in Western Oceanic and only in SE Solomonic languages
     or (ii) in SE Solomonic languages and only in the NW Solomonic languages (a subgroup within the
     Meso-Melanesian linkage of Western Oceanic).

[19] On the positions of Yapese and Mussau, see respectively Ross (1996a) and Ross (1988:315–316, 331).

1.3.3 Sound correspondences

As we noted above, reconstruction depends on working out the systematic sound correspondences
among cognate vocabulary in contemporary languages and on having a working hypothesis about
how the sounds of POc have changed and are reflected in modern Oceanic languages. Working out
sound correspondences even for twenty languages is a large task, and so we have relied heavily
on our own previous work and the work of others. The sound correspondences we have used
are those given by Ross (1988) for Western Oceanic and Admiralties; by Levy (1979, 1980)
and Lichtenberk (1988) for Cristobal-Malaitan, by Pawley (1972) and Tryon & Hackman (1983)
for SE Solomonic; by Ross & Næss (2007) for Temotu; by Tryon (1976) and Clark (2009)
for North and Central Vanuatu; by Lynch (1978b, 2001c) for Southern Vanuatu; by
Geraghty (1989), Haudricourt & Ozanne-Rivierre (1982), Ozanne-Rivierre (1992, 1995) and
Lynch (2015) for New Caledonia; by Jackson (1986) and Bender et al. (2003) for Nuclear
Micronesian; by Geraghty (1986) for Central Pacific; by Biggs (1978) for Polynesian; by
Ross (1996a) for Yapese; and by Ross (1996b) for Oceanic languages of Irian Jaya.

   For non-Oceanic languages we have referred to sound correspondences given by Tsuchida
(1976) for Formosan languages; by Zorc (1977, 1986) and Reid (1982) for the Philippines; by
Adelaar (1992b) and Nothofer (1975) for Malay and Javanese; by Sneddon (1984) for
Sulawesi; by Collins (1983) for Central Maluku; and by Blust (1978a) for South Halmahera
and Irian Jaya.

   We are aware that regular sound correspondences can be interfered with in various ways:
by phonetic conditioning that the analyst has not identified (see, e.g., Blust (1996a)), by
borrowing (for an extreme Oceanic case, see Grace 1996), or, as recent research suggests, by
the frequency of an item’s use (Bybee 1994). We have tried at least to note, and sometimes to
account for, irregularities in cognate sets.

1.3.4 Proto Oceanic phonology and orthography

1.3.4.1   Reconstructed Proto Oceanic phonology

Work based on the sound correspondences of both Oceanic and non-Oceanic languages has
resulted in the reconstructed paradigm of POc phonemes shown in Table 1. The orthography
used here and in the POc reconstructions in this work is from Ross (1988), with the addition of
_*pʷ_ and _*kʷ_. The terms ‘oral grade’ and ‘nasal grade’ and the relationship of POc phonology to
PMP are discussed in §1.3.4.2.

   Table 2 shows two POc orthographies. The first was established by Biggs (1965), for
PEOc, and Grace (1969), who applied it to POc. It has been used with a number of variants,
separated by a slash in Table 2. The second, introduced by Ross (1988), is the one generally
used in this work. One matter not discussed here is POc stress, for which see Lynch (2000a).

1.3.4.2 The Proto Austronesian and Proto Malayo-Polynesian antecedents of Proto Oceanic phonology

Oceanic languages reflect a set of shared innovations relative to PMP (see Table 3) and it was
on the basis of some of these that Dempwolff (1937) first recognised Oceanic as a major
Austronesian subgroup. The innovations which occurred over the pre-POc period were
mergers and splits, the introduction of new phonemes, and one deletion, as follows:

__block__
a)   The PMP voiced/voiceless pairs _*p_, _*b_ and _*k_, _*g_ merged respectively as early pre-POc
     _*p_ and _*k_. Ozanne-Rivierre (1992) suggests that the corresponding _*t_, _*d_ merger was
     hindered by their mismatch in point of articulation (dental vs alveolar).
b)   The PMP pairs _*s_, _*z_ and _*d_, _*r_ merged respectively as pre-POc _*s_ and _*d_ (phonetically
     probably [r], since Eastern Malayo-Polynesian cognates are liquids).
c)   PMP and a number of its descendants had word-medial homorganic nasal + obstruent
     sequences (not shown in the table). Some instances of the pre-POc word-initial
     obstruents _*p_, _*t_, _*k_, _*d_/_r_, _*s_ and _*j_ also acquired a preceding homorganic nasal (the
     occurrence of this process is unpredictable and its causes largely unknown). These
     sequences became the unitary POc prenasalised voiced obstruents.
d)      The labiovelars _*pʷ_, _*bʷ_, _*mʷ_ and _*kʷ_ entered the language (Blust 1981a, Lynch 2002e,
        Ross 2011). Most of the items containing a labiovelar lack non-Oceanic cognates, and
        some, at least, must have been borrowed into POc from neighbouring Papuan languages.
        For example, it can be argued that *mʷapo(q) ‘taro’ was borrowed by POc speakers as
        they acquired more sophisticated taro-growing techniques from Papuan speakers
        (vol.3:267). A few of these items were inherited into POc, and the labiovelar was the
        reflex of a labial occurring next to a round vowel. However, it is not clear in these items
        that the labiovelar actually occurred in POc. Thus a number of Oceanic languages reflect
        _*tamʷata_ ‘man, husband’, derived from _*tau_ ‘body, person’ + _*mataq_ ‘unripe, immature,
        young’, but we cannot be sure whether this or _*taumata(q)_ was the POc form (§2.2.2.1)
e)      PMP _*h_ was lost in POc.
f)      PMP _*e_, phonetically [ə], became POc _*o_, and the PMP word-final diphthongs _*-uy(-)_,[21]
        _*-aw_ and _*-ay_ were simplified to POc _*-i_, _*-o_ and _*-e_ respectively, the first two thereby
        merging with plain vowels.

The combined effect of (a) and (c) is that each of the PMP pairs _*p_, _*b_ and _*k_, _*g_ first merged
and then split. As a result, for example, PMP _*p_ became either POc _*p_ or POc _*b_, and the
same was true of PMP _*b_, giving the kind of crossover seen in the initial consonants of these
examples:

__tablenh__
PMP *panas ‘hot, warm’          |          POc *panas
PMP *punay ‘wild pigeon’        |          POc *bune
PMP *baqeRuh ‘new’              |          POc *paqoRu
PMP *beRek ‘pig’                |          POc *boRok ‘domestic pig’.

Similarly, either PMP _*k_ or PMP _*g_ could become either POc _*k_ or POc _*g_. For example,

[20] The PAn phoneme represented here as _*L_ is often written _*N_ by Austronesianists, but _*N_ is reserved here for
     the morphological feature described in §1.3.5.6.

[21] The notation _*-uy(-)_ reflects the fact that there is one known case where the change to _*i_ occurred
word-medially: PMP _*kamuihu_ (independent 2PL pronoun) > _*kamuyu_ > POc _*kamiu_.

    An innovation that has come to light during work on these volumes concerns certain PMP
trisyllabic roots with _*-e-_ (*[ə]) as the nucleus of their second syllable. These trisyllables lost _*-e-_
in POc, along with the second consonant of the resulting consonant cluster. Thus PMP _*buteliR_
‘wart’ became POc _*putiR_ (§5.3.2.5). Other etyma where this happened are PMP _*buqeni_, POc
_*puni_ ‘ringworm, Tinea imbricata’ (§5.3.3.2), PMP _*tuqelan_, POc _*tuqan_ ‘bone’ (§3.3.4), PMP
_*baReqaŋ_, POc _*paRa(ŋ)_ ‘molar tooth’ (§3.4.12.5), PMP _*biseqak_ ‘split’, POc _*pisa(k)_~_*pisak-i-_
(vol.1:261), and PMP _*ma-udehi_, POc _*muri_ ‘be behind’ (vol.2:251 and §6.5.3), PMP
_*ma-heyaq_ ‘shy, embarrassed; ashamed’, POc _*maya(q)_ (§11.4.2). The conditioning of this
change remains unclear, as it did not affect PMP _*maqesak_, POc _*maosak_ ‘ripe,
cooked’ (vol.1:157), PMP _*baqeRu_, POc _*paqoRu_ ‘new’ (vol.2:203), PMP _*qateluR_, POc
_*qatoluR_ ‘egg’ (vol.4:278) or PMP _*qulej-an_, _*quloc-a(n)_ ‘maggoty’ (vol.4:415).[22]

1.3.5 Proto Oceanic bound verbal morphology[23]

Because reconstructions in the present volume more often entail POc bound morphemes than
those in previous volumes, this section briefly revisits aspects of POc morphology described in
chapter 2 (§3) of volume 1. This is a consequence of the present volume’s subject matter.
Many of the reconstructions in chapter 3 are of nouns denoting inalienably possessed body-parts
that entail the direct possession construction, which is described in §3.1.1.

    Chapters 4 and 6–11 are overwhelmingly concerned with the reconstruction of verbs
denoting events and states.[24] POc had only a rather small class of adjectives (properly,
adjectival nouns; Ross 1998a), and many states were encoded as verbs. The following
subsections deal briefly with the morphology of POc verb stems. The POc verb complex is
reconstructed by Pawley (2003b). Verbs evidently took a proclitic indexing their subject and, if
transitive, an enclitic indexing their object, e.g. POc _*i=kiniti=au_ ‘he pinched me’ (cf. Manam
_i-ʔint-a_).[25] In many daughter languages these are a prefix and a suffix, and their obligatory
presence is often indicated in cognate-set data by a preceding and following hyphen.

[22] POc _*qaco_ ‘daylight, sun’ (vol.2:153–155) at first sight appears exceptionally to have lost the first consonant of
     the cluster in PMP _*qalejaw_, but there is evidence that it in fact reflected a PAn variant _*qajaw_.

[23] Much of the material in this section is a reduced version of parts of Ross (2004a), to which the reader is
     referred for more detail. Ross (2004a) in turn relies heavily on Evans (2003), a book-length detailed
     treatment of POc bound verbal morphology.

[24] The one earlier chapter in which verbs predominate is chapter 9 of volume 1, which concerns verbs of
     impact, force and change of state.

[25] It is not clear how complete the POc clitic sets were. Evidence is strong that an object enclitic occurred
      only if the object was singular or third person non-singular. If it was first or second person non-singular,
      the object was probably an independent pronoun (Evans 1995). Something similar may have been true
      of subject proclitics.

1.3.5.1 A-verbs, U-verbs and statives

In English—and many other languages—intransitive verbs can be divided into those which
intrinsically only have one participant, like ‘die’, ‘fall’, ‘walk’ and ‘swim’, and those which
could have a second but unspecified participant, like ‘eat [s.t.]’, ‘kick [s.o.]’ and ‘hunt [s.t.]’. In
English an intransitive verb with a second but unspecified participant usually has the actor as
its single argument.[26] One says _John ate_ or _John ate the bread_, but not _*The bread ate_
(meaning that someone ate it). In some Oceanic languages, however, there is a subclass of
intransitive verbs which do work like _ate_ in _*The bread ate_. They denote a semantic relation
with a potential second participant, but the subject of the verb is the undergoer, not the actor, as
in this sentence:

__igt__
     e     gagi a       dovu
     S:3S crush ART sugarcane
     ‘The sugarcane is being crushed.’ (literally ‘The sugarcane crushes’) (Dixon 1988:204)

This and the following examples are from Boumaa Fijian.

   The potential second participant is of course the actor, who emerges in the transitive
version of the verb (which in this—but not every—case has the same form as the intransitive).

__igt__
     au gagi-a          a     dovu.
     S:1S crush-O:3S ART sugarcane
     ‘I’m crushing the sugarcane.’

Intransitive verbs of this kind are here called U-verbs (‘undergoer verbs’). Their existence in
Fijian has long been recognised (Arms 1974a, Biggs 1974, Foley 1976), and has also been
documented for Longgu by Hill (1992) and for Hoava by Davis (2003:113). Evans (2003:26-32)
suggests that U-verbs are quite common in Oceanic languages.

    Some Oceanic languages, like Fijian, have two other subclasses of intransitive verb. One is
the subclass of U-verbs which contains stative or ‘adjectival’ verbs, as in this example:[27]

__igt__
     e     loaloa a           ʔolii ya
     S:3S be.black ART        dog this
     ‘This dog is black.’

These verbs are stative in the sense that they denote states. In actual use, statives were and are
often used inchoatively, i.e. of coming to be in a state. This explains why, for example, *mate
and many of its reflexes mean both ‘be dead’ and ‘die’, as well as ‘be unconscious’ and ‘faint,
become unconscious’ (§4.2.1.2). The difference between stative meaning and inchoative
meaning was and is made by using a verb in differing grammatical constructions. Specifically,
the stative meaning was indicated by a perfective construction, as it is in Sa’a mae ʔoto ‘quite
dead’ and Manam -mate tina ‘dead + intensifier’.

[26] Exceptions are, e.g. The door closed and The vase smashed.

[27] An extensive study of Oceanic stative verbs and adjectives from both typological and diachronic
     perspectives has been published elsewhere (Ross 1998a, 1998c).

                                                                                         Introduction 23


   Contrasting with U-verbs are A-verbs (‘actor verbs’), which resemble English intransitives
in that the actor is the subject both of the intransitive and of its transitive counterpart.[28]

__igt__
a. au      rabe                       b. au rabe-t-a           a          polo
   S:1S    kick                          s:1s kick-TR-O:3S ART            ball
   ‘I’m kicking.’                        ‘I’m kicking the ball.’

Dixon (1988:205) notes that Boumaa Fijian A-verbs are mostly verbs of motion like ‘go’,
‘jump’, ‘creep’, ‘fly’ etc, whereas U-verbs are mostly verbs of affect: ‘crush’, ‘bend’, ‘fold’,
‘squeeze’, ‘tie up’ etc. The same appears to be true of Longgu (Hill 1992). This is noteworthy,
because it means that U-verbs denote semantic relations which one would expect to be
prototypically transitive (Hopper and Thompson 1980) (and they do have transitive
counterparts, as the sugarcane-crushing example illustrates).

   Unfortunately, the data usually do not allow us to distinguish between U- and A-verbs in
our glosses of intransitives, but there are a few exceptions, e.g. POc _*kilat_ (U-verb) ‘be seen
clearly, discerned, recognised’ (§8.2). In many languages it is not clear whether there are U-
verbs. Some sources (e.g. Capell’s 1941 dictionary of Bauan Fijian and Fox’s 1955 dictionary
of Gela) often gloss U-verbs as if they were A-verbs.

   Oceanic languages have an array of valency-changing morphemes, described in §§1.3.5.2–1.3.5.5,
which interact with A- and U-verbs in various ways to shift semantic roles (but only
rarely to add a second object). These are all lexical derivations. In other words, they are
partially unpredictable, and lack the productivity of a voice system.

1.3.5.2 Transitivising morphology: _*-i_ and _*-akin[i]_

POc had two transitivising suffixes (or perhaps enclitics), _*-i_ and _*-akin[i]_. When _*-i_ was
added to an A-verb, its valency was increased by the addition of an object. When it was added
to a U-verb, the undergoer subject became the object and its valency was increased by the
addition of an actor subject, as illustrated in the examples in §1.3.5.1.

    It is somewhat inaccurate, however, to talk about “POc _*-i_”, as the morpheme had a zero
alternant. POc verb roots were mostly disyllabic and either consonant-final or vowel-final, that
is, (C)V(C)VC or (C)V(C)V. The canonic shape of the root alone determined its transitive
form. The transitive of a consonant-final root was formed with _*-i_, but with a vowel-final root
like _*wase-_ ‘share (s.t.) out’ or _*kati-_ ‘husk (s.t.) with teeth’, no transitive suffix occurred and
the object enclitic was added directly to the root (Evans 1995, 2003:96-99, 106-118). A
probable exception were roots ending in _*-a_, where the suffix _*-i-_ may have occurred between
the root and the object enclitic, at least when the enclitic itself began with _*a_ (_*=au_ o:1s,
_*=a_ o:3s). In Table 4 are some reconstructed POc A- verbs and U-verbs, both consonant-final and
vowel-final, with their corresponding transitives.

    POc _*-akin[i]_ was an applicative suffix which increased the valency of an intransitive verb
by the addition of an object (or in some cases perhaps simply replaced _*-i_ on a transitive verb
that no longer had an intransitive counterpart). Whereas the object of a verb formed with _*-i_
(or zero) was typically a patient or location, however, the object of a verb formed with _*-akin[i]_
typically had some other semantic role. With a verb of movement, for example, it was
an entity that accompanied the actor, e.g. Bauan Fijian _ðiði_ ‘run’, _ðiðiv-i_ ‘run to’, _ðiðiv-aki_
run off with (s.t.)’ (§6.6). With a verb of cognition or emotion it was a cause or stimulus, e.g.
Bauan Fijian leva ‘be angry’, _levað-i_ ‘be angry with (s.o)’, _levat-aki_ ‘be angry about (what s.o.
has done)’. With a verb of bodily emission it was the emitted substance, e.g. Bauan Fijian _lua_
‘vomit’, _luað-a_ ‘vomit on s.t.’, _luar-ak-a_ ‘vomit s.t. up’ (§4.4.4).

[28] Classes of this kind were first reconstructed for POc by Pawley (1973:128), whose A-class and B-class
     statives correspond respectively to the stative and U-verb classes reconstructed here. He subdivides
     A-verbs into various semantic subclasses.

   We follow Evans (2003) in reconstructing _*-akin[i]_, indicating that the morpheme had two
forms, _*-aki(n)_ and _*-akini_, formally parallel to the alternation between intransitive and
transitive forms with consonant-final roots in Table 4 (Clark 1973). Indeed, there is good
evidence that _*-akin[i]_ was once a verb. The final _*-n_ of the _*-aki(n)_ variant is, however,
nowhere preserved. Instead, we find _-aki_, _-aʔi_ and other such reflexes, reduced in some
Oceanic languages (e.g. Tawala [PT]) to _-e_.

   In POc, _*-i_ and _*-akin[i]_ were often added to an intransitive root with a final consonant,
like _*taŋis_ ‘weep’, but in many Oceanic languages word-final consonants have been lost, with
the result that when the ancient consonant is retained before a transitive affix it is interpreted as
part of the suffix, as in Wayan Fijian _taŋi_ ‘weep’ vs _taŋi-ði-_ ‘cry for (s.o.)’ and _taŋi-ðakini-_ ‘cry
about (s.t.)’. This has had the consequence that, at least in SE Solomonic and Fijian languages,
the inherited consonant has been replaced by another consonant, as in the verbs above derived
from Bauan Fijian _leva_ and _lua_.

   Table 5 summarises the valency-changing devices putatively used with the three POc verb
classes. This situation remains more or less unchanged in many daughter languages. Column 2
indicates a difference between U-verbs and statives: a transitive verb could be formed with _*-i_
from either an A-verb or a U-verb, but a transitive could be formed from a stative only with
one of the causative prefixes _*pa-_ and _*paka-_, which are the topic of the next subsection.

1.3.5.3 Causativising morphology: _*pa-_ and _*paka-_

POc causatives were formed with one of the two widely reflected prefixes _*pa-_ and _*paka-_,
usually accompanied by the transitiviser _*-i_. A given Oceanic language reflects either _*pa-_ or
_*paka-_, but not both. This is curious, as it compels us to reconstruct two POc prefixes with
apparently the same function. However, the history of the two forms is well known. In PAn
and PMP _*pa-ka-_ causativised stative or non-agentive verbs (_*ka-_ marked a verb stem as
stative or non-agentive: see §1.3.5.4), whereas _*pa-_ causativised dynamic, agentive verbs
(Zeitoun & Huang 2000, Ross 2015). The fact that their reflexes are in contrast in no known
Oceanic language indicates that when POc broke up, the distinction between them had been
lost but the two forms continued to coexist.

    Table 5 shows that causatives could be formed from all three POc verb classes. Indeed, this
was the only way that a transitive verb could be formed from a stative. The causative adds an
actor argument, the causer, to the verb, as these Boumaa Fijian examples show. The verb _vuli_
‘learn’ in (a) is an A-verb, so its actor subject is the same as that of the transitive in (b). The
causative in (c) introduces the causer argument _o Jone_ ‘John’, and the actor becomes its object.
The object of (b), ‘arithmetic’, is an oblique in both the intransitive of (a) and the causative of

__igt__
(c).
a. au sā        vuli (i-na      fika)
   S:1S ASP learn PREP-ART arithmetic
   ‘I am learning (about arithmetic).’
b. au sā        vuli-ŋa        a          fika
   S:1S ASP learn-TR:O:3S ART             arithmetic
   ‘I am learning arithmetic.’

   s:3s ASP CAUS-learn-TR O:1S ART John PREP-ART arithmetic
   ‘John is teaching me (arithmetic).’ (Dixon 1988:50)

In (d) the verb ʔau ‘take, carry’ is a U-verb, so its subject ‘letter’ in (a) becomes the object of
the transitive in (b) and of the causative in (c).

__igt__
d. e     ʔau yane          a     ivola
   s:1s take thither ART letter
   ‘The letter is being taken/sent.’
e. e    ʔaut-a yane            a       ivola a      ðauravou
   s:1s take-o:3s thither      ART     letter ART   youth
   ‘The youth is taking the letter.’
f. e     vaʔa-ʔau-t-a yane       a      ivola a       marama
   s:1s CAUS-take-O:3S thither ART letter ART woman
   ‘The woman is posting (= causing to be sent) the letter.’ (Dixon 1988:185)

Boumaa Fijian, like many other Oceanic languages, has no ditransitive verbs, so one of the
three roles potentially associated with the causative must become an oblique or disappear, as
happens in (c) and (f).

   The situation described with regard to transitivisation and causativisation in Boumaa Fijian also
holds with various complications or simplifications in many other Oceanic languages and
presumably did so in POc.

1.3.5.4 Detransitivising morphology: reduplication, _*ma-_/_*ka-_, _*ta-_ and _*paRi-_

Detransitivising morphology took four forms in POc: reduplication and the prefixes
_*ma-_/_*ka-_, _*ta-_ and _*paRi-_. Only _*paRi-_ remained as productive in POc as the transitivising and
causativising morphology described in the two preceding subsections. It formed reciprocals,[29]
and reflexes occasionally appear in the data, and are marked ‘reciprocal’ accordingly.

    The other three pieces of detransitivising morphology shared the function of reducing a
verb’s valency from two to one. Reduplication turned a transitive into an A-verb
(Evans 2003:81–84, 301). This was perhaps the most productive of POc’s detransitiving stategies, as
Evans reports a number of languages reflecting an apparent POc _*kani-kani_ (VI) ‘eat’, from
_*kani_ (VT) ‘eat’, in competition with inherited _*paŋan_ (VI) ‘eat’, discussed in §1.3.5.5.

    On Evans’ analysis (2003:268–279, 300), POc _*ma-_ had several functions. One was to turn
a transitive into a U-verb, e.g. POc _*ma-kini(t)_ ‘be stung, have a stinging pain’ (§5.3.2.3), from
POc _*kinit_, _*kinit-i-_ ‘to pinch, nip’ (vol.1:280). Another was to form a stative from a dynamic
verb or perhaps a noun, e.g. POc _*ma-raqu_ ‘be thirsty’ (§4.3.3.2), _*ma-draRa(q)_ ‘be bloody,
bleed’ (§4.4.1), _*ma-ridriŋ_ ‘be cold’ (§4.8.1), _*ma-saki(t)_ (V) ‘be in pain, sick’ (§5.3.1),
_*matakut_ (VI) ‘be afraid’ (§11.4.1). In this function _*ka-_ alternated with _*ma-_ in POc, the
outcome of a productive PMP alternation explained in §1.3.5.5, but it seems that neither was
productive by the time POc broke up. The prefix _*ma-_ is also found in a small number of non-stative
intransitives with an experiencer subject, and the following are reconstructed in ch.4:
POc _*ma-soru_ ‘hiccup’ (§4.3.7.1), _*ma-ñawa_ ‘breathe’ (§4.5.1), _*mawap_ ‘yawn’ (§4.5.6),
_*ma-turu(R)_ ‘sleep, be asleep’ (§4.6.1).

    The functions of _*ta-_ were similar to those of _*ma-_, but with three differences. First, a
U-verb with _*ta-_ denoted an action or state that had seemingly occurred without the intervention
of an agent, whereas _*ma-_ remained unspecified with regard to agency. Second, _*ta-_ appears
to have been productive in POc, as it remains productive in some modern languages (Evans 2003:289–300).
Reflexes of _*ta-_ crop up in the data, but rarely in reconstructions, e.g. POc
_*ta-lili_ ‘be dizzy’ (§5.3.16), _*ta-bulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round, turn back’, spontaneous derivative of
_bulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn round, turn back’ (§6.4.2).

1.3.5.5 Malayo-Polynesian fossils: verbal morphology

A number of Malayo-Polynesian fossils occur in the POc reconstructions in this volume. They
are fossils in the sense that by the break-up of POc they were apparently fully integrated into
the POc stems in which they are reflected, appear only sporadically, and had no productive
function. Nonetheless, knowledge of parts of the verbal system of PMP is necessary to
understanding how these forms came to be present in POc.[30]

[29] The functions of *paRi- were more complex than this: see Lichtenberk (2000).

[30] What we reconstruct as POc is the language at the point that it broke up, i.e. when innovations no longer
     spread across the whole speech community (Pawley 2008). It is possible, perhaps probable, that the
     PMP features described in this subsection survived productively in the Austronesian language of those
     who settled in the Bismarck Archipelago, but lost productivity shortly before the break-up. However,
     papers by van den Berg & Boerger (2011) and Næss (2015) suggest that a more PMP-like system than
     we reconstruct continued on beyond the break-up. This raises questions that need further research, but
     we think it unlikely that the answers will have a radical effect on our reconstructions.

    The relevant feature of the PMP system is a contrast between two voices.[31] The English
voice system distinguishes between a transitive active voice (e.g. _The chicken bit a mango_)
and an intransitive passive voice (_The mango was bitten [by the chicken]_). The PMP voice
system was organised differently. It had a transitive undergoer voice, i.e. the undergoer was the
subject and the actor was marked as genitive (‘be-bitten of-the chicken the mango’). There
was also an intransitive actor voice, i.e. the actor was subject and the undergoer, if any, was in
an oblique case (‘bit the chicken [at a mango]’).[32] This system is maintained in most languages
of the Philippines, where specialists have labelled this kind of voice system a ‘focus’ system.
The contrast between the English and PMP voice systems is presented in Table 6.

    One would predict from this configuration that PMP actor-voice verbs gave rise to POc
intransitives, while PMP undergoer-voice verbs became POc transitives, and, as Table 6
implies, this prediction is fulfilled, but with certain qualifications. Table 6 also indicates that at
some point between the break-up of PMP and the emergence of POc, transitive clause
structure was realigned so that the PMP (undergoer) subject became the POc object and the
PMP genitive actor was reanalysed as the subject.

    Table 7 shows the parts of the PMP voice paradigm that are relevant to POc. Forms in the
grey cells did not survive as verbal morphemes in POc.33 PMP had three sets of undergoer
voices, marking the subject as semantic patient, location, and instrument or beneficiary
respectively. PMP dependent forms occurred after an auxiliary, and it is these that have
become the default POc forms.

[31] A wider-ranging account of the PMP verbal system and its development up to the break-up of POc is
     given in Lynch et al. (2002:57–63).

[32] The pseudo-English glosses do not work well, as ‘be-bitten’ is English intransitive passive, whereas the
     PMP verb form was transitive.

[33] All PMP independent undergoer voice forms also functioned as nominalisers, and <in>√, √-an, <in>√-an
     and i-√ retained this (apparently productive) function in POc. √-en is reflected only as a fossil.

28 Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond


    The typical POc intransitive is a plain or reduplicated root reflecting the PMP actor voice
dependent form. The patient and location undergoer voice forms merged at some pre-POc
stage, so that the location form *√-i became the POc transitive suffix, as described in §1.3.5.2.
The PMP instrument/beneficiary undergoer voice form _*√-áni_[34] became a POc applicative
_*-ani_, reflected in various Admiralties languages and Meso-Melanesian languages of New
Ireland.[35] However, in a far larger number of Oceanic languages it has been replaced by POc
_*-akin[i]_, the origin of which is far from obvious, despite widespread reflexes in non-Oceanic
Malayo-Polynesian languages (Evans 2003:157–170, Ross 2002).

    The PMP dependent forms mentioned in the previous paragraph evidently remained
productive in POc. The evidence suggests that the PMP independent forms that survived
into POc were restricted in function and that the undergoer voice forms √_-an_ and _*<in>_√
did not participate in realignment, becoming passives in scattered Oceanic languages.[36]
Thus in clauses where these forms occurred, the PMP transitive construction V AGENITIVE
USUBJ noted in Table 6 became V USUBJ. Allomorphs of the PMP actor voice form
_*<um>_√, meanwhile, survived as a fossil in various POc verbs, listed in Table 8. There
were several such allomorphs. The infix *<um> itself does not appear in POc forms, with
two possible grey-shaded WOc exceptions. Instead, the survivors are allomorphs that are more
readily reanalysed as part of the root. With a vowel-initial root, infix *<um> became prefix
_*[u]m-_, and with a labial-initial root, infix _*<um>_ also became _*m-_ but here replacing the initial
labial. There is just one example of the latter, at the bottom of Table 8.[37]

[34] Wolff (1973) and others since have reconstructed the PAn/PMP suffix as *-án, reflected in Puyuma and
     Paiwan (both Formosan) and in Philippine languages, but PMP *-án-i can be reconstructed with
     confidence, as it is reflected in Tsou, Saaroa, Saisiyat, Atayal and Seediq (all Formosan) and in Oceanic
     languages. There is also paradigmatic evidence for *-án-i (Ross 2009:300–301).

[35] Reflexes of POc *-ani are found in the Admiralties languages Lou, Titan, Kele, Loniu and Nyindrou and
     in Meso-Melanesian languages of New Ireland Tigak, Kara, Tabar, Lihir, Barok, Patpatar and Tolai.

[36] Passives reflecting an allomorph of *<in> are found in Bola (MM), Nakanai (MM), and Natügu (TM)
     (van den Berg & Boerger 2011). Passives reflecting *-an occur in Bali-Vitu (MM) (van den Berg 2007),
     Kara (MM) (Schlie 1984, Dryer 2013), Raga (NCV) (Walsh 1966, Crowley 2002c), Abma (NCV)
     (Schneider 2010:56–57, 2011).

[37] POc *muni may reflect *N + puni (§1.3.5.6) rather than *m-uni.

   Not surprisingly, the perfective infix *<in> occurs less often in lexicalised forms. The two
possible cases are shown in Table 9, neither of them entirely convincing.

1.3.5.6 Malayo-Polynesian fossils: verbal derivations

PMP also had certain derivational prefixes that were attached to roots to form stems to which
the voice morphology of Table 7 then applied. Two of these, *ka- and *paN-, play a significant
role in POc reconstruction.

    The POc detransitivising morpheme *ma-, at least in its stative function (§1.3.5.4),
reflected an ancient (pre-PAn) combination of *<um> intransitive + *ka- stative. As a result
POc has occasional *ka-/*ma- alternants, e.g. POc *ka-(r,R)aŋo ‘be dry, be low tide’ vs
*[ma]Raŋo ‘become withered’ (vol.2:220) and POc *ka-uRi- vs POc *ma-wiRi, both ‘left-
hand, be on the left; left side or direction’ (§3.6.3).

    More widely reflected is the PMP verb-deriving prefix *paN- and its allomorph *N-. Its
history and function are unclear, other than that it formed dynamic verbs. It is barely present in
Formosan languages, but ubiquitous in conservative Malayo-Polynesian languages.[39] The *N
symbol here indicates a process that replaces a root-initial voiceless obstruent with a
homorganic nasal, and places a homorganic nasal before a voiced obstruent and *-ŋ- before a
root-initial vowel (Blust 2004). Reflexes of both *paN- and *N- occur in POc, with no
discernible conditioning or difference in function. Systemically, a PMP stem with *paN- or
*N- occupied the dependent actor-voice slot in Table 7, i.e. the slot from which POc
intransitives were derived. The corresponding PMP independent actor-voice form was *maN-,
which, like *<um>, is rarely reflected in POc. Reconstructed POc verbs that include these
morphemes are shown in Table 10.


1.4       Conventions common to the series

1.4.1 Presentation of reconstructions

Each of the contributions to these volumes concerns a particular POc ‘terminology’.
Generally, each contribution begins with an introduction to the issues raised by the
reconstruction of its particular terminology, and the bulk of each contribution consists of
reconstructed etyma with supporting data and a commentary on matters of meaning and form.

    The reconstruction of POc *[ma]saki(t) (v) ‘be in pain, sick’; (N) ‘sickness’ below, adapted
from Chapter 5, shows how reconstructions and supporting cognate sets are presented. Above
it is a superordinate (PMP) reconstruction drawn from Blust’s Austronesian Comparative
Dictionary (ACD; see §1.2). Below it are supporting reflexes. Chapters vary in the degree to
which lower-order reconstructions like PSV *a-misa below are included. Lower-order
reconstructions are sometimes given to clarify the relationship of reflexes to the higher-order
reconstruction: Southern Vanuatu languages, for example, have undergone so much
phonological change that a Proto Southern Vanuatu reconstruction helps explicate the
relationship between Southern Vanuatu reflexes and the POc reconstruction. Sometimes a
lower-order reconstruction displays an extension of meaning or some other semantic change.

[39] Kaufman (2009) suggests that a trigger for its proliferation was the ambiguity of multifunctional PMP
     *ma-, which occurred on both stative and dynamic verbs.

                                                                                  Introduction 31



Because our supporting data are drawn from such a wide range of languages, the convention is
adopted of prefixing each language name with the abbreviation for the genealogical or
geographic group to which the language belongs, so that the distribution of a cognate set is
more immediately obvious. Table 11 is a key to the labels. Figure 2 shows the positions of
these groups in the Oceanic tree. We have sought to be consistent in always listing these
groups in the same order, but contributors vary in the ordering of languages within groups.

    Lynch’s recent research on Southern Oceanic (§1.3.2.3) renders the NCV group mildly
anomalous, although there is no doubt that it reflects an integrated dialect network. There are a
number of etyma whose reflexes are confined to North and Central Vanuatu, and so we
continue to include ‘Proto North/Central Vanuatu’ reconstructions, even though these perhaps
represent a Southern Oceanic term that has been lost in southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia.
Where the distribution of reflexes requires it, the chapters in this volume include
reconstructions for Proto Remote Oceanic and for PSOc. Etyma with these distributions were attributed to
PEOc in volumes 1 and 2, but the distributions are transparent, thanks to the presence of the
group labels in cognate sets.

    In the interests of space we have not given the history of the reconstructions themselves, as
this would often require commentary on the modifications made by others and by us, and on
why we have made them. Where a reconstruction is not new, we have tried to give its earliest
source, e.g. ‘ACD’ above, but this is difficult when earlier reconstructions differ in form and
meaning.

[40] e.g. mahaki-kili ‘skin disease’, mahaki-mata ‘eye disease’, mahaki hela ‘asthma’, mahaki moa
     ‘epilepsy, be epileptic’.

[41] e.g. masaki tinaʔe ‘stomach ache, masaki tuʔa ‘backache’, masaki niho ‘toothache’, masaki ɣotoi
     ‘epilepsy; flinching sickness’.

    In general, the contributions to these volumes are concerned with items reconstructable in
POc, PWOc, PEOc, Proto Remote Oceanic and occasionally Proto New Guinea Oceanic (PNGOc). Etyma for
PWOc, PNGOc and PEOc are reconstructed because these may well also be POc etyma for
which known reflexes are not well distributed (see discussion in §1.3.2.4). Reconstructions for
lower-order interstages are decreasingly likely to reflect POc etyma and may be the results of
cultural change as Oceanic speakers moved further out into the Pacific.

    Contributors to these volumes have usually not sought to make fresh reconstructions at
interstages superordinate to POc. What they have done, however, is to cite other scholars’
reconstructions for higher-order interstages, as these represent a summary of the non-Oceanic
evidence in support of a given POc reconstruction. These interstages are shown in Figure 1,
together with their abbreviations.

    Sometimes non-Oceanic evidence has been found to support a POc reconstruction where
no reconstruction at a higher-level interstage has previously been made. In this case a new
higher-order reconstruction is made, and the non-Oceanic evidence is given in a footnote.

    Whilst we have tried to use the internal organisation of the lexicons of Oceanic languages
themselves as a guide in setting the boundaries of each terminology, we have inevitably taken
decisions which differ from those that others might have made. There are, obviously, overlaps
and connections between various semantic domains and therefore between the contributions
here. We have done our best to provide cross-references, but we have sometimes duplicated
information rather than ask the reader repeatedly to look elsewhere in the book. Indexes at the
end of each volume and in the final volume are intended to make it easier to use the volumes
collectively as a work of reference.

1.4.2 Data

Data sources are listed in Appendix 1.

    For some reconstructed etyma only a representative sample of reflexes is given. We have
endeavoured to ensure, however, that in each case this sample not only is geographically and
genetically representative, but also provides evidence to justify the shape of the reconstruction.
Where only a few reflexes are known to us, this is usually noted.

    Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages from
which data are cited here, all data are transcribed as far as possible into a standard phonemic
orthography based on that used by Ross (1988:3–4) in order to facilitate comparison.[42] This
means, for example, that the _j_ of the German-based orthographies of Yabem and Gedaged
becomes _y_, Yabem _c_ becomes _ʔ_, Gedaged _z_ becomes _ɬ_ and so on; the _ng_ of English-based
orthographies becomes _ŋ_; and Fijian _g_, _q_ and _c_ become _ŋ_, _g_ and _ð_ respectively.

    The following symbols have more or less their usual IPA values:
_ð_, _ɢ_, _ɣ_, _h_, _k_, _l_, _ʟ_, _ɬ_, _ʎ_, _m_, _n_,
_ŋ_, _ñ_, _p_, _q_, _χ_, _ɾ_, _r_, _s_, _t_, _w_, _x_, _z_, _ʔ_, _a_, _æ_, _e_, _ɛ_, _ə_, _i_, _ɨ_,
_o_, _œ_, _ɔ_, _ʌ_, _u_, _ʉ_, _ɯ_. As far as possible, however,
our orthography is phonemic and does not show allophonic variation, so that there are
instances where a symbol does not have its usual phonetic value. For example, Wayan Fijian _k_
is a voiceless stop word-initially but [k] is in free or stylistic variation with [ɣ] word-medially.
The voiced stops _b_, _d_, _g_ and the voiced bilabial trill _ʙ_ are prenasalised in some languages, but
prenasalisation is not written unless it is phonemically distinctive. Where a language has just
one rhotic, we usually write r, despite the fact that that rhotic is sometimes a flap. Other
orthographic symbols (with values in IPA) are:

__tablenh__
      _f_   |  [ɸ, f]      |   voiceless bilabial or (less often) labio-dental fricative
      _v_   |  [β, v]      |   voiced bilabial or (less often) labio-dental fricative
      _c_   |  [ts], [ʧ]   |   voiceless alveolar or palatal affricate
      _j_   |  [ʣ], [ʤ]    |   voiced alveolar or palatal affricate
      _y_   |  [j]         |   palatal glide
      _dr_  |  [ⁿr]        |   prenasalised voiced alveolar trill (as in Fijian)
      _ö_   |  [ø]         |   rounded mid front vowel
      _ü_   |  [y]         |   rounded high front vowel

Other superscripts and diacritics are as follows:

__block__
- contrastive long vowels are represented by a macron, e.g. _ā_;
- contrastive vowel nasalisation is represented by a tilde, e.g. _ã_;
- labialisation is marked by a superscript _w_, e.g. _pʷ_;
- velarisation is marked by a superscript _ɯ_, e.g. _pᵚ_;
- contrastive aspiration is marked by a superscript _h_, e.g. _pʰ_;
- apicolabials are represented by the corresponding apical symbol and the linguolabial
  diacritic (the ‘seagull’), e.g. _t̼_;
- retroflexes are represented by the corresponding apical symbol with a dot beneath,
  e.g. _ṛ_.

[42] The main reason for retaining Ross’ orthography was that the electronic files initially used in this project
     were drawn in large part from those used in the research reported in Ross (1988).

Except for inflexional morphemes, non-cognate portions of reflexes, i.e. derivational
morphemes and non-cognate parts of compounds, are shown in parentheses (…). Where an
inflexional morpheme is an affix or clitic and can readily be omitted, its omission is indicated
by a hyphen at the beginning or end of the base. This applies particularly to possessor suffixes
on directly possessed nouns (vol.1, ch.2, §3.2). Where an inflexional morpheme cannot readily
be omitted, then it is separated from its base by a hyphen. This may happen because of
complicated morphophonemics or because the morpheme is always present, like the adjectival
_-n_ in some NNG and Admiralties languages and prefixed reflexes of the POc article _*na_ in
scattered languages. When a reflex is itself polymorphemic (i.e. the morphemes reflect
morphemes present in the reconstructed etymon) or contains a reduplication, the morphemes
or reduplicates are also separated by a hyphen.

    Languages from which data are cited in this volume are listed in Appendix B in their
subgroups (proper or otherwise), together with an index allowing the reader to find the
subgroup to which a given language belongs. Appendix B also includes alternative language
names. The difficulty of deciding where the borderline between dialect and language lies,
combined with the fact that these volumes contain work by a number of contributors, has
resulted in some inconsistency in the naming of dialects in the cognate sets. Some occur in the
form ‘Lukep (Pono)’, i.e. the Pono dialect of the Lukep language, whilst others are represented
simply by the dialect name, e.g. Iduna, noted in Appendix B as ‘Iduna (= dialect of
Bwaidoga)’.

1.4.3 Conventions used in representing reconstructions

Reconstructions are marked with an asterisk, e.g. _*manuka_ ‘ulcer, sore, wound’, a standard
convention in historical linguistics. POc reconstructions, and also PWOc and PNGOc
reconstructions, are given in the orthography of §1.3.4. For reconstructions at higher-order
interstages the orthographies are those used by Blust in his various publications and the ACD.
Reconstructions at lower-order interstages are given in the standard orthography used for data
(§4.2). Geraghty’s (1986) PCP orthography, for example, based on Standard Fijian spelling, is
converted into our standard orthography in the same way as Fijian spelling is. In practice, this
means that the orthographies for PEOc, Proto Remote Oceanic and PCP are the same as for POc, except that a
distinction between _*p_ and _*v_ is recognised and _*R_ is generally absent from PCP.[43] Biggs and
Clark’s PPn reconstructions are in any case written in an orthography identical to our standard.
Bracketing and segmentation conventions in protoforms are shown in Table 12.

: Table 12       Bracketing and segmentation conventions in protoforms

__tablenh__
        (x)         |  it cannot be determined whether x was present
         (x,y)      |  either x or y was present
         [x]        |  the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with and one without x
         [x,y]      |  the item is reconstructable in two forms, one with x and one with y
         x-y        |  x and y are separate morphemes
         x-         |  x takes an enclitic or a suffix
         <x>        |  x is an infix

[43] Geraghty (1990:91) records a small number of cases where certain Fijian dialects retain POc _*R_ as _l_,
     indicating that it was retained sporadically in PCP. It is always lost in his ‘Tokalau Fijian’ and in Polynesian.

                                                                                     Introduction 35


     PMP final consonants are usually retained in POc in absolute word-final position. In many
cases decisive evidence for retention or loss can be found in those Oceanic languages that
usually retain final consonants. However, there are some cases where it is uncertain whether
POc kept the PMP finals. This is so when a PMP etymon is not attested in an Oceanic
language that consistently retains POc final consonants. An example is _*-d_ in PMP _*palahud_
‘go down to the sea or coast’, a term reflected in Oceanic only in languages that regularly lose
POc final consonants. In such cases the consonant is reconstructed in parentheses, e.g. POc
_*palau(r)_ ‘go to sea, make a sea voyage’.

     In presenting words that display anomalies of form, it is often necessary to posit an
expected form. For example, the Longgu term dau ‘hang down; drop anchor’ is presented in
support of POc _*tau(r)_ ‘hang, be suspended’ (§6.2.4.3). Given the reconstruction, however, we
would expect the Longgu form to be _tau_. In this volume we use a less widely employed
convention and mark expected forms with a dagger, e.g. ‘_d-_ for †_t-_’ or ‘†_tau_’, to distinguish
them both from reconstructions and real data.[44]

     Sometimes we need to refer to a reconstructed form that one would expect as the regular
reflex of an established POc etymon, but which does not occur because an irregular sound
change has occurred. In such cases the dagger and asterisk conventions are used together. For
example, in §3.3.9, we reconstruct PNCV _*kaRo_ ‘vine, rope; vein’. It is descended, however,
from POc _*waRo(c)_ ‘vine, creeper; string, rope; vein, tendon’, and the expected PNCV form,
referred to in our discussion there, would be †_*waRo_. The dagger marks it as expected but not
attested to.

     When historical linguists compile cognate sets they commonly retain word for word the
glosses given in the sources from which the items are taken. However, again in the interests of
standardisation, we have often reworded (and sometimes abbreviated) the glosses of our
sources, while preserving the meaning. Where glosses were in a language other than English
we have translated them. In the interests of space and legibility, and because data often have
multiple sources, we have given the source of a reflex only when it is not included in the
listings in Appendix A.

     Sometimes we use the convention of providing no gloss beside the items in a cognate set
whose gloss is identical to that of the POc (or other lower-order) reconstruction at the head of
the set, i.e. the reconstruction which they reflect.

     Where necessary, we use ‘(N)’ to indicate that a gloss is a noun, and ‘(V)’, ‘(VI)’, or ‘(VT)’ to
indicate that it is a verb, intransitive verb or transitive verb. Because in many environments
transitive verbs were regularly formed from the intransitive stem by adding the suffix _*-i-_
(§1.3.5.2), in many cases the intransitive and transitive verbs are simply shown in sequence,
e.g. POc _*qalo(p)_, _*qalop-i-_ ‘beckon with the palm downward, wave’. In such cases, the first
verb is always intransitive, the second (in _*-i-_) transitive.

     Within glosses we use the conventional abbreviations ‘k.o.’ (as in ‘k.o. yam’) for ‘kind of’,
‘s.o.’ for ‘someone’ and ‘s.t.’ for ‘something’.

     In putting together cognate sets we have quite often found possible cognates which do not
quite ‘fit’ the set: they display unexplained phonological irregularities or their meaning is just a
little too different from the rest of the set for us to assume cognacy. Rather than eliminate them
we often include them below the cognate set under the rubric ‘cf. also’.

[44] Another convention sometimes used for this purpose is a double asterisk, e.g. **tau: we prefer the
     dagger on aesthetic grounds.

1.5 Indexes

This volume has three indexes. The first, as in volumes 1–4, is an index of reconstructions
arranged by their protolanguages. The second, as in volumes 3 and 4, is an alphabetical list of
reconstructions. The third is an index to the English glosses.





2              People: gender, age cohorts and marital status

2.1    Introduction

A volume entitled ‘Body and mind’ and devoted to the human person would not be complete
without a chapter on words for people. This chapter, however, is restricted to terms for people
classified by gender, age cohort and marital status. Terms for kinship and affinal relations and
for social rank and leadership will be included in volume 6.

    In §2.2 terms for ‘person’ are presented, in §2.3 and §2.4 terms for people classified
respectively by gender and by age cohort, in §2.5 terms for people who lack a certain kinship
relation, i.e. a woman with no children, a child with no parents, and an adult who has not
married or whose spouse has died. In §2.6 terms for twins are given.

    Terms for ‘person’, ‘man’, ‘woman’ and ‘child’ are readily reconstructable. It is evident that
Oceanic languages had a number of other terms related to age, and status based on marriage
and childbearing. In all Oceanic societies the transition, for both male and female, from
childhood to adolescence or marriageable age, and then from the single to the married state, is
observed both terminologically and ceremonially (Pawley 1982b:269-70).

    In Manam (NNG), for example, boys are called _nat_ until around 15 years of age. When
their hair has been cut (second stage of initiation) they are called _amuna_. This will continue
until they marry, when they become _tamoat_. In old age men are called _imanei_ and finally
_ikamoan_ (Böhm 1983:239).

    A small girl in Manam is also called _nat_. As a young marriageable woman she is _barasi_. A
married woman is called _aine_. If she remains unmarried she is called _kosikosi_; if her husband
dies the term for a widow is _ŋiŋar_. When she is around 50 years old she is designated
_ain molmolu_. An old woman is _ain ikib_ or _manei_. Manam also has terms for a woman’s status in
terms of number of children: _biau_ ‘woman with one child’, _pagar_ ‘woman with two or more children’,
_kupi_ ‘childless or sterile woman’ (Böhm 1983, wordlist).

    In To’aba’ita (SES), _wane_ is the male gender marker and _kini_ or _ai_ the female. _Wela_ is the
name for a child regardless of sex, even if one quite big, as long as not married. A newly-married
man is _wane fālu_, a newly-married woman _kini fālu_. A married person is _gʷauliʔi wane_ or
_gʷauliʔi ai_. The addition of _-ʔa_ to these last two terms means they are ‘somewhat
old’ (Lichtenberk 2008).

2.2      Person

There are five POc reconstructions whose reflexes suggest a meaning ‘person’ (Pawley 1985):

__block__
-     _*tau_ ‘person in any form, including ghosts and supernatural person-like beings’
-     _*tamʷataq ‘living person’ (contrasting with _*tau-mate_ ‘dead person’)
-     _*qata_ ‘person’
-     _*tinoni_ ‘person, people’
-     _*(k,kʷ)a(i)-_ ‘person’

Reflexes of these terms show differences in geographical distribution. Languages of the
Southeast and Northwest Solomons reflect _*tinoni_ ‘person, people’ (this distribution may be
due to local contact), while languages of Vanuatu and New Caledonia have reflexes of POc
_*qata_. POc _*tau-_ and _*qata-_ are also frequently used in compounds.


2.2.1 POc _*tau_

  PAn _*Cau_ ‘person’ is a well attested reconstruction, continued as PMP and POc _*tau_.
Reflexes of POc _*tau_ occur in three structural contexts:

__block__
-     as an independent lexical item, typically meaning ‘man’ or ‘person’ (§2.2.1.1);
-     as the first item of a compound (§2.2.1.2);
-     as the root of a pronominal form (§2.2.1.3).

The evidence for each of these is discussed below.


2.2.1.1 Unbound reflexes of POc _*tau_ ‘person’

   In some North New Guinea and Papuan Tip languages (and perhaps in Gela), a reflex of
POc _*tau_ may stand alone. Elsewhere reflexes are found only in compounds or pronominals.
POc _*tau_ occurred in a considerable number of compounds, and it was a natural process for
one of these compounds to become the basic term for ‘person’, displacing _*tau_, especially
because ‘living person’ was always in opposition to ‘spirit, ghost’. In Mussau, for example,
where _tau_ occurs in compounds, the standalone form for ‘person’ is _tau-matu_, i.e. a compound
has replaced _tau_.

   The gloss offered below from Pawley (1985) takes account of the three types of reflex
mentioned above.

Bender et al. (2003) reconstruct PMic _*tau_ ‘person’, but it appears that Micronesian reflexes
only occur in the compounds listed here. The first element of the reflexes below is different in
form from the reflexes of prefixed PMic _*tawu-_, which remain productive in a number of
languages, as illustrated in §2.2.1.2.

2.2.1.2 Compounds formed with POc _*tau-_ ‘person who…, person from…’

Compounding with _*tau-_ dates back at least to PMP times, as PMP _*tau-mataq_ shows.
Section 2.2.2 is dedicated to POc _*tamʷataq_ ‘living human being’, as it was probably no longer a
compound but a single lexeme. Oft reflected early Oceanic compounds with _*tau-_ include POc
_*tau-mate_ ‘dead person’ (§2.2.2.2), POc _*tau-paqoRu_ ‘young person of marriageable
age’ (§2.4.3), and PEOc _*tau-tasik_ ‘expert fisherman or sailor’ (vol.1:207 and below). The
terms for ‘man’ in Meso-Melanesian languages in the extreme north of New Ireland—Lavongai _tauan_
and Tiang _tauən_—are evidently cognate with Sinaugoro _tauɣani-_ ‘body’ and
reflect a PWOc compound _*tau-(q,k)ani_.

   Compounding with reflexes of POc _*tau-_ ‘person who…, person from…’, where the
second element is typically a verb or a placename, is still somewhat productive in a number of
modern languages, and we infer that it was productive in POc. Reflexes of the prefix are listed
first, then sample compounds from languages where it is in more frequent use.

    SE Solomonic languages do not figure among the examples below, but there is an
indication that at least the ‘person from…’ sense was once productive in SE Solomonic, as the
fossilised forms Sa’a _au-henue_ ‘be resident in a place, native of a place; inhabitant of a place’
and Arosi _au-henua_ ‘man of the place’ are found, both reflecting POc _*tau-panua_, where
_*panua_ meant roughly ‘inhabited place, community’ (vol.1:18, 62; vol.2:40, 295; Pawley 2005).

2.2.1.3 Pronominals formed with POc _*tau-_

POc _*tau-_ occurs as the root of pronominal forms only in Western Oceanic languages. Its
basic PWOc function was to form emphatic free pronouns corresponding to English pronouns
formed with -self in sentences like He did it himself. It apparently did not form reflexives.
However, in a few Papuan Tip languages (indicated below) emphatic forms reflecting _*tau-_
have lost their emphatic value and have displaced inherited free pronouns either throughout
the paradigm or, in Duau, in just the third person, or, in Bunama, in the first and third persons.

   Pronominals formed with POc _*tau-_ usually treat it as a directly possessed root (§3.1.1), as
in Yabem, Bunama and Dawawa below. Just two languages appear to use indirect possession
with the default alienable possession classifier, Sinaugoro _ɣe-_ and Babatana _na-_.

   The Bunama set is the ordinary free pronoun set. Note that Bunama retains inherited
second-person free pronouns, but replaces first- and third-person pronouns with the emphatics.

2.2.2 POc _*tamʷataq_ ‘living person’ and POc _*tau-mate_ ‘dead person’

POc _*tamʷataq_ reflects PMP _*tau-mataq_, literally ‘live person’, from _*tau_ ‘person’ (§2.2.1.1)
and _*mataq_ ‘raw, new, green’ (vol.1:155). It was thus the antonym of POc _*tau-mate_ ‘dead
person’ (_*mate_ ‘die, dead’, §4.2.1.2) and the two were among the many compounds with _*tau_
discussed in §2.2.1.2.

2.2.2.1 POc _*tamʷataq_ ‘living person’

It seems likely that POc _*tamʷataq_ had already become a synonym of monosyllabic _*tau_
(§2.2.1.1) in the sense ‘living person’. In several major subgroups – Admiralties, North New
Guinea, Fijian, Polynesian – reflexes of _*ta-mʷataq_ are the general term for a human being.

44 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


    There has been some debate about the form of this reconstruction. Almost all its reflexes
point to POc _*tamʷataq_ (or _*tamataq_, as the labial feature of _*mʷ_ has been unstable
throughout the history of Oceanic),[2] but scholars have pointed to Mussau _taumata_ as reflecting
POc _*tau-mataq_, the regular reflex of PMP _*tau-mataq_ ‘person’. Either both forms occurred
in POc dialects or, as Blust (1981a: 235) implies, the change from _*tau-mataq_ to _*tamʷataq_ had
not occurred by the time Mussau (one of two members of a putative small first-order subgroup
of Oceanic) separated from the rest of Oceanic. The discussion is in fact perhaps without
foundation. The change entailed the coarticulation of the rounding gesture of _*u_ in _*tau-mataq_
with the following _*m_, giving rise to _*mʷ_. No one suggests that the change was a regular one:
it isn’t reflected in known reflexes of _*tau-mate_. Rather, it was a lexically specific change in
an oft used word. According to the data available to us, the Mussau term for ‘person’ is
_taumatu_, not _taumata_, and _taumatu_ is not a reflex of POc †_*tau-mataq_, so the reconstruction
of the POc form _*tamʷataq_ is uncontested.

2.2.2.2 POc _*tau-mate_ ‘dead person’

POc _*tau-mate_ ‘corpse’, from _tau_ ‘person’ (§2.2.1.2) and _mate_ ‘die’ (§4.2.1.2) is reconstructed
on the basis of WOc and Micronesian reflexes. However, given the ubiquity of compounds
with _*tau_ (§2.2.1.2), it is possible that the term was innovated independently in each of the two
areas. The NCV terms are not fully cognate, as they appear to reflect _*qata_ rather than _*tau_ as
their first element (§2.2.3.2).

2.2.3 POc *qata ‘person’

There is another reconstruction, POc _*qata_, whose reflexes mean ‘human being’. Like _*tau_
(§2.2.1) it is reflected both as an independent noun and as the first part of a number of
compounds.

2.2.3.1 Unbound reflexes of POc _*qata_ ‘person’

In a 1972b note, repeated in the ACD, Blust reconstructs PMP _*qaRta_ with the meaning
‘outsiders, alien people’. He lists reflexes that include terms of self-designation from Negrito
people in Northern Luzon, terms meaning ‘slave’ in a geographically restricted area from the
southern Philippines to the Lesser Sundas, and a wide but discontinuous set of terms from
Sumatra to Maluku that simply denote ‘man, person’. He includes no Oceanic cognates. He
concludes that ‘outsiders, alien people’ is the prior PMP meaning with ‘person’ as a semantic
neutralisation in scattered areas.

   Putative reflexes of POc _*qata_ meaning ‘person’ occur in Vanuatu and New Caledonia. No
Oceanic reflexes carry the Malayo-Polynesian meaning ‘outsider’ except the possible New
Caledonian reflexes listed under ‘cf. also’, because they reflect *qataC rather than _*qata_. A
reasonable inference is that they reflect a compound consisting originally of _*qata_ and another
morpheme. If so, then their meaning does not necessarily attest to the meaning of POc _*qata_.

46 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   There are also apparent reflexes of POc _*qata_ which mean ‘soul, spirit’, but François
(2013) points out that in NCV languages these reflexes are inalienably possessed and have
remained separate from reflexes of _*qata_ ‘person’. The homophony is accidental. POc _*qata_
‘person’ reflects PMP _*qaRta_ ‘outsiders, alien people’, and POc _*qata(r)_ ‘image, reflection,
soul, spirit’ reflects PMP _*qatad_ ‘appearance, mark’ (§3.9.1).

   The North New Guinea reflexes of _*qata_ ‘person’ below function as an emphatic (‘he did it
himself’; cf. §2.2.1.3).

2.2.3.2 Compounds formed with POc _*qata-_ ‘person’

   A number of POc compounds had _*qata-_ ‘person’ as their first element. They differ from
those that had _*tau-_ as their first element. Whereas _*tau-_ is roughly translated ‘person who
…’ (§2.2.1.2), compounds with _*qata-_ simply denote a person (as _*tamʷataq_ ‘living person’
does; §2.2.2.1) and gender- and age-based categories of human beings. In this section those
compounds that denote people in general are presented. Compounds denoting gender-based
categories are POc _*qata-mʷaqane_ ‘man, male’ (§2.3.1) and POc _*qata-pine_ ‘woman,
female’ (§2.3.2). Those denoting age-based categories—they are not widely reflected—are
Proto SE Solomonic _*qata-natu_ ‘child’ and Proto North–Central Vanuatu _*ta-maraɣai_ ‘old
man’ (§2.4.6). The sense of POc _*qata-mate_ ‘malevolent spirit of a dead person’ suggests that
it almost certainly reflects POc _*qata(r)_ ‘image, reflection, soul, spirit’, not POc _*qata_
‘person’.

                                                                                       People 47

    François (2013) points out that where a term for a category or people begins with _*ta-_, this
is potentially ambiguous between an origin in _*qata-_ and one in _*tau-_. However, as just noted,
there seems to be a systematic difference in meaning between _*tau-_ and _*qata-_. There is also a
phonological difference, as _*tau-_ is usually reflected as _tau-_ or _to-_, and the diphthong _*-au-_ is
reflected even in Micronesian languages where there has been substantial phonological
change. Prefixed _*qata-_, on the other hand, is reflected as _ta-_ when it loses its first syllable, as
it often does.

    Most of the following are restricted to a local group of languages. Only Proto Remote Oceanic
_*[qa]ta-maquri_ ‘living person’ (_*maqurip_ ‘be alive’; §4.2.1.1) spans a large piece of Oceania, but it
has few reflexes and may reflect parallel innovations.

2.2.4 POc _*tinoni_ ‘person, people’

    Reflexes of POc _*tinoni_ are limited to two subgroups. Apart from Vitu off the north coast
of New Britain, all languages listed here are from the Northwest Solomons or the Southeast
Solomons where the term apparently has now become the general term for a human being. Its
limited range makes it difficult to establish its POc meaning.

    As with English ‘man’, reflexes of both _*ta-mʷataq_ and _*tinoni_ may sometimes be used as
a term for people in general and sometimes for males only.

2.2.5 POc _*(k,kʷ)a(i)_ ‘person’

The reconstruction of POc _*(k,kʷ)a(i)_ ‘person’ is somewhat speculative. This morpheme appears
to have meant ‘a person belonging to a certain group’, and was followed by a modifier
indicating the identity of that group. It is reflected in this function or something close to it in
the Iduna, To’aba’ita, Arosi, Nguna, Bauan and Wayan Fijian terms and perhaps in the plural
form PPn _*ka-kai_. The reconstruction is speculative in two respects. First, in Western Oceanic
languages in particular, there are numerous forms beginning with _ka-_ which denote a category
of person, and we have taken these to be reflexes of _*ka_. Some of them may well have other
origins. Where possible the modifier that follows the reflex of _*ka-_ is identified. Second, the
form of the reconstruction is uncertain. POc _*kʷa-_ is reflected as far east as Bugotu (with
exceptions in Medebur and Bola), switching to _*kʷai-_ from Malaita and Makira eastward.[4]
Reconstruction of initial _*kʷ-_, rather than _*k-_, is also uncertain. POc _*kʷ_ was an unstable
phoneme that is reflected as _kʷ_ only in Papuan Tip languages and Western Fijian (Ross 2011).
In these and some other languages *kʷa sometimes becomes _*ko_. Among the reflexes
below, Iduna _kʷa-na_ and Wayan _koi_ are thus consistent with the reconstruction of POc _kʷa(i)_.
Indeed, we have no other explanation for them (other than the possibility that the set below
includes some non-cognate forms). Proto Malaita-Makira, however, normally reflects POc
_*kʷ-_ as _*k-_, but the forms below instead reflect _*ɣ-_, casting doubt on the reconstruction of POc
_*kʷ-_.

[3] PEMP _*tinoni_ is reconstructed on the basis of the Oceanic reflexes here and two West New Guinea reflexes,
    Biak _snon_ 'man', Dusner _snon_ 'male'.

[4] We have asked ourselves whether _*kʷai-_ reflects _*kʷa qi_, where _*qi_ is the marker of nonspecific
    possession that follows a directly possessed noun. This would mean that _*kʷa_ was directly possessed, as
    it appears to be in Iduna. But the expected form would then be _*kʷaqi_, not _*kʷai_.

2.3     People by gender

2.3.1 Man, male

Two POc terms are reconstructable reflecting PMP _*ma-Ruqanay_ ‘male, man’. They perhaps
occurred in different POc dialects, as no language reflects both. The expected form, POc
_*maRuqane_, is reflected in just a few languages, in the Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian
linkages of Western Oceanic. Much more widespread is POc _*mʷaqane_, a curiously truncated
variant of _*maRuqane_.

    Blust (1982b) comments that the origin of the truncated form is problematic. Lynch (2002e)
suggests two possible origins. Both assume that _*-R-_ had been irregularly lost (it is
sporadically lost in non-Oceanic languages too, perhaps because tetrasyllabic roots were
dispreferred). The first hypothesis says that the _*m-_ of _*maRuqane_ became _*mʷ-_ under the
influence of _*-u-_. For this to be true, _*-u-_ must have been adjacent to _*m-_, as the two fused as
_*mʷ-_ (cf. the discussion of the history of _*tamʷata_ in §2.2.2.1). Lynch suggests that
_*maRuqane_ metathesised to †_*muRaqane_, This would have been followed by loss of _*-R-_,
giving †_*muaqane_, leading to _*mʷaqane_.

    Lynch also offers an alternative explanation whereby _*maRuqane_ formed a compound
_*tau-maRuqane_, giving rise to _*tamʷaRuqane_ (cf. §2.2.2.1), which was then reanalysed,
leaving _mʷaRuqane_ as a separate morpheme with initial _*mʷ-_. Of the two explanations, the
first is more explanatory, as the second fails to explain loss of _*-u-_. There is in any case
evidence that forms that might be taken to reflect _*tau-maRuqane_ actually reflect
_*qata-mʷaqane_.

                                                                                         People 51

   The few forms that reflect _*maRuqane_ all mean ‘male, man’. There is good evidence that
POc _*mʷaqane_ had two uses. As an independent noun, it meant ‘male, man’, but as a directly
possessed noun (§3.1.1) it meant ‘brother of a woman’. It appears with this sense in the
Admiralties and across Remote Oceanic, establishing its POc origin.

    The following POc reconstruction is a compound of _*qata_ ‘person’ and POc _*mʷaqane_
‘man, male’ (cf. §2.2.3.2), based on numerous reflexes, many of which show reduction of
form in various ways, commonly by deleting _*qa-_. Polynesian languages have deleted _*-mʷa-_.
Only two widely separated reflexes, Nakanai (MM) and Anejom (SV) share the meaning
‘brother of woman’, but, given that POc _*mʷaqane_ had this sense, it is reasonable to attribute
it also to POc _*qata-mʷaqane_.

2.3.2 Woman

The terms for ‘woman, female’ present one of the most challenging reconstructive tasks in
Austronesian historical linguistics, with a number of terms derived from PAn _*bahi_ ‘woman,
female’. (Blust 1982b, ACD).[6] Although POc reflects only two of the many variants reflected in
non-Oceanic languages, namely _*pine_ and _*papine_, it has generated variants of its own. With
some exceptions, most in Vanuatu, _*pine_ occurs only in the compounds presented below.

54 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   In Bugotu and Gela (both SES) the regular reflex of _*papine_ means ‘opposite-sex sibling’,
and across SE Solomonic the term for ‘woman’ reflects POc _*paipine_, a variant that remains
unexplained. In a number of Papuan Tip reflexes of _*papine_ and _*paipine_ initial _*p-_ is
replaced by _*w-_, again an unexplained change.

   Corresponding to _*qata-mʷaqane_ ‘man’ (§2.3.1) is POc _*qata-pine_, a compound of _*qata_
‘person’ and POc _*pine_ ‘woman, female’ (cf. §2.2.3.2). No five-syllable reflexes of POc
†_*qata-papine_ ‘woman, female’ have been found. Like other compounds in _*qata-_, the first

2.4       People by age cohort

2.4.1 Oceanic age cohort terms

There is a framework of single-word terms for age cohorts that seems to have a similar
structure in many Oceanic languages. The basic elements are:

__block__
 1.    young person, the age range of which often stretches from birth to adulthood
 2.    person of marriageable age, typically two terms, female and male
 3.    fully grown adult
 4.    mature middle-aged adult, typically two terms, female and male
 5.    very old person

It is sometimes difficult to align terms from different languages, first because in most dictionaries
age cohort terms appear to be incompletely listed, and secondly because dictionaries typically give
only relative ages,[7] and definitions like ‘young girl’ are vague. However, the five basic terms in
an eight-language sample are laid out in Table 13.[8]

    Several observations are in order. The empty cells in Table 13 marked with ‘…’ might be
filled if the data were more complete, but the empty cells marked with ‘—’ are probably
artefacts of our representation of gender-related terms. For example, Mutu has _kōŋ_ ‘mature
person’, but apparently no dedicated terms for ‘mature man’ or ’mature woman’. To’aba’ita
has gender-specific terms for (marriageable) young adults, but apparently no genderless term
for ‘young adult’. Numbami and Mwotlap stand out from the other languages in the table in
that they have a larger number of gender-specific terms. These are shown with a slash, thus
feminine/masculine. Several To’aba’ita terms are basically verbs. Thus darā means ‘be a
marriageable young man’.

    Terms for ‘young person’, labelled ‘1’ in Table 13, typically embrace an age range from
birth to the onset of adulthood which is divided into smaller categories by either using the
‘young person’ term with modifiers (Khehek, Numbami, Nehan and Wayan) or using further
single-word terms. These are shown in Table 14. The exception here is Mwotlap, where the
‘young person’ term does not include children below about six years of age and as a result
fewer terms are formed with modifiers.

    The basic divisions in Table 14 are (1a) baby, (1b) prepubescent child and (1c) adolescent.
This tabulation is not exhaustive. Wayan also has the terms _driadria tabatūtū_ ‘infant learning
to stand’ and _driadria kakarebareba_ ‘toddler’. To’aba’ita has _wela kōkosa_ or _wela ʔāʔabu_
‘newborn baby’, _wela kā_ ‘baby that can crawl’ and _wela ʔāʔaru_ ‘toddler’. Paamese has titali
‘infant sitting up’. Mutu apparently singles out children aged around four or five as
_kukua_. Since the ‘young girl/young boy’ terms in Mwotlap designate young people from
around six years of age upward, a separate term _nɪ-nɪtmʷəy_ denotes children under six.
Mwotlap also has a term _n-ɛt su_ [ART-person little] ‘children’ contrasting with _n-ɛt liwɔ_
[ART-person big] ‘adults’.

[7] Exceptions are François (2012) and Pawley & Sayaba (2003).

[8]  Thanks go to Alexandre François, who provided us with terms in Mwotlap and other Torres/Banks languages.

    With one exception, there is little cognacy across the eight languages in the tables above,
yet the categories appear similar, and it is a reasonable inference that POc had such categories.
The exception is that ‘fully grown adult’ is often designated by the term that means ‘person’.
The POc term denoting a fully grown adult was thus probably _*tamʷata_ ‘person’ (§2.2.2.1),
reflected above in Numbami, Nehan and Wayan. We also hypothesise that where POc age
cohort terms distinguished gender, they did so using *papine ‘female’ (§2.3.2) and _*mʷaqane_
‘male’ (§2.3.1) as modifiers. The evidence for this is somewhat circumstantial, but see
To’aba’ita _ila wane_ ‘married man’, _wēwelani-wane_ ‘young boy’, Paamese _ahin_ ‘adult woman’,
and Wayan _driadria taŋʷane_ ‘young boy’.

    The lack of cognacy among age cohort terms partly reflects shifts in meaning over time.
Thus Khehek (Adm) _kxikxiŋ_ ‘fully grown adult’ and Wayan (Fij) _driadria_ ‘young person’
appear to be cognate.

    Below, reconstructions for age cohorts are discussed under the headings used in Tables 13
and 14. Reconstruction in this semantic domain is not easy, as a wealth of local terms for age
cohorts are found but few terms that have survived across a number of Oceanic primary
subgroups


2.4.2 Young person from birth to onset of adulthood

The English word ‘child’ has two meanings: (1) offspring and (2) young boy or girl. Thus (1)
denotes a kin relationship, (2) an age group. The POc term for sense (1), ‘offspring’, is _*natu-_, a
kin term (see vol.6).

   Oceanic languages typically have no single-word term corresponding to English ‘childʼ in
sense (2) but instead have a term for human beings from birth to the onset of adulthood. POc
*meRa appears to have been the term denoting this age group. A number of its reflexes are
glossed simply ‘child’, but we suspect that this is a product of wordlist collecting, where the
informant is simply asked for the term corresponding to English ‘child’. Evidence that POc
_*meRa_ did mean ‘person from birth to adulthood’ is found in the To’aba’ita and ’Are’are
dictionary entries below and in the generalisation of some of its NCV reflexes to mean
something like English ‘fellow, guy’, i.e. a colloquial way of referring to men in particular.

   The origin of POc _*meRa_ was pointed out to us by Charles Grimes (pers. comm.). In a
number of CMP languages the term for a newborn is ‘red child’, and in some of these the term
‘red’ reflects PMP _*ma-iRaq_ ‘red’ (ACD). In PCEMP and POc this became _*meRaq_
‘red’ (vol.2:206; ACD). The terms below are drawn from a geographically well distributed
range of CMP languages.[9] The association between ‘red’ and ‘newborn’ seems to have been
lost in early Oceanic, but POc _*meRa_ seems to have had the specific meaning ‘newborn’ (see
Misima and Arosi glosses) and the metonomic usage ‘young person from birth to onset of
adulthood’.

[10] Given that Fox (1978) also glosses reduplicated _mʷera mʷera_ as ‘very small child’, we wonder whether
     his gloss of _mʷera_ is erroneous.

62 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond

   It is possible that the apparent PNCV doublet _*mʷara_ above is the product of reflexes of
_*mʷera_ that have undergone contamination by reflexes of POc _*mʷala_ ‘young unmarried
woman’ (§2.4.3).

   A few languages have distinct single-word terms for ‘boy’ and ‘girl’, but they are few and
far between. POc seems simply to have used the terms for ‘male’ (§2.3.1) and
‘female’ (§2.3.2) alone or as modifiers to a ‘young person’ term, as in ’Are’are (SES)
_mera māne_ ‘boy’ and _mera keni_ ‘girl’.


2.4.2.1 Baby, infant, newborn

POc apparently had two terms for ‘baby’, _*meRa-meRa_ and _*kʷawaq_. No language has been
found in which they contrast. The use of reduplication in POc for a diminutive or a small
version of the denotatum of the root was noted in vol.3:50–51. POc _*meRa-meRa_ thus meant
‘baby, very young child’, a small version of _*mʷeRa_ ‘young person from birth to onset of
adulthood’ (§2.4.2). Polynesian reflexes are often modifiers of a reflex of PPn _*tama_ ‘child’.[11]

[11] PPn _*tama_ ‘child’ is derived from POc _*tama-_ ‘father’, enshrining a development whereby _*tama_ came
     to denote the reciprocal relationship between father and child. Note Gela _tama_ ‘prefix of reciprocal
     relation’, e.g. _tama-dale_ ‘father and children’, _tama-kukua_ ‘a man and his grandparents’, _tama-vavineni_
     ‘sister and brother’; Bauan _vei-tama-ni_ (V) ‘be related as father and child’, (N) ‘father and child’.

    POc _*kʷawaq_ seems also to have meant ‘baby, small child’. Initial _*kʷa-_ is reconstructed to
account for Dawawa and Misima _wa-_. In several languages the _*-a-_ of the first syllable is
reflected as a rounded vowel. This can be attributed either to _*kʷa-_ or to the _*-w-_ that follows
it.

2.4.2.2 Child

No term is reconstructable for ‘child’, i.e., a person up to the onset of puberty, although many
languages have one-word terms. However, a theme that runs through certain Oceanic
subgroups is that the term for ‘child’ consists of what is or once was a term for ‘person’
modified by a term for ‘little’ or it consists just of the term for ‘little’ alone. Forms for ‘little’
were reconstructed in vol.2:193–195:

•    POc _*kiki_ ‘small’
•    POc _*rikit_
•    PWOc _*siki_ ‘small’

    POc _*liki_ ‘small’ occurs perhaps only in compounds, and is present in the items listed
below. The Madak, Sursurunga and Bilur forms apparently reflect PWOc _*kʷa[i]_ (§2.2.5) as
their first element, whilst the first element in Patpatar and Proto Polynesian reflects POc
_*tama-_ ‘father’, where the child is construed as the small member in the father–child
relationship.

2.4.3 Young (unmarried) person

Although Table 14 shows category (1c) ‘adolescent, not yet marriageable’, there is no evidence
that POc speakers treated this as a category separate from ‘young unmarried person’. The lower
bound of this category was puberty, the upper bound marriage. Note that in Wayan Fijian, for
example, the term for (1c) is compound, _dridria saravou_ i.e. ‘young person’ + ‘marriageable
young man’, i.e. (1c) represents an overlap between ‘young person’ and ‘marriageable young
man’, post-puberty but not quite old enough for marriage.

   The most widely reflected expression for a young (unmarried) person consists of a word
for ‘person’ (perhaps POc _*tau_; §2.2.1.1), sometimes omitted, and a reflex of POc _*paqoRu_
‘new, young, recent’). The ‘young, unmarried’ sense was already present in PAn _*baqeRuh_
(ACD).

A second term for an unmarried young person, apparently a young woman, is POc _*mʷala_. The
gloss is based on the agreement of the North New Guinea and North–Central Vanuatu glosses
below. PNCV _*mʷala-gelo_ also has a modifier of unknown meaning as its second element, and
Clark (2009) concludes that _*mʷala-gelo_ probably denoted a young male. The glosses of his
supporting data (below) would equally well support the gloss ‘young adult’, however.

2.4.4 Fully grown adult

   As mentioned in §2.4.1 the POc term denoting a full-grown adult was probably _*tamʷata_
‘person’ (§2.2.2.1).

   Wayan Fijian, at least, distinguishes life-stage terms from marriage-related terms (Andrew
Pawley, pers. comm.). It is uncertain whether this is true of many Oceanic languages, but the
weight of the evidence points in that direction, as languages tend not to have a lifestage (as
opposed to kin) term denoting ‘married man’ or ‘married woman’. As most adult men and
women in Oceanic communities are married, they are referred to by the unmarked terms for
‘man’ or ‘woman’. These are typically reflexes of *mwaqane/*qatamwaqane (§2.3.1) and
_*papine_/_*qatapine_ (§2.3.2).


2.4.5 Mature person

Most Oceanic languages seem to distinguish at least two stages of mature adulthood, one for
people of perhaps 30–50, i.e. vigorous adults with unmarried children, and another for people
older than perhaps 50 or 60 and no longer so vigorous.[12] Vigour is probably more important
than age here. In Wayan Fijian a still active 60-year-old is _uabula_, i.e. ‘mature’ rather than ‘old’.
A difficulty in the data is that ‘old’ tends to be used indiscriminately in definitions of both
categories. Sometimes one category is labelled ‘old’, the other ‘very old’. Sometimes ‘mature’
is used, and this is taken to be an indicator of the younger category.

    The most widespread cognate set for a ‘mature person’ reflects POc _*matuqa_ ‘mature, full-grown,
ripe, old (person)’. Only reflexes that denote a person are listed here. POc _*matuqa_
was evidently originally a stative verb, and in some languages it occurs as modifier of (the
reflex of) a term meaning ‘person’. In the Huon Gulf languages of Western Oceanic, it has
become the usual term for ‘man’.

[12] Since Oceanic traditional societies did not count birthdays, these figures are of necessity
very approximate. Furthermore, modern increases in life expectancy have almost certainly changed
the age ranges which these terms denote.

2.4.6 Old person

For ‘old person’ POc _*mʷarap_ (V) ‘grow old’, (N) ‘old person’ and _*tobʷan_ ‘old person’ are
tentatively reconstructed.

    On evidence from Papuan Tip languages POc _*mʷarap_ was originally a verb. It retains a
verbal use in Gapapaiwa. In Muyuw, Kilivila and Budibud it is prefixed with a classifier,
_ta-_/_to-_ for human males (< POc _*tau-_ ‘person who…; §2.2.1.2) or _na-_ for human females
(Lawton 1993:184–185). Prefixal classifiers are generally affixed to modifiers in noun phrases
in this group of languages, indicating that the root is a verb ‘be(come) old’.

                                                                                 People 69


   Final _*-p_ of _*mʷarap_ is regularly reflected in Gapapaiwa and is perhaps also responsible
for the rounding of the final vowel in SE Solomonic languages.

   The NCV items are listed under ‘cf. also’ because it is uncertain whether they are cognate.
François (2013) takes them to reflect _*maraɣai_ ‘to tremble’ with prefixed _*ta-_ (< _*qata_
‘person’). If his etymology is correct, then the resemblance of the PNCV reconstruction to the
POc reconstruction must be attributed to chance.

2.5      People by absence of relationship

Kinship relationships will be discussed in vol.6. The terms below denote a person who lacks a
particular relationship. English has such terms: ‘orphan’, ‘widow[er]’, ‘spinster’, ‘bachelor’.
Oceanic languages have terms with these meanings and more. For example, in Mutu (NNG)
we find _kakam_ ‘woman whose child has died’, _māⁿduat_ ‘man whose child has died’, _kulīŋ_ ‘man
whose sibling has died’ and _silūn_ ‘woman whose sibling has died’.

2.5.1 Orphan

Despite the glosses of the data below, we take POc _*mad(r)awa_ to be a stative (adjectival) verb,
as suggested by the prefix _*ma-_ (§1.3.5.4). The 3SG agreement marker of Arop-Lukep
_madu(nu)_ also suggests that it is an adjective rather than a noun.

2.5.2 Unmarried person

POc _*jamu_ ‘person without spouse’ evidently denoted spinsters, bachelors, widows and
widowers. Regular reflexes are confined to SES and one MM language. Manam _amuna_
appears to be a cognate, but is missing a reflex of initial _*j-_.

2.5.3 Widow, widower

Blust (ACD) reconstructs two distinct but similar forms for POc, labelling them both
‘widow(er)’. Either they were alternant forms of the same lexeme, or they contrasted with
regard to the sex of the denotatum. The one piece of evidence that helps us out here is the
contrast between Sori _ñaw_ ‘widow’ and _ñah_ ‘widower’. If this contrast is a retention, then we
can gloss the reconstructions accordingly. However, Blust is rightly cautious, as pairs that
distinguish gender by a change in the wordform are otherwise unheard of in Oceanic
languages.

    Also reconstructable is PWOc _*kʷabu(r,R)_ ‘widow or widower’. One wonders how it
differed in meaning from the term above. Fox (1978) gives us a possible clue. After the death
of one’s spouse, in Arosi one is nao. Only after a lengthy fast from certain foods does one
become eligible for remarriage and acquire a new status, Arosi _oʔoura_ (which does not reflect
_*kʷabu(r,R)_, however).

2.6     Twins

Three POc terms for ‘twins’ are reconstructed. The first is POc _*bʷege_ or _*boge_. The form is
ambiguous, as it takes only a simple sound change to get from one to the other. A second term
was based on the POc root _*saŋa_ ‘be branching or forked; branch (of tree, river, path), fork,
crotch)’ (vol.3:96). It occurs in two variants: (a) a reduplicated form, probably _*saŋa-saŋa_, and
a stative verb form derived with _*ka-_/_*ma-_ (variants of the same prefix: see §1.3.5.4). These
terms can be used to identify various objects that carry the meaning ‘two parts of one whole’.
Thus they may refer to a double nut or double banana as well as twins. Also reconstructed is
POc _*apic_ ‘twins of the same sex’.

3                The human body

3.1 Introduction

Body part terms such as those for head, eye, nose, arm, leg, and breast, are among the most
stable of all lexemes.[1] For this reason they are included by linguists in the ‘basic vocabulary’
used, for example, to measure relationships among languages lexicostatistically.

    In Oceanic languages, as in languages worldwide, body part terms are used metaphorically,
for instance in landscape features, where nose sometimes means cape, mouth means hole or
entrance, and belly means central part. It is probably also universal that body part terms are
used to refer to location in space, to top, middle, bottom, front, back, left and right. In Oceanic
languages internal organs, particularly the liver, are used in expressions of emotion and other
mental states where, for instance, ‘to be startled’ is expressed as ‘one’s liver leaps’ or similar.

    Glossing reconstructions has sometimes been tricky. There are two interacting reasons for
this. One is that some POc terms appear—on the basis of their reflexes—to have had a
different denotation from English terms for a similar area of the body. For example, POc
*qase- evidently denoted both the lower jaw (the hinged bone and its covering of skin) and the
chin (the external shape of the lowest and frontmost part of the lower jaw) (§3.4.13).
Interacting with this is the fact that the English glosses of Oceanic terms are often imprecise,
or give a false appearance of precision as when a reflex of _*qase-_ is glossed ‘chin’. This is
especially true of words found in wordlists, but it is also true of several of the dictionaries
used. Sometimes it is solely the English glosses that are at fault. This is the case with the four
POc terms for the region of the neck, the throat and the voice, where glosses remain a little
vague because of imprecision in the English glosses in the cognate sets (§3.4.14).

    Contents are organised into the body (§3.2), materials that occur throughout the body
(blood, flesh etc) (§3.3), then the parts of the body: the head (§3.4), the trunk (§3.5), the limbs
(§3.6), the internal organs (§3.7), substances eliminated by the body (§3.8) and two
incorporeal parts, shadow/reflection and name (§3.9), which are treated grammatically in
many Oceanic languages as if they were body parts (they are directly possessed).

3.1.1 Direct possession


[1] We are grateful to Paul Geraghty who has commented on an earlier version of this chapter and made a
    number of additions to the data.

76 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross

Most Oceanic languages outside Polynesia make a grammatical distinction between directly
and indirectly possessed nouns, and this distinction is reconstructable for Proto Oceanic
(Lichtenberk 1985a). As discussed briefly in vol.1:32, a directly possessed (= monovalent) noun
takes a suffix indicating its possessor (e.g. POc _*qaqe-_ ‘leg’: _*qaqe-gu_ ‘my leg’, _*qaqe-mu_
‘your (singular) leg’, _*qaqe-ña_ ‘his/her leg’ etc), whereas an indirectly possessed
(zero-valency) noun requires no suffix. Directly possessed nouns are said to be inalienably
possessed, that is, they are items that usually do not exist without a possessor. They include
body parts of human beings and animals (‘hand’, ‘nose’, ‘tail’, ‘wing/fin’ etc), parts of plants
(‘fruit’, ‘bark’, ‘branch’ etc), relational local nouns (§3.1.2), and kin terms (‘father’, ‘same-sex
sibling’ etc).[2] However, the converse is not true: not all kin and body part terms are directly
possessed. In many Oceanic languages, a monovalent noun must have a possessor suffix or, if
the possessor is nonspecific, be linked in some way to that possessor. This linkage may reflect
the POc linker _*qi_ (e.g. POc _*pasu qi mata-_ ‘ridge of eye’ = ‘eyebrow ridge’; §3.4.9.3), but in
many languages the linker is lost and a compound occurs (e.g. Nguna _vasu-mata_ ‘eyebrow’). In
other languages _*qi_ has been replaced by a reflex of _*ni_, which occurred with a zero-valency
possessor noun. It is not clear whether the possessor suffix or the linker was obligatory in Proto
Oceanic (Ross 1998c reconstructs the construction with _*qi_).

    Directly possessed nouns are here marked with a following hyphen, e.g. _*qaqe-_ ‘leg’, in
order to indicate that a possessor suffix was/is usually present.


3.1.2 Relational local nouns

Above it was mentioned that across languages body part terms are often used to refer to spatial
locations. Some body part terms have undergone varying degrees of grammaticisation in
Oceanic languages, a process that had started in Proto Oceanic. Certain terms were used not
only to denote a body part but also as local nouns that denoted a spatial relationship to a person
or object. Local nouns were a grammatical category in Proto Oceanic (and remain so in many
Oceanic languages). They were introduced by the POc preposition _*i_. For example, _*Rumaq_
‘house’ also functioned as a local noun, and _*i Rumaq_ meant ‘at home’ (on the grammar of
local nouns see vol.2:224–229).

    Relational local nouns were directly possessed and their possessor was the person or object
in relation to which a location was being established. Thus POc _*mata-_ ‘eye, face’ also served
as a relational local noun meaning ‘front’, so that _*i mata-gu_ (_*-gu_ ‘my’) meant ‘in front of
me’ and _*i mata-ña_ Rumaq meant ‘in front of the house’ (_*-ña_ ‘his/her/its’). The grammar of
relational local nouns is discussed in more detail in vol.2:235–236. Lexical items that served
as relational local nouns, many but not all of which also denoted body parts, are reconstructed
in vol.2:237–257.

    Body part nouns which almost certainly also functioned as relational local nouns were POc
_*qulu-_ ‘head, head hair’, (N LOC) ‘top part’ (§3.4.1), _*nako-_ ‘face’, (N (LOC)) ‘front’ (§3.4.7),
_*[pʷa]pʷaRa-_ ‘cheek, side of head’, (N LOC) ‘side’ (§3.4.8), _*mata-_ ‘eye, face’, (N LOC)
‘front’ (§3.4.9.1), _*bʷal(o,a)-_ ‘belly, hollow space’, (N LOC) ‘inside’ (§3.7.4).

    Occasionally the reverse process seems to have taken place, so that a relational local noun
has extended its meaning to denote a body part. Thus a reflex of POc _*siriŋ_ ‘side’ (vol.2:246)
also denotes ‘rib cage’ in Dami (NNG) (§3.5.6). POc _*qaro-_ seems primarily to have been a
relational local noun meaning ‘front’ (vol.2:247) but some of its reflexes now also denote the
face of a person (§3.4.7). Similarly POc _*muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of,
time after; (canoe) stern; space outside’ (vol.2:251) was clearly a relational local noun, some
reflexes of which now denote a person’s back (§3.5.1). Whether _*takuRu-_ ‘back’, (N LOC)
‘back’ (§3.5.1 and vol.2:253) was originally a local noun or denoted a body part is difficult to
determine.

[2] Terms for parts of animals are reconstructed in volume 4 (ch.2, §66; ch.5, §7; ch.6, §2); terms for parts
    of plants in chapter 5 of volume 3; and relational local nouns in volume 2 (ch.8, §2.3).

                                                                                The human body 77


3.2     The body

Modern Oceanic languages typically have separate monomorphemic lexical items with the
following semantic ranges:

__block__
1) the whole body, seen as the complete skin and its contents, and also used of the skin as a
   whole (§3.2.1);
2) the trunk or torso—the body without the head and with or without the legs; the main part
   of something, e.g. the hull of a canoe (§3.2.2);
3) a dead body, corpse (§2.2.2.2).

Meaning 1 also contrasts on a whole/part parameter with meaning 4:

__block__
4) the skin of a human being or animal, as well as the bark of a tree, the rind of a fruit or the
   peeled skin of a fruit or tuber, i.e. a surface covering that can be lifted off piecemeal
   (§3.3.5);

And on an exterior/interior parameter with meaning 5:

__block__
5) (in some languages) the interior of the body, the inner spiritual part of the person (§9.2.2).

   Below are examples of terms for the five listed categories.

__table__
                   | (1)        |      (2)     |   (3)          |        (4)     |        (5)
                   | ‘exterior, body, skin’ | ‘trunk’ | ‘corpse’ | ‘skin, bark, rind’  | ‘interior, spiritual part’
  Mutu (NNG)       | _tini-_      | _anoŋa-_   |  _pata-_       |  _uli-_        |     _lolo-_
  Dobu (PT)        | _oo-_        | _tolobʷa-_ |  _kokowa-_     |  _bʷala-_      |     _nua-_
  Nakanai (MM)     | _vovo-_      | _kabili-_  |  _vata-_       |  _kuli-kuli-_  |     _ilo-_
  To’aba’ita (SES) | _seʔe-_      | _ʔinafu-_  |  …             |  _ʔuŋa_        |     —
  Mota (NCV)       | _(tarapei)_  | _turiai_   |  _tamate_      |  _vinitiu_     |     _lolo-_, _ape-_
  Wayan (Fij)      | _-taba-taba_ | _-aŋo_     |  _aŋo ni mate_ |  _-taba_       |     _aloŋa_

Mota _tarapei_ is parenthesised because it is not clear that its definition (‘body, shape,
appearance’) is close to meaning 1. To’aba’ita has a gap under ‘corpse’, as Lichtenberk (2008)
lists only terms for the corpse wrapped in a mat ready for burial. Wayan Fijian is slightly
exceptional, in that it clearly retains the four semantic categories but apparently renders ‘corpse’
phrasally, and uses the same morpheme _-taba_ in both ‘skin’ terms, distinguishing them by
reduplication.

    To’aba’ita has a gap under meaning 5, ‘interior, spiritual part’. Terms with this meaning are
often reflexes of POc _*lalo-_ ‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’ or its short variant POc
_*lo-_ ‘inside’ (vol.2:237–238, §9.2.2). To’aba’ita has a reflex of this term, namely _lalo-_, but it
is limited to spatial uses. The reflex of _*lalo-_/_lo-_ with meaning 5 is used in a number of
languages in body-part expressions that label emotional and cognitive states, but in some
languages it is replaced partly or entirely by other body-part terms, and this is true of
To’aba’ita. Meaning 5 is further discussed in ch.9, where _*lalo-_ is reconstructed.

78 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


   Terms for these categories presumably also occurred in POc, but POc terms for meanings 1
and 2 have proven somewhat elusive.

   The story with regard to meanings 1, 2 and 5 appears to be one of reassignment of forms
from one meaning to another, especially in PEOc, where (i) _*popo-_, _*tini-_ and _*pata-_ no
longer appeared in these meanings; (ii) _*tubuq-a(ŋ)_ reflexes shifted from meaning 2 to ‘spirit
being’; and (iii) _*[q]abe-_ took over meaning 2. Further discussion is provided in the relevant
sections below.

3.2.1 The ‘complete skin’, metonymically the body

Two PWOc terms are reconstructable for meaning 1, the whole body, viewed as the complete
skin, often with its contents. The glosses of their reflexes do not allow a semantic distinction
between PWOc _*popo-_ and _*tini-_. The latter is better distributed, but Eastern Oceanic cognates
have been found for neither, and a POc term is not reconstructable.

   Discussing what is clearly the same concept in Lelek, a dialect of Madak of New Ireland,
Richard Eves (1998:26) writes,

__blockquote__
     As in some parts of Melanesia, where there is no generic term for the body as such, when
     the Lelek speak of the body they speak of the skin, _labantuxu_. ... This is not to say that
     there is no conceptualisation of the body but merely that the skin comes to stand for the body
     as a whole.

The formal relationship, if any, between PWOc _*tini-_ above and PPn _*tino_ ‘body, trunk of tree,
hull of canoe’ below (approximating to sense 2) is unclear, and the resemblance may be due to
chance. The same is true of the relationship between PPn _*tino_ and POc _*tinoni_ ‘man,
person’ (§2.2.4).

3.2.2 The trunk

It is not clear prima facie whether terms with meaning 2, ‘trunk’, originally meant ‘the main
part of something’, so that the main part of a human being was perceived to be the trunk, or
whether they originally denoted the human trunk and were applied analogously to other objects
like the trunk of a tree or the main part of a canoe or the tubers of a yam plant. However, the
two terms reconstructed below imply the former.

    POc _*pata-_, _*pataŋ_ ‘trunk of human body; tree trunk’ is more widely reflected as ‘tree
trunk’ than ‘human trunk’ (vol.3:89), implying that an extension of meaning to include the
human torso may have occurred independently in the Admiralties and Micronesia.

>

   POc _*tubuq-a(ŋ)_ reflects a nominalisation of the POc verb _*tubuq_ ‘grow, thrive,
swell’ (vol.1:134), an origin that implies a wider original sense closer to the Iduna gloss ‘body,
growth, fullness’ than simply to ‘body’. Indeed, it may be that POc _*pata-_, _*pataŋ_ above and
POc _*tubuq-a(ŋ)_ differed subtly in meaning. Getting at the meaning of _*tubuq-a(ŋ)_ is difficult,
partly because of inadequate glosses in sources, and partly because in PEOc the meaning had
shifted to ‘spirit being’, where meaning 2 was perhaps assumed by PEOc _*[q]abe-_ below.
This in its turn had shifted in PNCV to meaning 5, the inner spiritual part of a person.

3.3     Bodily materials

This section contains terms for the ‘materials’ or ‘substances’ which speakers perceive as
making up the human body: flesh (§3.3.1), fat (§3.3.2), blood (§3.3.3), bones (§3.3.4), skin
(§3.3.5), hair (§3.3.7–8) and all the cord-like bits (veins, arteries, sinews and tendons, §3.3.9)
that appear when an animal is being cut up. Treated separately under §3.8 are substances
emitted by the body.

3.3.1 Flesh

POc _*pisiko_ denoted human and animal flesh and muscle, as well as cooked meat.

3.3.2 Fat

POc _*jiji_ ‘meat, fat, grease’ is reconstructed. The frequent mentions of ‘meat’ in the data below
may be read as references to the edible parts of an animal.

    Another term applied to ‘fat, grease’ is POc _*moñak_ ‘fat, oil, cream, coconut cream;
tasty’ (vol.3:372).

3.3.3 Blood

The POc term for blood was _*draRa(q)_. Reflexes are found in all major subgroups except SE
Solomonic and Polynesian. In a number of languages the term for ‘red’ is based on the term for
‘blood’ (vol.2:209).

[3] PSV had two terms for both ‘blood’ and ‘excrement’, one of which involves a specific possessor while the
    other refers to the substance in isolation without being linked to any possessor (Lynch 2001c:259).

3.3.4 Bone

Two POc forms are reconstructed for ‘bone’, _*tuqan_/_tuqa-_ and _*suRi-_. The former appears to
be the formally irregular continuation of PMP _*tuqelan_. The expected POc form is †_*tuqolan_,
but we are inferring that the medial _*-e-_ of _*tuqelan_, phonetically schwa, was first lost, and the
resulting _*-ql-_ sequence was then simplified to _*-q-_.[4] POc _*suRi-_ on the other hand is evidently
a POc innovation.[5] Certain SE Solomonic and Polynesian languages reflect both, with a
difference in meaning. In SE Solomonic languages apparent reflexes of _*tuqa-_ mean
‘leg’ (listed under ‘cf. also’) and reflexes of _*suRi-_ mean ‘bone’. Lau (SES) has _suli-_ ‘bone’ and
what looks like a reflex of _*tuqa-_ in _ua-sifo_ ‘bone marrow’, but forms with _ua-_ are not listed
elsewhere in Fox (1974). PPn _*tuqa_ meant ‘back’, whilst POc _*suRi-_ is continued as ‘bone’ in
Poynesian languages.

    The areas in which reflexes of each term occur (in the meaning ‘bone’) are interlaced
across the Pacific, as follows:

__table
_*tuqa-_                      |                _*suRi-_
  NGOc (= NNG, PT)          |                  Adm
  Parts of MM               |                  Parts of MM
  Mic                       |                  SES, TM, SOc (= NCV, SV, NCal)
  W and E Fijian            |                  E Fijian, Pn

   The interlacing is particularly intricate in Meso-Melanesian languages and in Fiji. The
distribution of reflexes in Meso-Melanesian is shown below. Where individual languages are
shown, these are in italics. The languages constituting the Bali-Vitu, Willaumez, Tungag/Nalik
and Madak groups are listed in Appendix B. Reflexes of the two terms are split across the tiny
Tabar group. They are also split across the St George linkage, but this is less surprising, as ‘St
George’ is a large group, of which southern New Ireland microgroups and languages, as well
as NW Solomonic, are probably first-order subgroups.[6] Reflexes are also split within NW
Solomonic, in particular cutting across the Nehan/N Bougainville (NNB) subgroup.[7]

[4] Blust (ACD) takes _*tuqelan_ ‘bone’ to have no Oceanic reflexes but reconstructs POc _*tuqa_ with the sense
    ‘back’. Our data do not support this as the primary gloss.

[5] Blust (1993, 2009) reconstructed PCEMP _*zuRi_ ‘bone’ as parent of POc _*suRi_, but the ACD now attributes
    its CMP reflexes to PMP _*duRi_ ‘thorn, splinter, fishbone’, continued as POc _*(dr,r)uRi_ ‘thorn’ (vol.1:125).

[6] The Patpatar microgroup includes the Patpatar, Minigir and Tolai languages, the Label microgroup Label
    and Bilur, the Kandas microgroup Kandas and Ramoaaina, the Buka microgroup Solos, Halia and Selau.

[7] A significant part of NW Solomonic is missing from the list because Torau, Mono-Alu, Nduke, and the
    Santa Isabel languages reflect *suma ‘bone’.

                                                                                 The human body 85

                                        |           New Georgia

    Why did POc have two different words for ‘bone’? There are two clues to a difference in
meaning. The first is, as noted above, that *tuqa- reflexes in SE Solomonic and in some E
Fijian languages mean ‘leg’. The second is that in a few languages reflexes of _*suRi_ also
denote a bone needle (vol.1:87). Do these facts perhaps mean that _*suRi_ referred principally to
finer bones, _*tuqan_ to larger bones or to all bones? The evidence is hardly compelling, as
reflexes of both terms are used of the spine in a few languages. An answer of a different kind
is that the two terms were used in different POc dialects. This would entail the inference that
the Meso-Melanesian and Fijian linkages each emerged from at least two different dialects.
That genealogically separated dialects may become integrated into a new dialect chain is
shown by Geraghty’s (1983) work on Fijian dialects. In the case of the Meso-Melanesian
groups located on New Ireland (those other than Bali-Vitu, Willaumez and NW Solomonic)
there is some independent evidence of such a history (Ross 1988:306–307).

    Some Polynesian reflexes of POc _*tuqan_ refer rather to the rough or outer side of a body
part, although some compounds refer to backbone or to other prominent bony ridges such as
the shin. Lihir (MM) displays two reflexes of _*tuqan_, meaning ‘bone’ and ‘back’ respectively,
and the Tangga reflex has both senses. It is of interest that the unrelated Lau (SES) term _ʔogi-_
also means ‘a bone, the back, the outside of a thing’.

    The final _*-n_ of _*tuqan_ is reflected among the reflexes below as final _-n_ or pre-final _-n-_ in
the PT languages Muyuw and Kilivila and the MM languages Lavongai, Tigak, Kara, Tiang,
Nalik and Taiof.

   Reflexes of PPn _*tuqa_ ‘back, outer side’ can be used in compounds to identify a part of the
body that is seen as the outer or upper side of a limb or other body part, (cf. alo ‘smooth, soft
side of a thing < POc _*qarop_, §3.4.7). The emphasis here has almost entirely moved from
bone or bony parts, apart from single examples from Samoa (shin), Tikopia (shoulder blade)
and Hawaiian (shin).

    Three sets of seemingly irregular reflexes of POc _*suRi_ ‘bone’ are listed under ‘cf. also’
below. One consists of Vitiaz Strait (NNG) reflexes of Proto Korap and pre-Mangap _*tura-_,[8] a
second of Papuan Tip reflexes of Proto PT _*turiɣa_ ‘bone’. These may be irregular reflexes of
_*suRi-_ reflecting replacement of the initial consonant through contamination by _*tuqan_. The
third set consists of the Nyindrou and Micronesian terms, which reflect POc _*(dr,r)uRi_
‘thorn’ (vol.3:125). It seems that this may reflect a transfer of meaning from _*suRi-_ to the
formally similar _*(dr,r)uRi_.

3.3.5 Skin

There is a semantic difference between PWOc _*tini-_ ‘body, skin’ above, which denoted the
whole skin and metonymically the body, and the reconstructions in this section, which refer
only to skin itself, including the skins of animals and fruit as well as tree bark (vol.3:120). A
number of languages (Mota, Micronesian and Polynesian) show _-i-_ for expected _-u-_ in the first
syllable.

   The next reconstruction, POc _*pinut_ ‘skin, bark’ closely resembles two POc terms that
have been reconstructed for ‘coconut husk’, doublets _*punut_ and _*pʷenu(t)_ (vol.3:376–377).
However, most languages have separate terms for ‘skin’ and ‘coconut husk’. Only in some
NCV languages and in Misima and Lihir in the set above is an inclusive term found. It seems
that the resemblance of POc _*pinut_ ‘skin bark’ to the terms for coconut husk is fortuitous, as
with the exception of the Manam term the cognate set below agrees on _*-i-_ as the nucleus of
the first syllable, whilst almost all reflexes of *punut and _*pʷenu(t)_ agree on _*-u-_ and _*-e-_
respectively. A less likely possibility is that POc _*pinut_ was a doublet of _*punut_ and meant
‘skin, rind’.

handful of languages, but they are distributed across three subgroups.

3.3.7 Head hair

As noted in §3.3.8 Oceanic languages typically distinguish terms for head hair and body hair.
However, the two POc forms _*puRu_ ‘head hair’ (below) and _*pulu_ ‘body hair’ (§3.3.8) are
similar, and some contemporary forms could reflect either. In a number of languages of
Melanesia bird feathers are denoted by a reflex of POc _*puRu_ or POc _*ipu-_ ‘head hair,
feather’ (both below).

92 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross

   Although there are many reflexes of _*puRu_, they are with one exception limited to two
major subgroups, Admiralties and Meso-Melanesian. The exception is Gela (SES) _vuvulu-_.
Since POc _*-R-_ and _*-l-_ have merged in Gela, this form almost certainly reflects a conflation
of POc _*pulu-_ ‘body hair’ (§3.3.8) and POc _*puRu-_ ‘head hair’, an inference supported by its
gloss, which includes ‘head hair’, ‘feathers’ and ‘body hair’.

3.3.8 Body hair

Many Oceanic languages have distinct terms for body hair and head hair, although the two
reconstructions, POc _*pulu-_ ‘body hair’ (below) and POc _*puRu-_ ‘head hair’ (§3.3.7), are
similar, with some cognates that could reflect either. Reflexes of _*pulu-_ also denote animal fur.

96 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


Reflexes of both _*pulu-_ and _*puRu-_ denote bird feathers.[11] In a number of languages of
Melanesia, however, bird feathers are denoted by a reflex of POc _*ipu-_ ‘head hair,
feather’ (§3.3.7; for feathers, see vol.4:273–274).

   POc evidently also had a separate term for pubic hair (see below).

[11] A number of modern languages have a compound that implies the presence of the POc phrase
_*pulu qi manuk_ ‘_*pulu_ of bird’, i.e. ‘feathers’ (Motu (PT) _manu hui(na)_ and the Polynesian
languages Nukuoro _hulu manu_, Anuta _puru o manu_, Hawaiian _hulu manu_).

[12] In Vitu _-k_ has been added to certain inalienables (van den Berg & Bachet 2006), perhaps reflecting the
      POc free noun suffix _*-ki_, added to inalienables that were not possessed (Ross 2001b:273–274).

[13] The gloss suggests that this form reflects a conflation of POc _*pulu-_ ‘body hair’ and POc _*puRu-_ ‘head
     hair’ (§3.3.7) resulting from a merger of the reflexes of POc _*-l-_ and _*-R-_.

[14] Laghu _pulu-_ could also reflect POc _*puRu_ ‘head hair’, but the sense ‘pubic hair’ suggests that it reflects
     _*pulu_.

                                                                           The human body 97


    The cognate set below arguably reflects two functions of POc reduplication. The first
derived a noun that denotes a multiplicity of an object, in this case many hairs. The second,
sometimes with the addition of _*-ka_ or _*-a_, forms an adjectival noun that denotes a property
(this process formed various colour terms: vol.2:206, 210). It is possible that some or all of
these terms are not direct reflexes of POc etyma, but reflect later derivations by these
processes.

   Many Oceanic languages have no dedicated term for pubic hair and use a reflex of POc
_*pulu_ ‘body hair’ (§3.3.8), sometimes with a modifier. However, POc _*koRo_ ‘pubic hair’ is
evidenced by widely distributed reflexes.

3.3.9 Veins, arteries, sinews and tendons

The gloss of POc _*uRat_, which includes blood vessels, sinews and tendons, reflects their
common cord-like structure rather than their bodily function. This is even more true of the
following term, POc _*waRo(c)_ ‘generic term for vines and creepers; vein, string, rope’, which
applies to animal and human anatomy by extension.

    It appears that _*uRat_ was the usual POc term for cord-like parts of the internal anatomy. It
can be inferred that _*waRo(c)_ primarily denoted vines and creepers, as this is its most
widespread sense (vol.3:74), but was used colloquially of cord-like parts of anatomical items.
Below are listed only reflexes of POc _*waRo(c)_ that are glossed with an anatomical term.
Given its wide distribution, the extension from ‘vine, creeper’ to veins and tendons was
evidently already present in POc. NCV reflexes (under ‘cf. also’) indicate an idiosyncratic
change whereby POc _*waRo(c)_ became PNCV _*kaRo_ instead of expected †_*waRo_.
Micronesian languages apparently reflect contamination of POc *waRo(c) ‘vein,
string’ (vol.3:74) by POc _*wakaR_ ‘root’ (vol.3:99) with the result that the data point to the
reconstruction of PMic _*waka_ (Bender et al. 2003) rather than expected †_*wa(r)o_. Outright
conflation has occurred only in Pulo Annian, however, where _wāxa_/_waxa-_ means both ‘vein,
sinew, artery’ and ‘root’. Other Micronesian languages keep reflexes of PMic _*waka_ ‘vein,
artery, sinew’ separate from those of PMic _*waka_/_wakara_ ‘root’ because _*-r-_ is usually
reflected as _-r-_ in the latter (vol.3:99).

3.4      The head and its parts

There is a large collection of POc terms denoting the head and its parts. Terms for parts of the
head denote the forehead, brain, back of head (and nape), top of head (and fontanelle), face and
side of face (or cheek), eye, eyelash/eyebrow, eyebrow ridge, eyelid, eyeball, ear, nose, nostril,
mouth (outer and inner), lips, tongue, teeth (in general, molar and canine), gums, chin/jaw,
beard, neck, throat and voice.

    There are several terms for the head itself, their cognate sets and glosses suggesting
differences in their semantic range. The fact that POc _*qulu-_ (§3.4.1) also had a number of
metaphorical senses (‘chief’, ‘headwaters’, ‘prow of a boat’, ‘first-born’), as well as the more
specialised sense of ‘hair of the head’ and a use as a relational local noun meaning ‘top’
suggests that part of its meaning was the position of the head as the highest point of the body.
The glosses of _*bʷatu(k)_, on the other hand, appear to focus on its shape (§3.4.2).


3.4.1 *qulu ‘head’

The most widespread term for the head is _*qulu_. Blust (ACD) comments

__blockquote__
      Although only the meaning ‘head’ can be assigned to PAn _*quluh_, PMP _*quluh_ clearly had a
      number of meanings in addition to its primary use as a body-part label. Physical extensions
      of this primary sense include applications to the tops of trees, mountains and the like, and to
      the handles of bladed implements such as knives and axes. Somewhat more striking are
      widespread reflexes of *quluh in the meaning ‘headwaters of a river’, probably in the
      construction _*qulu ni wahiR_. … Reflexes of _*quluh_ apply not only to the upper part of
      objects, but also to the front part of objects (‘prow of a boat’) and to priority in time (‘first’,
      ‘first-born’).

Its meaning in POc clearly included such metaphorical extensions.

3.4.2 _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and _*pʷau-_ ‘head’

The three POc terms reconstructed below, _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’,
and _*pʷau-_ ‘head’, represent a solution to a reconstructive conundrum. We are confronted by two
overlapping pairs of reconstructions. The first pair, _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and _*bʷatu(k)_, are very similar in
form. They are also close enough in meaning that some reflexes of _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ mean ‘head’ rather
than ‘skull’. The second pair, _*bʷatu(k)_ and _*pʷau-_, both mean ‘head’, and form a puzzling
parallel to POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee’ (§3.6.8.1.1).

   We turn first to _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and _*bʷatu(k)_.


3.4.2.1 _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ (vs _*bʷatu(k)_)

Dempwolff (1938) reconstructed PMP _*batuk_ and glossed it as ‘skull’. Blust (ACD) retains this
gloss, but with a comment that it is problematic, as the only non-Oceanic reflexes are:

The glosses above suggest the possibility that PMP _*batuk_ meant ‘outer shell’, whether of the
skull or of, say, a nut. The CMP terms, in which _ulu-_ reflects PMP _*quluh_ ‘head’ (§3.4.1), thus
had the literal sense ‘shell of head’, i.e. ‘skull’, leading to the likelihood that the directly
inherited POc reflex of PMP _*batuk_ was not POc _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ but POc _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer
shell, skull’ below.[15] It is also possible that this _*(p,pʷ)atu_ shares history with POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_
‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ (§3.6.8.1.1), particularly if the latter referred specifically to the knee-cap,
itself an outer shell—but we have no direct evidence of this at the moment.

   It seems unlikely, however, that the formal and semantic similarity of _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ and
_*bʷatu(k)_ is due to chance, and more probable that both ultimately reflect PMP _*batuk_ ‘outer
shell’, with _*bʷatu(k)_ an indirect reflex—perhaps a loan from a language that retained PMP
_*b-_, perhaps the outcome of a piece of word-play or of some process that the data do not
reveal. Such splits in pre-Oceanic etyma did occur occasionally, as attested by the split of PMP
_*buaq_ ‘fruit’ into POc _*puaq_ ‘fruit’ (vol.3:115) and POc _*buaq_ ‘betelnut, areca
palm’ (vol.3:393; see the summary of Blust’s ACD discussion there). However, there is no
non-Oceanic evidence of such a split. The cognate set supporting _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ is given below,
and that supporting _*bʷatu(k)_ in §3.4.2.2.

   In the New Ireland languages Tigak, Kara and Lihir and Bougainville languages from Taiof
to Uruava below, the reflex of _*(p,pʷ)atu_ means ‘head’. This may reflect contamination by
_*bʷatu(k)_ or simple semantic shift.[16] Under ‘cf. also’ below are reflexes of Proto Central
Micronesian _*fatuku_ ‘head’, where _*f-_ is the regular reflex of POc _*p-_, not _*pʷ-_, but these
forms are also odd in reflecting final POc _*-k_ with a following echo vowel. These are thus not
regular reflexes and may reflect borrowing from an unknown source that retained POc final
consonants.

[15] This inference seems more plausible than Blust’s (ACD) that the CMP items reflect PMP _*batu_ ‘stone’
     rather than PMP _*batuk_.

[16] An alternative is that we have misread the sound correspondence, as there are very few Bougainville reflexes
     of terms that include _*bʷ_.

    Also below is a cognate set reflecting POc _*[(p,pʷ)atu](p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘hard, strong, firm’. We take
this to be a reduplication of _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’, an inference supported by both form
(POc attributes were commonly formed by reduplication; vol.2:206–220) and meaning.

    In two instances below, Bariai _(eau) pat_ ‘coconut shell container for water’ and Takia _pat-pat_
‘strong, hard’, there is homophony with the term for ‘stone’, _pat_ in both cases, reflecting
POc _*patu_ ‘stone, rock’ (vol.2:62–63). We take this to be the result of chance. In languages
where _*pʷ-_ and _*p-_ are differently reflected, reflexes of _*(p,pʷ)atu_ and _*patu_ are not homophonous,
as indicated in parentheses below.

3.4.2.2 _*bʷatu(k)_ and _*pʷau-_

As noted in §3.4.2, _*bʷatu(k)_ and _*pʷau-_ both mean ‘head’, and form a puzzling parallel to POc
_*pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee’ (§3.6.8.1.1). The two pairs
overlap conceptually, as reflexes of both entail the sense ‘knob, node, joint’. Formally, all four
reconstructions begin with a labiovelar consonant _*bʷ_ or _*pʷ_, and have the same vowels, but
the first member of each pair has a medial _*-t-_ where the second member doesn’t. Moreover,
the members of each pair disagree in the voicing of the initial labiovelar. The first pair displays
_*bʷ-_/_*pʷ-_, the second pair the reverse.

    Are any of the four reconstructions related to each other? Near-homophony between terms
for head/skull and knee/elbow occurs across subgroups and echoes a polysemy between terms
for ‘head’ and ‘knee’ in Tarascan (a Mexican isolate), in several Mayan languages where the
term for knee, _nah ch’ehk_, is literally ‘head (_nah_) of lower leg’, and in Finnish where the term
for elbow, _kynärpää_, is literally ‘head (_paa_) of cubit’ (Anderson 1978:354-355). Anderson
suggests the polysemy is based on structural similarity (rounded boniness?).

    A fairly exhaustive listing of known reflexes is given here and in §3.6.8.1.1 as a basis for
answering the questions these forms raise. There are several possible answers, of course. The
similarities between the four forms may be due to chance, or the four forms may reflect one or
more etyma that have undergone a formal and semantic split, and/or the modern forms may
reflect contamination of one form by another formally and semantically similar form.

    The most conservative response has been chosen here: to make four separate reconstruc-
tions, as there is sufficient semantic and formal consistency within each set to justify this.
There are several other reasons for this choice.

    Lynch (2002e) merges POc _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee;
joint, node’ into a single set, but the initial labiovelar correspondences do not justify the
merger. All reflexes of POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ in §3.6.8.1.1 reflect _*pʷ-_. All the reflexes of POc
_*bʷatu(k)_ below reflect _*bʷ-_. Lynch also merges POc _*pʷau-_ ‘head’ and PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee’,
and for this there is formal support. The non-Southern Oceanic reflexes of POc _*pʷau-_ are
regular, but the Southern Oceanic (NCV, SV and NCal) reflexes point to PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘head’,
i.e. the same form as PSOc *bwau- ‘knee, joint’. If these two sets reflected a single etymon,
however, one would expect some of its reflexes to mean both ‘head’ and ‘joint’. In fact this
happens only in Sye (SV), where _no-mpu_ occurs in both sets. It thus seems safer to infer that in
Sye the reflexes of the two etyma have merged, whilst other languages have kept them
separate. It could also be inferred, however, that PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘head’ is a reflex of POc _*pʷau-_
‘head’ whose initial _*bʷ-_ reflects contamination from PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee, joint’.

    This leaves the question, Did POc _*pʷau-_ ‘head’ and PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee’ arise respectively
from POc _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head, top of’ and POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ through loss
of _*-t-_? Perhaps, but it seems unlikely, first because loss of _*-t-_ has not otherwise been
observed in POc etyma, and second because the seemingly shortened forms reflect initial
consonants with the opposite voicing value from the forms with _*-t-_. This gives us four
different etyma that display intriguing semantic and formal relationships that remain
unexplained.

Reflexes of POc _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ are also used metaphorically to refer to the upper part of
things, e.g. Mota _pʷat panei_ ‘shoulder’ (‘head of arm’). From the SE Solomons eastward there
are reflexes with extended senses such as ‘lump’ and ‘knob’, and what appears to be a further
extension to denote a weapon with a large knob on the end (‘knobstick’, ‘club’). Polynesian
reflexes have either the latter meaning or denote a lump on the human body or a tree.

    Note that Malaita-Makira (SES) languages lose POc _*-t-_ regularly. Hence Lau _gʷau-_ etc
are taken above to reflect _*bʷatu-_. The items in the set below are from languages where _*-t-_ is
retained: its absence, along with reflexes of initial _*pʷ-_ indicates that these items reflect POc
_*pʷau-_, not _*bʷatu-_.

3.4.3 Forehead

Three POc terms for ‘forehead’ are reconstructed, only one of which, *raqe-, has a PAn
antecedent. POc _*dramʷa-_, reflected in Adm, NNG, MM and Mic, was evidently an Oceanic
innovation. POc _*p(u,o)le-_ has a more limited basis, with reflexes from the Admiralties and a
cluster of north Bougainville languages. Its medial vowel is uncertain. To our knowledge no
contemporary language has two of these terms side by side, suggesting that they reflect
dialectal variation in very early Oceanic.

3.4.4 Brain

Two distinct meanings, ‘brain’ and ‘pith’, are carried by the same term in sporadic reflexes of
both POc _*qutok_ (vol.3:374) and POc _*paraq_ (vol.3:373). Non-Oceanic evidence indicates that
_*qutok_ was the inherited term for the brain, whilst the use of _*paraq_ for brain represents an
extension of its earlier meaning, ‘coconut embryo’. The link between brain and coconut
embryo is further supported by the Mussau terms _laŋasi_ ‘brain’, _laŋasi niu_ ‘pith of young
coconut’ and Niuean _uho-niu_, originally referring to ‘the spongy heart of sprouting coconut’,
but by extension also to ‘brain’. It is also noteworthy that brain and bone marrow are referred to
by one term, _hara_, in Motu, and _oso-_ in ’Are’are.

    A comparison of Blust’s (ACD) non-Oceanic reflexes of PMP _*hutek_ with those of POc
_*qutok_ shows that the latter certainly denoted the brain and probably also bone marrow, and
(non-Oceanic) Ambonese reflexes are consistent with the hypothesis that it was also used for
the pith of plants. The sporadic occurrence of reflexes of POc _*paraq_ that denote the brain
(vol.3:373), however, may be the result of independent parallel innovation. That is, the ‘brain’
sense of _*paraq_ may not have been present in POc.

    The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ display phonological irregularities. The SES forms have a
medial consonant where none is expected, as POc _*t_ is lost in these languages. Tikopia has
initial _k-_ where no consonant is expected.

3.4.5 Back of head, nape

3.4.6 Top of head, fontanelle

In a number of languages the term for the fontanelle is a reflex of POc _*[ma]ñawa_, which was
evidently a verb meaning ‘breathe, rest, be alive’, but also occurred as a noun with the senses
‘breath’, ‘life’ and ‘fontanelle’. The full cognate set for this term is presented in §4.5.1, where it
is discussed in some detail. Here just those reflexes that include the sense ‘fontanelle’ are given.
Note that the fontanelle provides a visible pulse in a young baby and is thus representative of
life. The extension from ‘breath’ via ‘pulse’ to fontanelle is thus a natural one. The fontanelle is
regarded in some parts of Oceania (e.g. Arosi) as where the soul entered and departed from the
body.

   POc _*maŋawa-_ ‘fontanelle, forehead’ is apparently a doublet of POc _*mañawa_, related to it
by an irregular sound change _*ñ_ > _*ŋ_. Some reflexes of _*maŋawa-_ denote the forehead rather
than the fontanelle, presumably as a result of a metonymic usage extending reference to the
whole of the front part of the top of the head.

3.4.7 Face

Although two POc terms, _*nako-_ and _*qarop-_, are listed here, *qarop- was principally a spatial
term (a relational local noun; §3.1.2) referring to ‘front, face, the side usually seen’ (vol.2:247)
whereas _*nako-_ denoted the body part containing facial features and was only secondarily a
spatial term. A third term POc _*mata-_ (§3.4.9.1 and vol.2:249) was apparently also commonly
used to refer to ‘face’ as well as ‘eyes’.

    Reflexes of POc *qarop consistently refer to ‘front, face, the side usually seen’ and are
sometimes contrasted with reflexes of POc _*muri-_ ‘back’ (§3.1.2, vol.2:251). In this sense
they are often used to refer to parts of the body other than the face. Evidence for final _*-p_ lies
in phrases such as Tongan _ʔaofi-vaʔe_ and Samoan _alofi-vae_, both ‘sole of foot’, where _-i-_
reflects the PPn linker _*qi_ (Hooper 1985).

3.4.8 Side of face, cheek, temple

Two POc etyma, _*[pʷa]pʷaRa-_ ‘cheek, side of face’ and _*baba[R,l]i-_ ‘cheek’ appear to reflect
Blust’s PCEMP _*papaR_ ‘cheek’ (ACD). However, two comments are in order. First, PCEMP
_*papaR_ is supported by only one non-Oceanic reflex (Buru _papa-n_ ‘cheek’), with the
consequence that there is no independent attestation of PCEMP _*-R-_ or of the vowel following
it. Second, POc doublets are rare, and it is possible that the two etyma have different origins.
Both have reflexes that simply mean ‘side’, but it is common for POc relational local nouns to
be derived from human body part terms (cf. POc _*bʷal(o,a)-_ ‘belly, inside’, vol.2:239; _*qaro-_
‘face, front’, vol.2:247; *mata- ‘eye, front’, vol.2:249). A stronger possibility is that POc
_*baba[R,l]i-_ is indeed a doublet, created through contamination by POc _*baban_ ‘flat, board,
plank of boat’ (vol.1:185–186) because of its reference to a bone with a flat surface. Reflexes of
POc _*baban_ are sometimes used in this sense (cf. To’aba’ita _baba-leqo_, Maori _papa-āhuahua_,
both ‘shoulder blade’), and it is possible that Proto Eastern Polynesian _*papa-ariŋa_ ‘cheek’
reflects such a compound.[20]

3.4.9.2 Eyelash, eyebrow hair

The glosses below suggest that ‘eyelash’ and ‘eyebrow hair’ were denoted by a single POc
term, _*pulu qi mata-_ literally ‘hair of eye’. POc _*pulu-_ was the term for body hair (§3.3.8) as
opposed to head hair. On _*qi_, see Hooper (1985), Ross (1998a) and §3.1.1.

Kukuya _mata-ivu_ ‘eyelash’ is a conceptually similar term, but _ivu_ reflects _*ipu_ ‘hair’ (§3.3.7).

   Numbami (NNG) has _mata-lami_ ‘eyelash’ and Nyindrou (Adm) has _lami mada-_ ‘eyelash,
eyebrow’, each containing an apparent reflex of POc _*Ramut_ ‘fine, hair-like roots’ (vol.3:101).

   The next set probably shows metaphoric use of a term also used to describe the fringe-like
leaflets of a coconut branch (see Arosi, Sa’a, ’Are’are _hisi_, Lau _fisi_). Note that in MM and SES
languages the possessor follows the possessed whilst in PT languages the order is reversed.

3.4.9.3 Eyebrow ridge

Widely distributed reflexes of POc _*pasu-_ denote ‘eyebrow’, but scattered among them are
reflexes meaning ‘forehead’ and, in Vanuatu, also ‘cheek’. Ancestral to the POc term is PMP
_*pasu(ŋ)_, which Blust (ACD) glosses ‘cheek bone’. However, in addition to ‘cheek’ the non-Oceanic
reflexes have meanings as varied as ‘prominent cheek bones’, ‘upper jawbone’,
‘bridge of the nose’. The common denominator across both Malayo-Polynesian and Oceanic
glosses seems to be ‘facial bony ridge’ and this may well have been its extended sense at both
interstages. However, its narrower PMP meaning does indeed seem to have been ‘cheek bone’.
This was perhaps also its narrower POc gloss, with a semantic shift to ‘eyebrow ridge’, then
‘eyebrow’, in various daughter-languages. In this light, complex expressions for ‘eyebrow’
below which include a reflex of POc *mata- ‘eye’ (§3.4.9.1) apparently meant ‘ridge of eye’,
i.e. ‘eyebrow ridge’, as opposed to other facial ridges, particularly the cheek bone.

    The compound forms in Loniu, Port Sandwich, Nguna, Iaai and Rotuman all point to POc
_*pasu-mata-_, but Nokuku _pus-pusa-n meta-_ contains a suffix _-n_ which reflects either POc
_*-ña_ ‘his, her, its’ or _*ni_, a morpheme that marked the following noun phrase as the
nonspecific possessor of an indirectly possessed noun, e.g. POc ? _*pasu ni mata-_ ‘ridge of
eye’. This reconstruction is odd, however, as POc _*pasu-_ was directly possessed, and the
nonspecific possessor of a directly possessed noun was introduced by _*qi_ (Ross 1998c; also
§3.1.1), i.e. the expected form is POc _*pasu qi mata-_. In a number of languages the reflex of
_*ni_ has displaced _*qi_, and Nokuku may be one of these.

    The eyebrows perhaps had a particular cultural significance for Proto Oceanic speakers.
The Sinaugoro and Nguna terms below refer to raising the eyebrows to say ‘yes’, and it seems
likely that the gesture already had this meaning in Proto Oceanic times.

3.4.9.4 Eyelid

Although a possible PEOc compound can be reconstructed from SES and NE Ambae terms
which translate literally as ‘eye skin’, there is little consistency of form across the Oceanic
region, with a range of terms being used in place of ‘skin’ including ‘cover’, ‘husk’, and ‘leaf’.
PEOc _*pinu-pinu_ is a reduplicated reflex of POc _*pinut_ ‘skin, bark’ (§3.3.5).

3.4.9.5 Eyeball

The eyeball is sometimes referred to by compounds which include a term meaning something
like the kernel or flesh or substance of the eye. Reflexes of POc _*kanoŋ_ ‘flesh, meat, coconut
flesh’ (vol.3:370) combined with reflexes of _*mata_ ‘eye’ are used to refer to ‘eyeball’ in a
number of languages, pointing to POc _*kanoŋ qi mata_ ‘eyeball’.

3.4.10 Ear

POc _*taliŋa-_ was not only the term for ‘ear’ but also the generic term for mushrooms and
fleshy fungi (vol.3:78). The association between the two was presumably based either on visual
similarity or on the fact that fungi often grow on trees in the rain forest just as ears appear to
grow on the side of the human head. That the association had a conceptual basis is attested by
the fact that in certain Oceanic languages where the term for ‘ear’ is not a reflex of POc
_*taliŋa-_, the ‘ear’ term is still the generic term for fungi.

    There is also evidence for POc _*bʷa(l,R)usu-_ ‘nose’. Its SE Solomonic and Micronesian
reflexes form part of the evidence on which Blust (1984b, 2010) bases his Malaitan-Micronesian
subgroup. In the context of the additional cognates listed here, his Proto
Malaitan-Micronesian _*pʷaRusu-_ is less convincing as a uniquely shared innovation. Blust
dismisses Lou _pursu-_ as a ‘chance resemblance’ on the grounds that Lou _-r-_ does not reflect
_*-R-_ (it reflects _*-r-_). The _-l-_ of the MM reflexes here also fails to agree with the Micronesian
reflexes as the former reflect POc _*-l-_, the latter POc _*-R-_ (the SES cognates reflect either _*-l-_
or _*-R-_). Whatever the reason for these discrepancies, it is difficult to attribute the
resemblances across the set to chance.

    This set is rendered more difficult by the presence of a number of look-alikes in NCV
languages (a sample is given under ‘cf. also’). Of these, the most attention grabbing is Sowa
(Pentecost) _bʷa-ŋsu-_ (Tryon 1976), where nearby Apma has _ŋusu-_, presumably reflecting POc
_*ŋuju-_ ‘external mouth, lips, snout, beak’ (§3.4.12.1) and suggesting that Sowa _bʷa-ŋsu-_
reflects _*bʷa-_ + _*ŋuju-_. This in turn raises the question whether the same _*bʷa-_ occurs in the
reconstruction below, but the evidence does not allow a clear answer. Araki _ŋalsu-_, Aore
_kalsu-_, Lendamboi _na-gars-_ and Nisvai _na-gursu-_ are typical of the Santo and Malakula forms
which complicate the picture yet more. None of them reflects _*bʷa-_, but Araki and Aore
include the sequence _lsu-_, perhaps cognate with _lisu-_, the term for ‘nose’ in Maewo languages.
Is it also cognate with the MM and SES forms? One cannot be sure.

3.4.11.2   Channel above the upper lip

Although a number of reflexes of POc _*ŋoro-ŋorok_ are glossed ‘nose’ (and by extension ‘cape’;
vol 2:48), the term apparently referred in POc times to ‘channel above upper lip’, its meaning
transferred independently in daughter-languages. Given their formal and semantic similarity it
is reasonable to infer that PNCV _*ŋori_ reflects POc *ŋoro-ŋorok, despite the irregular final
vowel. We take _*ŋoro-ŋorok_ to be a reduplicated form of the noun _*ŋorok_ ‘snot’ (§3.8.3) and/or
the verb _*ŋorok_ ‘grunt, growl, snore’ (§4.5.3).

3.4.12 The mouth and its parts

Four POc terms referring to the mouth have been reconstructed: _*ŋuju-_, _*[pʷa]pʷa(q)_, _*qawa_
and _*maŋa_. POc _*ŋuju-_ probably referred to the external mouth and lips, its reflexes sometimes
extending to bird’s beak or nose, while POc _*[pʷa]pʷa(q)_ referred to the inner mouth or
opening and _*qawa_ perhaps had the broader meaning ‘opening into a passage or channel’. POc
_*maŋa_ may have referred more broadly to an opening. Other extensions of its meaning are to a
particularly shaped opening such as a slit or vagina, or opening as in a passage through a reef.

3.4.12.1 External mouth

Blust (ACD) glosses PAn _*ŋusuq_ ‘nasal area, snout’. We add ‘mouth’ here, as glosses referring
to ‘mouth’ are found across Austronesian subgroups.

3.4.12.2 Lips

The data support two POc reconstructions for ‘lips’, _*[pi]piRi-_ and _*[bi]biRi-_, both reflecting
PAn _*biRbiR_, PMP _*bibiR_. As noted in vol.2 (p18), PMP _*b_ became either POc _*p_ or POc _*b_,
in initial position more commonly _*p-_. In almost every instance Oceanic cognates reflect either
POc _*p-_ or POc _*b-_, but not both. In this instance, however, PMP _*bibiR_ has given rise to two
etyma, POc _*[pi]piRi-_ and POc _*[bi]biRi-_. We have no explanation for PWOc _*b-_ in this
instance.

   Finally, some Oceanic languages have a term for ‘mouth’ that reflects POc _*maŋa(p)_
(V) ‘to open wide, gape’, (N) ‘open mouth; gap, space’. The supporting cognate set is
given in §4.5.5. POc _*maŋa(p)_ in its turn reflected PMP _*q<um>aŋa[p,b]_ ‘gape, open
the mouth wide’ (where _*<um>_ was the PMP actor voice infix; §1.3.5.5). Blust (ACD)
attributes two of these reflexes, Arosi _maŋa_ ‘an opening, mouth’ and Bauan Fijian
_maŋa_ ‘vagina’, to PMP _*maŋaq_ ‘slit, crevice’ (ACD). However, the glosses of the set
of Oceanic reflexes in §4.5.5 include a range of meanings centring on ‘opening, aperture’
(‘mouth’, ‘vagina’, ‘space between earth and sky’), pointing to a more probable
origin in PMP _*q<um>aŋa[p,b]_ rather than PMP _*maŋaq_. But, since the two PMP
terms would have had near-identical POc reflexes, one could argue that the cognate
set supporting POc _*maŋa(p)_ reflects a conflation of the two terms.

-- FIXME: erratum vol2 --

[22] In vol.2:.111 PPn _*awa_ was incorrectly listed as a reflex of POc _*sawa(n,ŋ)_
‘channel, passage’ with unexplained loss of _*s-_.

3.4.12.4 Tongue

There are two related POc reconstructions for ‘tongue’, _*maya-_ and a compound that includes
it, _*kara-maya-_. The origin of _*kara-_ in the latter is unknown.

     Most reflexes of _*maya-_ entail a reduction of _*-ay-_ or _*-ya-_ to _-e-_, but the Bariai, Kilivila
and Roro reflexes point to _*maya-_. The compound is reconstructed as _*kara-maya-_ rather than
_*kara-mea-_, on the model of _*maya-_.

3.4.12.5 Teeth

POc _*nipo-_ and POc _*lipo-_ ‘tooth’ coexisted. Both _*n-_ and _*l-_ forms are reconstructable at least
as far back as PAn, and both must be attributed to POc. The fact that the two forms have existed
side by side for such a long time is intriguing, as there is no difference in meaning. Kwaio is the
only language among the data sources that reflects both.

    In a number of languages the term for teeth is a reflex of POc _*ŋisi_ or _*[ŋi]ŋisa_, both
glossed ‘bare one’s teeth, grin’. Since these forms were evidently verbs, they are discussed in
§4.7.2.

With regard to the relationship between PMP _*baReqaŋ_ and POc _*paRa(ŋ)_ Blust (ACD) notes
that

__blockquote__
       medial _*-e-_ in a trisyllable is retained in PAn _*baqeRu_ > POc _*paqoRu_ ‘new’. The
       suggested loss of PMP _*e_ and reduction of the resulting consonant cluster in POc _*paRaŋ_
       ‘molar tooth’ may indicate very specific conditions for deletion of _*e_ between PMP and
       POc. Alternatively, the resemblance of Arosi hara to phonetically and semantically similar
       forms in non-Oceanic languages may be due to chance.

However, the occurrence of the Lukep and Tuam forms alongside Arosi _hara-_ indicates that the
resemblance is not fortuitous.

    Two further vaguely similar reconstructions for ‘molar tooth’ can be reconstructed. In the
set reflecting _*ŋaRo-_ the gloss of Misima _nalu-_ ‘gums’ suggests that it reflects POc _*ŋado-_
‘gums’ (§3.4.12.6), but this is probably a case of contamination of one form by the other. Note
in any case that two reflexes of PWOc _*mʷao-_ ‘molar tooth’ below instead denote the gums,
i.e. this is perhaps a fairly common extension of meaning.

3.4.13 Chin, jaw and beard

Austronesian languages usually lack separate words for ‘chin’, i.e. the outward shape of the
lowest and frontmost part of the lower jaw, and the lower ‘jaw’ itself. They are typically
denoted in Oceanic languages by a reflex of POc _*qase-_ or by a compound that apparently
contains a reflex of POc _*qase-_. PPn _*kau-qahe_ ‘cheek, chin, jawbone’ is evidently such a
compound. PPn _*kau_ meant ‘edge, side’, and _*kau-qahe_ presumably once meant ‘edge of jaw’,
i.e. ‘chin’, but with the loss of PPn _*qahe_ ‘jaw’, _*kau-qahe_ came to subsume ‘chin’ and ‘jaw’.
Another possible compound, POc _*(k,g)abase-_ ‘chin; jawbone’, is discussed below.

                                                                        The human body 135


    The term for ‘beard’, POc _*kumi-_, was clearly distinct from the term for ‘chin, jaw’, but its
meaning has been extended to include the latter in a number of languages.

    POc _*(k,g)abase-_ ‘chin; jawbone’ at first sight appears to have been a compound of
_*(k,g)abV_ (meaning unknown) and _*qase-_ ‘chin, jaw’, but only the Lou and Baluan reflexes
straightfowardly reflect the reconstructed vowels (and disagree on the initial consonant). Bipi
and the Meso-Melanesian reflexes instead reflect a possible POc _*(k,g)abesi-_ or _*(k,g)abise-_,
suggesting that the POc form was a trisyllable with perhaps three different vowels (apparently
_*a_, _*i_ and _*e_) which underwent various metatheses and/or assimilations.

3.4.14 Neck, throat, voice

Modern Oceanic languages typically have four separate monomorphemic lexical items
denoting parts of the neck region: ‘neck’ (viewed from the outside), ‘voice’, ‘throat’ (inside the
neck) and ‘nape’ (back of neck/base of skull’). For ‘nape’, see §3.4.5. Examples of the first
three terms are given below. Some languages also have monomorphemic terms for the Adam’s
apple and the gullet, but sources typically omit these meanings.

The most detailed source available to us is Pawley & Sayaba’s (2003) dictionary of Wayan
Fijian, according to which _-domo_ ‘neck’ is also used for voice, overlapping semantically with
_-lio_ (both terms are also used of animal vocalisations). Doubtless overlaps of the kind indicated
by the definitions of the Wayan terms also occur in other Oceanic languages but are not
recorded by our sources. The only language here to collapse two of these terms is To’aba’ita,
where the meaning of _lua-_, originally ‘neck’ (from POc _*Ruqa-_), has been extended to ‘throat’,
presumably after a period of overlap.

    Evidently POc also had a three-way distinction among ‘neck’, ‘voice’ and ‘throat’, but four
terms are reconstructed. The assignment of the first three is straightforward, but the meaning
of _*kadro-_ is problematic (see below).

__block__
-   _*Ruqa-_ ‘neck’
-   _*[qa]liŋa-_ ‘voice’
-   _*[qa]liqoR_ ‘throat’
-   _*kadro-_ ‘neck ?’

   _*Ruqa-_ ‘neck’ has largely retained its meaning throughout all subgroups, although isolated
terms have extended or relocated reference to nearby body parts.

    POc _*[qa]liŋa-_ ‘voice’ is reflected in languages as far east as the southeast Solomons, but
its reflexes are not found further east. East and south of the Solomons, the term for voice is a
reflex of POc _*[qa]liqoR_ ‘throat’.

     Even closely related languages vary as to whether _*qa-_ is included.[24]

   POc _*kadro-_ ‘neck’ has reflexes only in Mussau and Western Oceanic, and seems to have
referred to the neck region generally, to judge from the compound terms for its parts in
Mussau and Motu. Thus it appears to have been a (near-)synonym of POc _*Ruqa-_.

3.5     Parts of the trunk

Terms for the trunk itself are given alongside those for ‘body’ in §3.2.2. Terms for the parts of
the torso or trunk are arranged such that those for the back are presented first, followed by those
for parts of the trunk moving from the top (shoulder) to the bottom (buttocks and genitalia).

3.5.1 Back

POc _*takuRu-_ ‘back’ clearly denoted a location, i.e. the posterior surface of an object, and
specifically the posterior surface of the human body. But did it also denote the spine as a body
part? The answer appears to be ‘no’, in that very few glosses of its reflexes include ‘spine’ or
‘backbone’ (often encoded with a compound involving the term for ‘bone’), and Oceanic
languages typically have separate terms for back and backbone.

   Another reconstruction sometimes used to refer to the back as a body part is the relational
local noun POc _*muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after; (canoe) stern;
space outside’ (§3.1.2 and vol.2:251).

3.5.3 Shoulder

POc _*[qa]paRa-_ ‘shoulder’ has usually been reconstructed as a straightforward trisyllable (i.e.
_*qapara_), but well distributed reflexes (Gitua, Nakanai, Halia, Selau, Torau, Mono-Alu,
Nduke, Lungga, Gela, Big Nambas) lack initial _*qa-_. The same is true of a number of non-Oceanic
reflexes listed in the ACD. POc _*[qa]paRa-_ is thus one of a small number of trisyllabic
body part nouns which consist of a disyllabic root (the most common form of POc roots) and
apparently had forms with and without POc _*qa-_. Other forms of this kind are POc _*[qa]liŋa-_
‘voice’, POc _*[qa]liqoR_ ‘neck, throat’ (both §3.4.14) and POc _*[qa]nunu_ ‘shadow of person,
likeness, reflection’ (§3.9.1). Whilst we can describe this pattern, we do not know its function
or why alternants apparently survived side by side over a long period.[26]

    As noted in §3.4.2 some Oceanic languages refer to the shoulder as the ‘head/knob of arm’,
but we cannot say how old this expression is.

[25] The gloss ‘flat object or surface’ was omitted in volume 1.

[26] A few nouns which label plants or animals display the same pattern: PWOc _*[qa]pwasu_ ‘taro leaves’ (?)
     (vol.3:269), PEOc _*[qa]ŋaRi_ ‘canarium almond’ (vol.3:315), POc _*[qa]paliR_ ‘surgeonfish’ (vol 4:103),
     POc _*[qa]nupe_ ‘caterpillar or k.o. sea cucumber’ (vol.4:206), POc _[qa]yawan_ ‘strangler fig’ (vol.3:303),
     POc _*[qa]pator_ ‘sago grub, edible’ (vol.4:404), POc _*[qa]liliŋ_ ‘tapestry turban shell’ (vol.4:182), POc
     _*[qa]lipan_ ‘centipede’ (vol.4:406). Some of these are reconstructed without the _*qa_-less alternant, but
     reflexes reflect absence of _*qa-_. The only discernible regularity regarding the presence or absence of _*qa-_ in
     reflexes is that it is apparently always absent in Gela, with a tendency towards absence in other Guadalcanal
     languages and in New Ireland languages—but absences also occur elsewhere.

3.5.5 Chest

POc _*[Ruma]Ruma-_ ‘chest’ is perhaps derived from POc _*Rumaq_ ‘house’ (vol.1:48). If a
Lapita house is viewed as underlyingly a rough-hewn wooden framework (see the illustration
on p53 of vol.1), then the metaphorical extension of ‘house’ to the chest cavity as a whole,
bounded by the rib cage and the spine, is visually quite obvious. The same metaphor led to the
extension of a reflex of POc _*kaso_ ‘rafters’ to the upper rib cage reflected in PPn _*kaso-kaso_
(§3.5.6).

[27] Final _*-k-_ probably the Vitu reflex of POc _*-ki_ ‘not possessed’. See footnote 12.

3.5.6 Rib cage

Probably there was no POc word that meant ‘rib’. Instead, POc speakers, like the speakers of a
good many Oceanic languages, had a term for ‘rib cage’, and used a composite term meaning
‘bone of rib cage’ or ‘bone of side’ for rib.[28]

     Pn:  Sikaiana              |ivi vakavaka    |    [bone rib.cage]   ‘rib’

[28] A term with the gloss ‘rib’ does occur in a number of sources. In some cases at least this appears to be an
     error for ‘ribs’ or ‘rib cage’.

146 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


    As the glosses of some of the terms above imply, at least some Oceanic speakers evidently
perceive the rib cage as two ‘sides’ of ribs (such that a rib is a ‘bone of side’). Thus Dami _siri-_
above reflects POc _*siriŋ_ ‘side’ (vol.2:246). The best candidate for reconstruction with the
meaning ‘side of ribs’ is POc _*kabe-_ ‘(lower?) rib cage, side’. Whether this also meant ‘side’
in a generalised locative sense is not clear.

<
POc *kabe- ‘one side of rib cage’
 Adm: Nyindrou             kabe(de-)           ‘side, ribs’
 NNG: Mapos Buang          kʷbe-               ‘side, rib’

However, POc _*kabe-_ is apparently not reflected in Eastern Oceanic languages. Here, certain
more localised reconstructions are possible. If Bola _karo-_ ‘ribs, side’ is cognate with PSES
_*[garo]garo-_ ‘ribs, side’ below, then POc _*garo-_ can be reconstructed, but the available
evidence is not strong. The Maringe term is probably borrowed from a SES source.

There is a small set of terms in NGOc languages that displays formal similarities to the set
above, but it is unlikely that the two sets are cognate.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Lukep (Pono)         giri-gira-         ‘rib’
  NNG: Takia                giraŋe-            ‘side (of boat, rib cage, garden, mountain)’

  PT:  Dawawa               giri-giri          ‘ribs’

   Some languages distinguish between the (upper, shorter) ribs of the chest (Arosi
_rakerake-toʔo_, Wayan Fijian _-saro_) and the (lower, longer) ribs at the side and bottom of the rib cage
(Arosi _garogaro-_, Wayan Fijian _-sakesake_), and this distinction may have been present in POc.
In the Arosi term _rakerake-toʔo_ ‘upper rib cage’, _toʔo_ means ‘true’. That is, one side of the
upper rib cage is the ‘true _rakerake_’, whilst _rakerake-_ alone is the whole side of ribs. The
implication here is that _*[rage]rage-_ denoted a side of the upper rib cage, but was also used to
mean a whole side of the rib cage. However, this supposition requires confirmation with more
data.

    Two PPn terms are reconstructable, namely _*kaso-kaso_ ‘ribs, upper side’ and _*kao-kao_
‘ribs, flank, side (of a canoe), upper side of person’. Despite their formal similarity, the
evidence indicates two unrelated terms with very similar meanings. PPn _*kaso-kaso_ is almost
certainly derived from POc _*kaso_ ‘rafter’ (vol.1:53). If Mwotlap (NCV) _na-ɣaɣah_ ‘ribs’ is
cognate, then the term is of Proto Remote Oceanic antiquity.

3.5.7 Breast

POc _*susu-_ was polysemous, its meaning commonly extending to ‘milk’. The root _*susu_
evidently also formed a verb ‘suck (at the breast)’ (see §4.3.2.3), but _*susu-_ ‘breast’ was
formally distinct from it as it was a directly possessed noun, i.e. it took a possessor suffix.

3.5.8 Nipple

‘Nipple’ was denoted by a phrase that combined the terms for ‘eye’ and ‘breast’ with a linking
particle. Daughter languages display a variety of linkers, but in POc the linker was probably
_*qi_, as this was used with a directly possessed possessum (§3.1.1).

3.5.9 Belly

PAn _*tiaN_, ancestral to POc _*tia-_ ‘belly’, also provided the base for POc _*tian-an_ ‘pregnant’,
discussed in §4.2.2.3. This suggests that POc _*tia-_ referred principally to the external shape of
the belly. Terms for the corresponding internal organ, the stomach, are presented in §3.7.4.

   In the comparative literature reflexes of POc _*tia-_ are sometimes confused with those of
POc _*taqe-_ ‘faeces’ or POc _*tinaqe-_ ‘intestines’, but slight formal resemblance between _*tia-_
and the two latter terms is due to chance.

3.5.10 Navel, umbilical cord

Four reconstructions for ‘navel, umbilical cord’, apparently formally related, are candidates for
POc status: _*puso-_, _*piso-_, _*bʷito-_, _*buto-_. Although reasons for this proliferation of forms are
far from clear, we suggest that there were two POc forms, _*puso-_ (from PMP _*pusej_)
(§3.5.10.1) and _*bʷito-_ (§3.5.10.2), and that forms reflecting apparent _**piso-_ and _**buto-_[29] are
descended from _*puso-_ and _*bʷito-_ respectively. They are accounted for as follows:

__block__
A Because POc _*puso-_ and POc _*bʷito-_ were similar in form and meaning, contamination
  affected the vowel of the first syllable, so items reflecting apparent _**piso-_
  actually reflect _*puso-_ but with the vowel from _*bʷito-_.[30]
B The direct evidence for _*bʷ-_ of POc _*bʷito-_ is Drehet _pʷitie_, Tamambo _bʷito-_.
  However, _bʷ_ was an unstable phoneme. In some languages rounding was lost and
  _*bʷito-_ became _*bito-_; in others rounding spread to the following vowel, giving
  forms that seem to reflect _**buto-_.

To maintain clarity in the face of the complications here, each of the two reconstructions is
assigned its own subsection, and have listed forms that appear to reflect _**piso-_ and _**buto-_
separately from _*puso-_ and _*bʷito-_. A third subsection handles _**(b,bʷ)iso-_ and _**buso-_,
displaying a conflation that cannot be assigned unambiguously to either of the reconstructed
POc forms.

[29] A double asterisk (**) is used here for forms that appear to be reconstructable but which we explain here as
     due to post-POc changes.

[30] A more complicated explanation involving vowel dissimilation is also possible, but there is no other
     evidence for this in POc.

Lenakel _nəprəŋə_ ‘navel’, under _*buto-_ below, implies that POc _*bʷito-_ should be reconstructed
with final _*-ŋ_. In the absence of corroboratory evidence, we have not reconstructed the final
consonant, but note the possibility of doing so.

3.5.10.3 Conflated forms

Here are presented forms that appear to reflect a conflation of _*puso-_ and _*bʷito-_ and cannot be
readily assigned to either. Thus _**(b,bʷ)iso-_ and _**buso-_, the former with WOc reflexes only, take
_*(b,bʷ)-_ from _*bʷito-_ and _*-s-_ from _*puso-_.[31]

3.5.12 Buttocks

The reconstruction of a POc term for ‘buttocks’ encounters difficulties similar to those
discussed in association with the reconstruction of terms for ‘navel’ (§3.5.10). Three POc forms
are supported: _*bʷisi-_, _*(b,bʷ)oto-_ and *buru ‘buttocks’. The reconstructed forms begin with a
labial or labiovelar and have medial _*-s-_, _*-t-_ or _*-r-_. Unfortunately the data are insufficient to
tell a story that would unite any of the cognate sets below, but it is perhaps no coincidence that
POc _*bʷisi-_ ‘buttocks, anus’ was identical in form to POc _*bʷisi_ ‘fart’ (§4.3.7.3).

3.5.13.3 Female genitalia

POc _*puki-_ ‘vagina’ and PPn _*tole-_ ‘female genitalia’ can each be derived from a PMP term,
but in the case of _*tole-_ only if some phonological deformation is allowed in the derivation,
perhaps as a result of euphemism.

   Such deformation seems to underlie the three PMP forms reconstructed by Blust (ACD). If
PPn _*tole_ is indeed cognate with one of these, then it reflects yet another variant, PMP

   In Central Pacific languages a reflex of POc _*buku-_ ‘mound, knob, joint’ (§3.6.8.1.2;
vol.1:85, vol.2:50) is used to refer to the genital area (probably a metonym based on the mons

3.6    Limbs

Terms relating to the limbs are ordered as follows. First come terms associated with the arms
and hands, then terms associated with the legs and feet, and finally terms associated with both
pairs of limbs (finger/toe, finger-/toenail, elbow/knee and palm/sole).

3.6.1 Hand, arm

The monomorphemic POc terms listed below evidently referred to the hand and arm as one
unit, although some languages limit their reflex to the hand and lower arm (e.g. Iduna (PT)
_fowa-na nima-_ [scrotum-its arm-] ‘muscle of lower arm’), and POc _*[l,n]ima-_ may well have
had the more specific POc sense ‘forearm and hand’ as well as the larger sense ‘arm and hand’.
Monomorphemic terms for parts of the arm are much harder to find, but terms for ‘upper arm’
and ‘hand’ are reconstructed in §3.6.2.

   Reflexes of POc _*lima_ and _*nima_ ‘hand’ are numerous throughout the Austronesian world,
most referring at the same time to ‘five’.

   Reflexes of the Meso-Melanesian and Eastern Oceanic subgroups largely support _*l-_,
while those from the Admiralties support _*n-_. The NNG and PT subgroups show no clear
pattern. Either _*l-_ was sometimes nasalised to _n-_ before a nasal-initial syllable, or both forms
existed as doublets in POc.

   A second form, POc _*paRa_ ‘hand, arm’ is reconstructable, based on non-Oceanic cognates
together with cognates from Central Vanuatu. Blust (ACD) writes that it is possible that these
forms should be assigned to PMP _*[qa]baRa_ ‘shoulder’ with parallel semantic shifts that
create the illusion of an independent comparison, but he regards this hypothesis as unlikely.
We agree with him, as there are a number of reflexes of POc _*[qa]paRa_ ‘shoulder’ which lack
the first syllable, and all consistently denote ‘shoulder’. The gloss ‘arm, hand’ here suggests
that PMP _*baRa_/POc _*paRa_ was a distinct if nearly homophonous etymon.

   It is possible that PMP _*paRada_/POc _*paRara_ ‘handle of an axe or adze’ has played some
role in the history of this form. Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic reflexes are trisyllabic, but
Clark (2009) reconstructs PNCV _*vara_ ‘handle’. The disyllabic form may be the result of
contamination by _*vara_ ‘hand, arm’, and may in turn have led to the preservation of the latter.
But this is a speculation.

162 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross


   The use of reflexes of POc _*banic_ and _*kaba-_ for ‘arm’ in some daughter languages is an
extension of their core meaning ‘wing’ (vol.4:132–133, 275). We add ‘arm, hand’ to the
glosses of ‘wing’ reconstructions with a question mark, as it is possible that extensions of
meaning to ‘arm’ have occurred independently in daughter languages.

3.6.2 Parts of the arm

Terms for the elbow, the fingers and fingernails and the palm of the hand are discussed in
§3.6.8 together with the corresponding parts of the leg.

   Oceanic languages typically distinguish terminologically between the upper arm (from
shoulder to elbow), the forearm (from elbow to wrist), the wrist, and the hand, but the terms
referring to them are often compounds or phrases. There is some evidence, however, that POc
*nima/lima denoted in its more specific sense the forearm and hand, whilst early Oceanic
speakers also had single-word terms for the upper arm and for the hand.

3.6.3 Left hand and right hand

The three POc terms for ‘left-hand’, _*kauRi_, _*mawiRi_ and _*mauRi_, reflect a single PAn/PMP
root _*wiRi_ ‘left’. POc _*kauRi_ reflects PMP _*ka-wiRi_, where _*ka-_ formed a stative verb (‘be on
the left’). PMP _*ma-wiRi_ was the actor voice form of this verb, and is reflected in POc
_*mawiRi_ and its variant _*mauRi_. The POc forms _*mawiRi_ and _*mauRi_ are reconstructed
separately below, but it is quite likely that at least some of the forms listed under _*mauRi_ are
descended from _*mawiRi_, the sound change _*-wi-_ to _*-u-_ having occurred independently in
various languages.

   The pairs _*kawanan_/_*mawanan_ ‘right’ and _*kataqu_/_*mataqu_, also ‘right’, below, have
similar origins, but here the unaffixed roots _*wanan_ and _*taqu_ evidently also survived into
POc (Evans 2001:343).

   It is probable that at least the terms in _*ma-_ were also used as verbs in POc. Grammatical
information about their reflexes is hard to find, but Lichtenberk (2008) glosses To’aba’ita
(SES) _mauli_ as an intransitive verb ‘be on the left’, which is also used attributively (e.g.
_maa mauli nau_ [eye be.on.left I] ‘my left eye’). The attributive use of stative verbs is normal in
Oceanic languages (Ross 1998c). However, there is evidence that these terms also functioned
as nouns in phrasal constructions, as in Kwaio (SES) _gula i mooli_ [side LINKER left] ‘lefthand
side’ and Wayan Fijian _lima i matau_ [hand LINKER right] ‘right hand’. Both phrasal
expressions reflect the POc nonspecific possessor construction where the item after _*qi_ was a
noun (§3.1.1). For example, the Wayan example reflects POc _*lima qi mataqu_, lit. ‘hand on/
of/at right’.

   Note that in the glosses below, hyphenated ‘left-hand’ and ‘right-hand’ indicate that the
term appears to be an adjective or a stative verb.

3.6.4 Leg, foot

Proto Oceanic speakers evidently used a single term for the leg and foot.

   Blust (ACD) reconstructs both PAn _*qaqay_ and PAn _*waqay_, and the two forms are both
continued in Oceanic. POc _*waqe-_ is reflected in Fijian and Polynesian and _*qaqe-_ in
Admiralties, Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic languages. There are no reflexes in
Micronesia or Vanuatu. No language has reflexes of both forms.

3.6.5.2 Knee

Terms meaning both ‘knee’ and ‘elbow’ are presented in §3.6.8.1. Other terms, presented here,
appear originally to have meant ‘knee’, but are in some languages also applied to ‘elbow’.

   More than one POc term beginning with _*tu-_ is reconstructable with the meaning ‘knee’.
Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _*tur_. POc _*turu-_ is also attested. PWOc _*tuku-_ is reasonably
well attested. A number of NW Solomonic languages reflect _*tuŋu-_ (Banoni, Piva _cuŋu-_
‘knee’, Lungga, Nduke _tu-tuŋu_ ‘knee, elbow’, Vangunu, Roviana _tuŋu-tuŋu_ ‘knee, elbow’).

   The relationships among these forms are only partially understood. The histories of PWOc
_*tuku-_ and NW Solomonic _*tuŋu-_ are not known, but we can show how POc _*tur_ and _*turu-_
are related.

   The PAn form for ‘knee’ was _*tuduS_ (ACD). PAn _*S_ became PMP _*h_, and a regular
metathesis whereby PAn *-CV_S_ became PMP *-_h_VC gave rise to PMP _*tuhud_ ‘knee’. By
regular sound change this became POc _*tur_ (ACD), reflexes of which are shown below. Some
of these reflexes are reduplicated as a means of creating the preferred canonic form, a
disyllable, from monosyllabic _*tur_. The preferred strategy for creating a (suffixed) directly
possessed noun (§3.1.1) from a root with a final consonant was to replace the final consonant
with the suffix, as many reconstructions in this chapter illustrate, but in the case of
monosyllabic _*tur_, a supporting vowel was added instead, giving disyllabic _*turu-_, a change
which seems to have occurred at an earlier interstage than POc as Blust (ACD) reconstructs
_*turu-_ to PCEMP.[35]

[35] There were very few monosyllabic POc nouns, so we do not know whether this was a general POc
     strategy for creating disyllabic directly possessed nouns from monosyllabic roots. Blust (ACD) rejects
     (rightly, in our view) an alternative analysis whereby POc _*turu-_ continues PAn _*tuduS_ via PMP
     †_*tuduh_. His grounds are (i) that -CVS metathesis was regular and (ii) that PMP †_*tuduh_ is not reflected
     in western MP languages.

[36] Final _-t_ reflects Proto Huon Gulf _*-c_, a formative added to directly possessed nouns lacking a possessor
     (Ross 1988:144) which was apparently an irregular reflex of POc _*-ki_ (Ross 2001b).

Western Oceanic languages have a set of semantically related compounds for the calf. In some
languages the calf is ‘scrotum of leg’ or ‘testicle of leg’. In others ‘nut of leg’ is found, noting
that ‘nut’, ‘seed’ and ‘testicle’ are often glosses of the same term in Oceanic languages. In a
number of Papuan Tip languages it is ‘roe of leg’, where the term for ‘roe’ reflects POc _*biRa-_
(vol.4:129).

3.6.5.4 Heel

Blust reconstructs PMP _*tiked_ ‘heel’ (ACD), but no Oceanic reflexes have been found. Instead
there are compounds. In NW Melanesia, the usual expression appears to be ‘occiput of foot’,
using a reflex of POc _*k(i,e)ju-_/PNGOc _*g(i,e)ju-_ ‘back of head, occiput’ (§3.4.5). Of the
reflexes below, only Nakanai _kisu_ and Ubir _etu-_ are independently attested in the data with the
back of the head as denotatum, but there is little doubt that all the items listed are reflexes
thereof. In Tawala the reduplicated form, encoding ‘little occiput’, lacks a reflex of _*g(i,e)ju-_,
probably once present as it is in closely related Gumawana.

[37] Ramoaaina _talia_ ‘nut of Terminalia catappa’, reflecting POc _*talise_ (vol.3:324).

Takia speakers use the semantically corresponding expression _ŋie- buro-n_ [leg-X occiput-its].

   In at least some Oceanic languages the corresponding expression is ‘back of foot’, using
the relational local noun POc _*muri[-]_ ‘back part, rear, behind, space to the rear of, time after;
(canoe) stern; space outside’ (vol.2:251) or its variant _*buri-_ (vol.2:253).

3.6.6 Footprint

The addition of _*-kV_ to the Nyindrou, Manam and Mota reflexes of POc _*mʷale-_ ‘footprint’ is
unexplained, but the addition of _-ŋ(V)_ in the Neve’ei and Tape reflexes implies that _*mʷale-_
was at some point a verb, to which nominalising _*-ŋa_ was then added.

‘after foot’, with a reflex of _*muri-_ or _*buri-_ ‘back, be after’ (vol.2:311-312). Note that this
compound means ‘heel’ in some Oceanic languages (§3.6.5).

3.6.8 Parts common to arm/hand and leg/foot

Note that ‘armpit’ is treated as part of the trunk (§3.5.4).

3.6.8.1 Elbow and knee

This section has two parts to facilitate crossreferencing, particularly between the formally
similar pairs of terms in §3.4.2 and §3.6.8.1.1.

   POc also had terms that specifically denoted the knee. For these, see §3.6.5.2.

3.6.8.1.1 POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ ‘elbow, knee; joint, node’ and PSOc _*bʷau-_ ‘knee, joint’

The formal aspects of the two terms reconstructed here are discussed at length in §3.4.2.

   POc _*pʷatu[ka]-_ was evidently the general term for a knee or elbow joint, but not hip or
shoulder. The seemingly optional _*-ka-_ that is reflected in some members of the cognate set
remains unexplained,[39] unless, as mentioned in §3.4.2, _*pʷatu[ka]-_ originally meant ‘kneecap’
and is identical with putative _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’.

3.6.8.1.2 Other terms for joint, elbow and knee

Reflexes of POc _*buku_ ‘mound, knob, joint’ are also used in a number of Oceanic languages to
refer to the elbow and/or knee. However, it is clear that _*buku_ focussed on the shape of the
referent,[41] whereas the central meaning of the terms reconstructed in §3.6.8.1.1 was the knee or
elbow joint itself.

   As elbows are more corner-like than knees, POc _*s[i,u]ku_, reflecting a PMP term that also
meant ‘corner’, may have referred specifically to ‘elbow’.

[41] Thus POc _*buku_ is glossed ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood, string or rope’
     in vol.1:85; ‘mound, knob, joint’, possibly also ‘hill’ in vol.2:51; and its PCP reflex denotes ‘female
     genitals’ in §3.5.13.3.

3.6.8.2 Fingers and toes, finger- and toenails

Where data are from dictionaries rather than from wordlists, it is clear that the same term is
typically used in Oceanic languages for ‘fingernail’, ‘toenail’ and ‘claw (of quadruped or bird)’,
and this was presumably the case in POc too. However, wordlist sources tend to show a term
only for ‘fingernail’.

    POc _*kuku-_ apparently also denoted ‘finger’. Both non-Oceanic (ACD) and Oceanic
reflexes attest to this.

    The index finger (forefinger) in many Oceanic languages is denoted by a form that is
identical with or includes the verb ‘point’. Indeed, _*tusu-_ ‘forefinger’ is derived from a PMP
term meaning ‘point’. In the Papuan Tip area forefinger terms sometimes allude to the fact that
one dips the forefinger into food in order to taste it: Dawawa _buta-remo_ (_buta_ ‘salt’, _remo_
‘taste’), Tawala _habaya-lemu_ (_habaya_ ‘cooking pot’, _lemu_ ‘taste’). Terms for the other digits
are not reconstructable, but the thumb is ‘big digit’ in a number of languages: Misima
_gig-bʷaya_ (_gigi_ ‘finger, toe’, _bʷaya_ ‘big’), PNCV _*bisu-laba_ (_*bisu_ ‘finger’, _*laba_ ‘big’; Clark
2009), Wayan _kuku-levu_ (_levu_ ‘big’).

3.6.8.3 Palm of hand and sole of foot

PMP _*palaj_ ‘palm of hand, sole of foot’ is widely reflected in western Malayo-Polynesian
languages, but only a single Oceanic reflex occurs in the data. Most Oceanic languages support
POc _*lapʷar_.

   POc _*lapʷar_ ‘palm of hand, sole of foot’ appears superficially to reflect PAn _*da(m)paN_
‘palm of hand, sole of foot’,[42] but the latter would give rise to POc †_*ra(p,b)an_, so this is
probably a chance resemblance.

   Neither of these reconstructions has reflexes in Eastern Oceanic. The most common term
in Eastern Oceanic, found also in the Admiralties, is a compound meaning ‘face of hand/foot’,
containing a reflex of POc _*qarop_ ‘front, face’ (vol.2:247) plus the term for hand or foot,
contrasting with ‘back of hand/foot’ for the back of the hand and top of the foot (§3.6.8.4).

3.6.8.4 Back of hand and top of foot

The top of the foot was apparently the ‘back of foot’ in POc, as it is in geographically distant
modern languages. This seems odd in European thinking, until it is recognised that Oceanic
speakers view feet and hands analogously: the palm of the hand and sole of the foot are
perceived as ‘face, front’ (§3.6.8.3), the back of the hand and top of the foot as ‘back’.

[42] PAn _*dapaN_ is reconstructed on the basis of (Formosan) Tsou _caphə_ ‘foot’, Saaroa _sapale_ ‘foot’,
Thao _sapað_ ‘sole, footprint’, Pazih _sa-sapal_ ‘sole’ and (Philippine) Ilokano, Bikol, Pangasinan _dapan_
     ‘sole’ (among other reflexes).

Note that this term was distinct from POc _*[m,b]uri (w,q)aqe_ ‘heel’ (§3.6.5.2) (lit. ‘back of
foot’). POc _*[m,b]uri_ was a relational local noun denoting the back of something (§3.1.2), but
the terms for ‘back’ in ‘top of foot’ phrases denote a person’s back.


3.7      Internal organs

3.7.1 Internal organs in general

The internal organs are listed here roughly in order from the top of the trunk to the bottom.
There is a certain amount of evidence that POc _*qate-_ ‘liver’, regarded as the seat of the
emotions and the centre of one’s being (§3.7.6), also served as a collective term for the internal
organs. This is clear in terms from Nakanai (MM), where the liver itself is specified by adding
a modifier (_kuru_) to the more general term _hate-_, reflecting POc _*qate-_.

__formgroup__
 MM: Nakanai  hate-              ‘liver or solar plexus (seat of emotion); internal organs in general; sometimes spleen’
 MM: Nakanai  |la hate kuru|     ‘liver’ (_kuru_ ‘dark-coloured’)

The terms below reveal a similar pattern: the reflex of _*qate-_ denotes the internal organs, and
various modifiers indicate the specific organ (see also the terms for ‘lungs’ in §3.7.3).

3.7.2 Heart

Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _*buaq_ ‘areca nut and palm; heart’. The only reflex listed in the
ACD with the meaning ‘heart’ is Tolai _buai-_, which is in fact a reflex of PWOc _*busa(q)_ ‘heart’,
as _-s-_ is lost in Tolai. However, Vitu, Bola and Nakanai have _bua-_ ‘heart’, and these are regular
reflexes of POc _*buaq_, not of _*busa(q)_.

similar in form (and _*busa(q)_ is similar to _*buaq_ above), and there is no semantic difference
between them. The reflexes of both mean ‘heart’ with an occasional instance of ‘liver’. This is
presumably an outcome of the fact that both the heart and the liver are regarded as seats of the
emotions by speakers of various Oceanic languages. Where similar forms occur with similar
meanings, there may be contamination of one by the other, and Wogeo _buso-_ and Malai
_pus-pusa-_ both seem to illustrate this.

   No convincing explanation can be offered for the fact that there are two terms, but note (i)
that POc _*puso-_ is also one of the forms reconstructed for ‘navel’ (§3.5.10) and (ii) that POc
_*puco(q)_[44] and POc _*busa_ are both terms for ‘foam’ (vol.2:96–97) and that each has a PMP
antecedent. Whilst it is easier to explain (i) as a semantic shift, it is more difficult to explain
away (ii), the fact that the same two forms occur for both ‘foam’ and ‘heart’. One of the
reconstructed terms for ‘lungs’ (§3.7.3) includes a word meaning ‘foam’ and, as the heart and
lungs are in close relationship anatomically, it may be that an early meaning shift has occurred
here.

3.7.3 Lungs

Three reconstructions for ‘lungs’ are offered below. The first of these is technically unusual in
that two possible pre-Oceanic source etyma can be posited, PAn _*baRaq_ ‘lung’ and PMP _*para_
‘coconut embryo’, and therefore two alternative POc forms, _*paRa(q)_ ‘lung’ and _*paraq_
‘spongy mass…’. At first sight it seems obvious to propose that PAn _*baRaq_ ‘lung’ is ancestral
to this cognate set below. However, the Micronesian reflexes listed below are interpreted by
Bender et al. (2003) as containing a reflex PMic _*fara_ ‘core (of breadfruit, coconut,
pandanus)’, which reflects POc _*paraq_ ‘spongy mass inside sprouting coconut;
brain’ (vol.3:373). The Micronesian reflexes other than Marshallese have an additional element,
and it is reasonable to infer that this reflects POc _*uRat_/PMic _*ua_ ‘veins, arteries, tendons’,
reflecting a possible (but not firmly reconstructable) POc _*paraq qi uRat_, meaning
approximately ‘spongy mass of innards’, i.e. ‘lungs’. This does not mean that PAn _*baRaq_
‘lung’ has played no role in the derivation of Oceanic forms, but that at least in a number of
early Oceanic languages POc _*paRa(q)_ and _*paraq_ were conflated.[45]

[45] There is no non-Oceanic evidence for the final _*-q_ of POc _*paraq_ ‘spongy mass…’, and its apparent
     presence may be the result of conflations with _*paRa(q)_ ‘lung’.

                                                                        The human body 183



    Reflexes of PAn _*baRaq_/PMP _*para_ are found only in languages of Vanuatu and
Micronesia. Its place has often been taken elsewhere in Oceanic by compound expressions.
Two of these can be reconstructed to POc, both compounds including reflexes of _*qate-_
‘liver’ (§3.7.6), which was apparently also used collectively to denote the major organs. The
literal meaning of the first compound was ‘frothy liver’. Its second element was a reduplicated
version of _*busaq_ or _*puco(q)_ ‘froth, foam’ (cf §3.7.2, and see footnote 44, p181). The
reduplication formed an adjective (vol.2:206) ‘frothy’, referring to the appearance of the lungs
when an animal is butchered. In several of the languages in the next set, the second element on
its own has come to refer to ‘lungs’.

Araki (NCV) uses a similar, albeit non-cognate, metaphor, _mavusa salesale_, literally ‘innards/
heart light in weight’ to refer to lungs.

3.7.4 Stomach

POc speakers probably made a terminological distinction between the stomach, i.e. the internal
organ that they found when they butchered a pig, and the belly, i.e. a part of the body as viewed
from outside. Terms for stomach are presented here, and terms for belly in §3.5.9.

    POc _*tobʷa_ has reflexes meaning ‘stomach’ across all major subgroups other than NNG,
MM and Pn. In some languages it also refers to a bag or basket, and this appears to have been
its primary meaning,[46] allowing derivation of the senses ‘bay’ and ‘area of sea enclosed by
barrier reef’ (landscape features that depend on some other feature of the ‘bag’ metaphor;
vol.2:46) and ‘stomach’, which appears bag-like when an animal is butchered. Reflexes with
all these meanings are listed below. The Malakula reflexes under ‘cf. also’ point to a form
_*tobʷa(k,q)a-_, but we do not yet understand whether such reflexes are conservative or innovatory.

    PCP _*kete_ ‘abdomen’ evidently reflects the same metaphor applied to a different form, as it
reflects Proto Remote Oceanic _*kete_ ‘basket’ (vol.1:78).

    POc _*bʷal(o,a)-_ is the most widely reflected term for ‘belly’ in MM and NCV, but in many
languages its reflex is used as a relational local noun, ‘inside’ (§3.1.2 and vol.2:239), implying
that its main referent was the internal organ. This interpretation is supported by the fact that it
sometimes appeared as the first element in compounds referring to ‘intestines’. In South New
Ireland languages it is also used in what was perhaps originally a colloquial term ‘carry
stomach’ for ‘be pregnant, carry a child’.

    The principal PPn term for the stomach was _*manawa_ ‘belly, stomach’, reflecting POc
_*[ma]ñawa_ (V) ‘breathe, rest, be alive’; (N) ‘breath, life, fontanelle’. The history of terms
descended from POc _*[ma]ñawa_ is complex and is discussed with a fuller set of reflexes in
§4.5.1. We speculate that the semantic shift that gave rise to the meaning ‘belly, stomach’ may
have first followed a path suggested by Blust (ACD): ‘…from the notion “breath; to breathe”
there is a link to the “breath soul”, and from this to “soul; inner self, mind, feelings”…’. As the
stomach is regarded as the seat of the emotions in some Oceanic cultures, it is only a short step
from here to ‘stomach’. Nonetheless, the evidence amassed in ch.9 indicates that _*[ma]ñawa_
did not occur in POc body-part metaphors denoting emotions, and that the changes that led to
the meaning ‘belly, stomach’ occurred long after the break-up of POc. Three non-Polynesian
reflexes with a meaning relating to the stomach are listed under ‘cf. also’. We take the Kiribati
term to reflect Polynesian influence and the Papuan Tip terms to reflect a localised innovation
that happens to be similar to Polynesian.

3.7.5 Intestines

A number of reflexes of the terms reconstructed for belly or stomach in §3.7.4 are glossed
‘intestines’ or ‘guts’. In some instances it is obvious that the term so glossed is a compound that
includes a word for belly or stomach, but others may be the result of inadequate data collection.
The same is true of terms in this section. It is not easy to identify the internal organs unless one
has a butchered animal to refer to.

    The most widely reflected POc etymon for intestines is _*tinaqe_, derived from a PAn
nominalisation formed by infixing _*<in>_ into PAn _*Caqi_ ‘faeces’.[48] Its reflexes have become
relational local nouns in a few languages (§3.1.2 and vol.2:239).

[48] If _*<in>_ was a nominaliser, then _*Caqi_ would also be expected to have served as a verb (‘defecate’), but there
      is no evidence of this.

   Blust (ACD) reconstructs PWMP _*isaw_ and suggests that it may have referred exclusively
to animal intestines. The Oceanic evidence suggests a more general gloss ‘innards, guts’ for
POc _*iso-_. Some of its Polynesian reflexes include the senses ‘umbilical cord’ and ‘pith’,
suggesting semantic contamination by the formally somewhat similar _*puso-_ ‘navel, umbilical
cord’ (§3.5.10.1) and/or POc _*quto-_ ‘brain, pith, marrow’ (vol.3:374–375).

3.7.6 Liver

The liver was evidently regarded by Proto Oceanic speakers as the centre of one’s being, the
place in which feelings, emotions, desires, understanding, and knowledge were located (see the
discussion in §9.2.1 of terms for emotions that refer to the liver). In terms of physical body
parts, although POc *qate evidently refers primarily to ‘liver’, its meaning is frequently
broadened in daughter languages to include other internal organs: ‘heart’, ‘chest’ and, less
commonly, ‘lungs’ and ‘spleen’ (§3.7.1).

[49] He writes, ‘Since PMP _*qalejaw_ ‘day’ apparently has become POc _*qajo_ …, it is conceivable that a parallel
  change in PAn _*qapeju_ ‘gall, gall bladder’ could have given rise to the forms cited here. … [T]his hypothesis
  fails to explain why languages such as Bipi, Lindrou, Likum, Papitalai, Pak, Penchal, and Nauna, which
  distinguish PAn/POc _*s_ from _*j_, point to POc _*s_ as the medial consonant in this form. PAn _*qapeju_ and POc
  _*qasu_ thus appear to have no historical connection.’

3.7.8 Spleen

The spleen is a significant organ in many Oceanic communities because malaria may lead to its
enlargement, leading on occasion to its fatal rupture. Some languages have a word with a
meaning relating to an enlarged spleen, e.g. Titan (Adm) map ‘condition of having an enlarged
spleen’ (N), Iduna (PT) _kʷada_ ‘enlarged spleen’, Gela (SES) _bila_ ‘enlarged spleen’.

    Although not widely attested in the data, there is sufficient representation across subgroups
to attribute _*bila-_ ‘spleen’ to POc.

<

 NNG: Lukep                 wila-              ‘spleen’
 MM: Teop                   bina-              ‘spleen’
 SES: Gela                  bila-              ‘big belly, enlarged spleen’
>

    Two metaphoric expressions for ‘spleen’ have been reconstructed for PPn: _*qate-loa_ (‘long
liver’) and _*qate-pili_ (‘sticky liver’). Bauan Fijian _yate balavu_ echoes the former, with a
non-cognate term for ‘long’.

  Pn:    Tokelauan         ate-pili            ‘spleen’
>

3.7.9 Kidney

A term for ‘kidney’ cannot be reconstructed with any certainty. In many Oceanic languages the
term for kidney is a metaphor that makes reference to an object that is perceived as kidney-
shaped, typically a fruit or nut, or is preceded by a classifier for such objects. For instance,
reflexes of POc _*puaq_ ‘fruit’ occur in Adm, SES, NCV and Pn terms.

    The most frequent metaphor equates a kidney with a Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer),
and this points to a possible reconstruction. One POc term for the Tahitian chestnut was _*ipi_
(vol.3:318) and a very few languages reflect this or a reduplicated form _*ip(i)-ipi_ in the sense
of kidney.

A Tolai (MM) term is _ela_ ‘chestnut tree; the kidneys’. In this instance it is not clear which was
the original meaning.

   Reflexes of POc _*giri-giri_ ‘coral, coral rubble’ (vol.2:64) have in places varied their
meaning to ‘pebble’ and thence to pebble-shaped objects like kidneys (Paul Geraghty, pers.
comm.). Thus we find:

3.7.11 Uterus, placenta and amniotic fluid

No POc term is reconstructable for the uterus, but it is noteworthy that in scattered languages
the term for ‘stomach’ is used, sometimes with a qualifier, e.g. ‘stomach of child’.

   There is, however, a term for the placenta, POc _*tapuni-_. The loss of _-n-_ or _-ni-_ in a
majority of reflexes may reflect reanalysis of _-ni_ as a verbal transitive suffix. Robert Blust
(pers. comm.) suggests that the practice of burying the placenta described in the Kwaio gloss
prepares the way for the extension of meaning to the transitive verb ‘bury, conceal’ reflected in
Arosi, leading to the resultant deletion of transitivising _-ni_ from the noun form.

   Terms for amniotic fluid are few and far between in the data sources, but those that occur
have to do with ‘water’. Gela _mbeimbeti_ ‘amniotic fluid’ is a reduplicated form of _mbeti_ ‘fresh
water’. The only reconstruction for ‘amniotic fluid’ is PPn _*lanu_, which is a reflex of POc
_*[dr,r]anum_ ‘fresh water’ and also meant ‘bathe or wash in fresh water’ (POLLEX).

[51] The unetymological _ʔ-_ here perhaps results from a transcription error.

3.8       Bodily emissions

This topic of this section is substances that are emitted by the body (as opposed to those of
which the body is composed; §3.3). They are listed in the same order as the body parts in
§§3.4–3.5 with which their emission is associated, that is, roughly in order from the top of the
trunk to the bottom. Verbs associated with bodily emissions are presented in §4.4.

   The POc term for pus is presented in §5.3.2.2 in association with terms that have to do with
health and sickness. A multiplicity of terms for the action of spitting and for spittle are
included in §4.4.3. They are there rather than here because the terms for saliva/spittle appear
to be derived from verbs of spitting. However, a possible compound for ‘saliva’ is mentioned
in §3.8.4. Similarly the POc term for ‘sweat’ (both verb and noun) was originally a verb
(_*ma-qono_) and is also to be found in §4.4.6. Terms for ‘urine’ and ‘urinate’ also employ the same
roots and are located in §4.4.7.

3.8.1 Tears

Terms for ‘tears’ are typically compounds, as in PEOc _*suRu qi mata_ ‘tears’, literally ‘fluid of
eye’ or Proto Remote Oceanic _*wai(R) ni mata_, literally ‘water of eye’, in which the first item denotes a fluid[52]
and the second reflects POc _*mata_ ‘eye’ (§3.4.9.1). Because the ‘fluid’ item has been replaced
at various times, some members of the cognate sets below may be outcomes of independent
replacement. Thus PPn _*lo-qi-mata_ ‘tears’ is well attested, suggesting that Hawaiian _wai maka_
and Marquesan _vai-mata_ may reflect local innovations independent of Proto Remote Oceanic
_*wai(R) ni mata_.

3.8.2 Earwax and deafness

The association between earwax and deafness in the glosses of POc _*tul(i,e)_ below is an
obvious one, but the cognate set raises the question, What did POc _*tul(i,e)_ mean? ‘Earwax’ or
‘deaf’ or both?[53] A key to the answer lies in the fact that ‘he is deaf’ is usually expressed in the
Oceanic languages of New Guinea and the Bismarcks as ‘his ears are deaf/blocked/closed’, i.e.
by an expression in which ‘ears’ is the subject. In Dobu and Muyuw, at least, reflexes of
_*tul(i,e)_ are also the predicate of such a construction, i.e. ‘his ears are earwaxed’. Thus if
_*tul(i,e)_ was used as a noun, it meant ‘earwax’ (and perhaps ‘deafness’); if it was used as a verb
with ‘ears’ as subject, then it meant ‘be deaf’. In PPn the sense ‘deaf’ was retained and ‘earwax’
became _*taqe-tuli_ ‘excrement of deafness’. Samoan has a compound verb _faʔa-taliŋa-tuli_ ‘turn
a deaf ear’ [lit. ‘cause ear deaf’].

[53] Blust (ACD) asks the same question with regard to PMP _*tuli_. Because there are other terms for ‘deaf’
     but nor for ‘earwax’, he concludes that it meant the latter, and that an extension to ‘deaf’ has happened
     more than once at various times and places.

198 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross

3.8.3 Snot, nasal mucus


[54] Although Blust (ACD) glosses these POc reconstructions as shown here, he labels them as doublets, implying
     that they are alternant forms with the same meaning, i.e. both ‘earwax’ and ‘deaf’.

                                                                        The human body 199


Three POc terms for ‘snot’ are reconstructed. It seems probable that POc _*ŋorok_ ‘snot’ is
historically the same root as _*ŋorok_ ‘grunt, growl, snore’ (§4.5.3) and the root of
POc _*ŋoro-ŋorok_ ‘channel above upper lip’ (§3.4.11), the more so as the visible manifestation of snot is
above the upper lip of small children. Wayan Fijian distinguishes three kinds of mucus: _drove_
‘phlegm, thick mucus in the throat or lungs’, a reflex of POc _*(dr,d)ap(e,i)_ below; _dakwa_ ‘snot’;
and _drakwa_ ‘white mucus secreted by the eye’, but it is impossible to provide more specific

3.8.4 Saliva

Most terms for ‘saliva’ appear specifically to denote spittle, and are found in §4.4.3, as they are
identical with or derived from a verb meaning ‘spit’. However, it is possible that POc speakers
labelled saliva ‘water of mouth’, as this expression is found at widespread locations. It is,
however, such an obvious compound that it may have arisen independently at different times
and places.

3.8.5 Semen, smegma

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _*biRas_ or _*biRaq_ ‘semen, smegma’, both resulting in POc
_*biRa_, but each rests on a single non-Oceanic reflex[55] plus the Oceanic reflexes below whose
meanings most consistently denote stale or unwanted material such as sediment left after
processing. No Oceanic reflex denotes ‘semen’, but Polynesian reflexes include reference to
smegma (penile mucus) and vaginal mucus, suggesting that these were among its POc
denotations.

    Euphemistic labels for semen seem to be quite common, and PCP _*sī_ perhaps originated in
this way.

[55] PMP _*biRas_ rests on Sangir _bihaseʔ_ ‘semen, smegma, vaginal fluid’, _*biRaq_ on
Maranao _bigaʔ_ ‘semen, sperm, egg’.

NCV languages use reflexes of POc _*suRuq_ ‘juice, fluid’ to refer to a range of bodily fluids
including variously snot, tears and semen: (Avava _a-sur_ ‘semen’, Raga _hu-_ ‘oil, liquid, juice,
semen’). Some languages refer to semen euphemistically as ‘his water’, e.g. Nyindrou (Adm)
_gʷa ta-n_ [water PREP-his], ’Are’are (SES) _wai-na_ [water-his]. Other euphemisms include
Lukep (NNG) _gorenge_ (from POc _*g(o.u)reŋ_ ‘coconut milk, coconut cream’; vol.3:372),
Kwaio _bula-bula-_ ‘saliva’ and Lonwolwol (NCV) _atu-_ ‘seed’

3.8.6 Faeces, excrement

Two terms are reconstructed. POc _*taqe-_ ‘faeces’ was primarily a noun. POc _*pekas_ was a
verb, ‘defecate’, but seems also to have been used as a noun meaning ‘faeces’. The cognate set
reflecting _*pekas_ is given in §4.4.8.

   It is not clear what the meaning difference between _*[qa]nunu_ and _*qata(r)_ may have
been, but it is possible that the basic sense of the former was ‘shadow’, of the latter ’image’ or
‘soul’.

3.9.2 Name

Oceanic terms for ‘name’ are also usually directly possessed. Two similar POc forms,
_*[q]aca(n,ŋ)_/_*[q]aca-_ and _*i(s,c)aŋ_/_*i(s,c)a-_, are reconstructable. To our knowledge, no
language has reflexes of both, but quite commonly where one language reflects _*[q]aca(n,ŋ)_,
its close relative reflects _*i(s,c)aŋ_ (e.g. Tuam vs Malai, Suau vs Kakabai, Tigak vs Tolai,
Mwotlap vs Araki). We have no explanation for this.

206 Meredith Osmond and Malcolm Ross

   Reconstructing the initial consonant of POc _*[q]aca[n,ŋ]_ ‘name’ has proved problematic.
The PMP form was evidently _*[ŋ]ajan_, with the loss of initial _*ŋ-_ occurring prior to POc.
Proto Eastern Admiralties reflexes actually reflect PEAd _*nq-_, and reflexes of ‘name’ have the
same initials as other _*nq_-initial items. Evidence that _*q-_ is not an Admiralties innovation,
however, lies with Apalik _kasaŋ_. John Lynch adds that evidence from Tanna languages
suggests that _*q_ was ancestral to these forms too (pers. comm. and see also Lynch 2001c:120).

4              Bodily conditions and activities

4.1    Introduction

This chapter is complementary to chapter 3 on the human body. Whereas the latter is devoted to
the nouns that label the parts of the body, the present chapter is dedicated to events and states
that are associated with the body’s natural processes. Events in this context include both
processes that occur spontaneously (sweating, breathing, snoring) and deliberate activities like
eating, drinking and copulating. In between these two extremes are numerous events the
agentivity of which is open to question: sleeping, belching, yawning, defecating, laughing,
crying and so on.

    The chapter begins with events and states relating to life, death and reproduction (§2).
These are followed by events and states that have to do with eating, drinking and the digestive
organs (§3). Then follow events concerned with the emission or elimination of bodily
substances (§4), with breathing and the respiratory organs (§5), with sleeping and waking
(§6), with physical responses to emotion, pain or cold (§7), and with body temperature (§8). A
separate chapter, ch.5, deals with terms relating to sickness and health. The line drawn
between this chapter and ch.5 is at times somewhat arbitrary. Terms denoting itching,
dizziness and pain are handled in ch.5.

    One might think because the subject matter of this chapter deals with aspects of the life of
all human beings, culture would impinge less here that in other areas of the lexicon. Perhaps
this is true, but there are a surprising number of points in this chapter where culture, broadly
conceived, is encapsulated in lexical choices. Although there was a general POc term for
drinking, drinking was also subdivided into two different physical acts (§3.2.1). One was
pouring liquid down the throat without the vessel touching the lips, a practice which probably
has its roots in drinking coconut water from a small hole in the shell. The other was sipping
and slurping liquid directly from a vessel. Similarly, chewing and sucking also each
constituted more than one activity, depending on what was chewed (§3.1.2) or what was
sucked on (§3.2.2–3). Certain sucking noises served as signals of refusal or attention-getting
(§§3.6.1–2), whilst kissing appears to have lacked a distinct label. In Central Pacific languages
what other languages commonly conceive as the states of being hungry, thirsty and sleepy are
commonly conceived as desires: ‘want to eat’ (§3.3.1), ‘want to drink’ (§3.3.2) and ‘want to
sleep’ (§6.2.1).

4.2     Living, dying, reproducing and growing

4.2.1 Living, dying and being healthy

The principal POc verbs for ‘be alive’ and ‘die, be dead’ have an interesting and complementary
range of meanings. The verb _*maqurip_ is glossed ‘be alive, live, flourish; be in good
health, recover health’, whilst _*mate_ is glossed ‘be dead, die; be unconscious, numb, paralysed,
lose consciousness; die, of fire or light’. These ranges of meaning are continued in many
modern Oceanic languages.

    Like many verbs denoting states, both these verbs and their reflexes may also be used
inchoatively, i.e. of coming to be in a state (§1.3.5.1). This explains why _*maqurip_ and many
of its reflexes mean both ‘be in good health’ and ‘recover health’, and why _*mate_ and many of
its reflexes mean both ‘be dead’ and ‘die’, as well as ‘be unconscious’ and ‘faint, become
unconscious’.

    The semantically interesting feature of these two verbs is that they were used not only to
denote living and dying, but that they were also used of a person’s state of health or
consciousness. Someone in good health or recovering their health was labelled _*maqurip_
‘alive’ or ‘coming alive’. Someone unconscious or fainting was labelled _*mate_ ‘dead’ or
‘dying’.


4.2.1.1 Being alive

Two POc intransitive verbs had the meaning ‘be alive’. One, POc _*mañawa_ ‘breath, breathe,
be alive; fontanel; rest’ evidently had the central meaning ‘breathe’ and is presented with a
detailed discussion in §5.1. The other, _*maqurip_ had the central meaning ‘be alive’ but, as
mentioned above, it inherited a wider set of meanings from PMP _*qudip_ which Blust (ACD)
describes as ‘a dominance of vitality as manifested in growth, flourishing, and being healthy,
fresh (of plants), or green (of plants, wood)’.

   The coexistence of PPn _*maquri_ ‘live, alive’ continuing POc _*maqurip_ above and PPn
_*ola_ ‘be alive, well, healthy; recover from illness’ poses a semantic question. Why would two
PPn terms coexist for what is apparently the same concept? The answer may be found in the
comparison of Wayan Fijian _ðola_ with PPn _*sola_ ‘flee, escape danger’. The Wayan gloss
reads (1) ‘be alive, living, live’; (2) ‘survive, escape danger’; (3) ‘recover from illness’; (4) ‘be
healthy, well’; (5) ‘(of living things) grow, thrive, flourish’. Meaning 2, ‘survive, escape
danger’, accords with PPn _*sola_ whose reflexes consistently mean ‘flee’. What Wayan
includes within one term PPn evidently separated into _*sola_ ‘flee, escape danger’ and _*ola_ ‘be
alive, well, healthy, recover from illness’, with almost no overlap of meaning.

    Many Polynesian languages retain reflexes of both POc _*maqurip_ and PPn _*ola_. Each
Polynesian language distinguishes the two terms by various subtleties of meaning. Eastern
Polynesian languages tend to use reflexes of _*maqurip_ to denote matters of the spirit and
consciousness while _*ola_ reflexes are concerned more with physical health.

4.2.1.2 Dying and being dead

Reflexes of PAn _*ma-aCay_, PMP _*m-atay_ ‘die, dead’ have from very early times carried a
number of extended meanings. POc _*mate_ evidently included among its meanings ‘be
unconscious, numb, paralysed’, as noted in §4.2.1, and if reduplicated, ‘be weak or ill’.[1] But
there were further extensions in meaning, some of them apparently already present in POc. The
tabulation below presents an analysis of the meanings of verbal reflexes of POc _*mate_ in
Mangap (NNG) _-mēte_, Gela (SES) _mate_, To’aba’ita (SES) _mae_ and Wayan Fijian _mate_ as they
are given in dictionaries of these languages (Bugenhagen & Bugenhagen 2007b, Fox 1955,
Lichtenberk 2008, Pawley & Sayaba 2003).

[1] This reduplicated usage appears to reflect lexicalisation of reduplication that in POc encoded and in
    many Oceanic languages encodes the imperfective aspect.

The extensions of meaning shown above vary somewhat across the four languages, but we
suspect that the differences are not as great as they appear from the tabulation, i.e. that some
senses have been omitted from the dictionary glosses. The tabulation suggests that ‘be[come]
paralysed (of a body-part)’, ‘die down, be[come] calm (of storm, wind or sea)’ and ‘go out (of
fire)’ are senses that were present in POc, and the glosses of reflexes in the cognate set below
indicate that ‘be[come] unconscious’, and ‘be[come] numb’ should be added to these. As the
glosses of a number of reflexes below indicate, POc _*mate_ apparently also participated in a
metaphor parallel to English ‘to die for’, i.e. ‘to desire strongly’ (see §11.5). Note that
‘be[come]’ in these glosses reflects the typical situation in Oceanic languages whereby the
aspect marker(s) that accompany a verb denoting a property indicate(s) whether it is to be taken
statively or inchoatively.

    Omitted from the table are a nominal sense of To’aba’ita _mae_, namely ‘k.o. evil spirit in the
bush, used by its possessor to kill people’ and nominal senses of Wayan Fijian _mate_: ‘death’,
‘paralysis’, ‘failure to work, malfunction’ and ‘sickness, disease, ailment’. The latter simply
reflect a zero nominalisation strategy. Their correspondents in Mangap and To’aba’ita are
formed with nominalising suffixes.

4.2.2 Reproducing

4.2.2.1   Copulating

Two terms are reconstructed for sexual intercourse, POc _*qait_, _*qait-i-_ and PEOc _*pai(s)_,
_*pais-i-_.

   The first of these appears to continue PMP _*ayu[t,d]_, which Blust (ACD) reconstructs to
PWMP because he lacks Oceanic reflexes. If POc _*qait_ does represent a continuation, albeit
with irregular prepended _*q-_, then _*ayu[t,d]_ is promoted to PMP. POLLEX attributes the
Polynesian reflexes of this etymon to POc _*saqit_ (PPn _*haqi_), but the initial sound
correspondences reflect PPn _*q-_, not _*h-_. Kwaio _l-_ and Bauan Fijian _ð-_ ultimately reflect
accretion of _*[y]_ before initial _*a-_ after loss of _*q-_ (Lichtenberk 1988, Geraghty 1983).

   Two POc forms are reconstructable: intransitive _*qait_ ‘copulate’, with a non-singular
subject, and transitive _*qait-i-_ ‘have sexual intercourse with s.o.’ , with a singular subject.

The reciprocal forms in the set below reflect the addition of reflexes of POc _*paRi-_ RECIP to
_*qai(t)_/_*qait-i-_ ‘have sexual intercourse (with s.o.)’. The reflexes are few enough to suggest
that these are local formations, and that the POc form is not necessarily reconstructable. Indeed,
as reciprocals with _*paRi-_ were typically intransitive, only the Tawala form, reflecting POc
intransitive _*qait_, appears to be a direct descendant of the likely POc form _*paRi-qait_. The
Samoic–Outlier forms all reflect loss of _*-a-_, i.e. _*fe-qiti_ for expected †_*fe-qaiti_.

    The following PMP reconstructions by Blust (ACD) have respectively one and two known
Oceanic reflexes. PMP _*duluR_ was perhaps already a euphemism for copulation, as Blust
(ACD) records Cebuano (C Philippines) dulug ‘sleep with someone’. Note, however, that the
initial consonants do not correspond: the expected POc root is †_*ruluR_ or _*druluR_.

4.2.2.2 Sexual desire

No term can be reconstructed here, but a number of languages use their term for
‘itchy’ (§5.3.2.4), either alone or in a body-part metaphor (ch.9) to mean ‘sexually excited’.

__formgroup__

  Pn:  Hawaiian             maneʔo          ‘itch, itchy; ticklish; sexually titilated’


4.2.2.3 Being pregnant

POc _*tian-an_ ‘pregnant’ is derived from PAn _*tiaN_ ‘belly’, which also gave rise to POc _*tia-_
‘belly’ (§3.5.9). It is rather easy to mistake a reflex of _*tian-an_ for a reflex of _*tia-_. For
example, Loniu _tiyan_ is a reflex of POc _*tian-an_ ‘pregnant’, not of POc _*tia-_ ‘belly’, as POc
final *-VC is normally lost in Admiralties languages.

   It is possible that some reflexes of POc _*tian-an_ have been conflated with a reflex of POc
_*tina-ña_ ‘his/her mother; big, biggest’, discussed in vol.2:195, and as a result have lost the first
_*-a-_. A pregnant woman is naturally described as a woman with a large belly (e.g. Nyindrou
[Adm] _drine-n i tinan_ [belly-her go big] ‘her belly is getting big; she is pregnant’), and, for
example, Siar _tinan_ ‘pregnant’ has the form that is expected of a reflex of _*tina-ña_ rather than
of _*tian-an_.

Nominalised forms carry a range of associated meanings:

__formgroup__
    Pn:     Samoan              fanau-ŋa             ‘delivery, childbirth, labour’
    Pn:     Tikopia             fanau-ŋa             ‘family; food for rite over new-born first child’
    Pn:     Maori               ɸānau-ŋa            ‘kinsman, relation’
    Pn:     Hawaiian            hanau-na             ‘generation, ancestry, birth; relation’

   The two following reconstructions, _*pasu[su]_ ‘(mother) give birth’ and _*pusa_ ‘(baby) be
born’ raise a number of questions. If metathesis was ever involved in assumed forms _*pasu_
and _*pusa_, evidence from Gela and Bugotu shows that there is now clear separation of form
and meaning.

   The form of _*pasu[su]_ suggests that it reflects _*pa-susu_, i.e. causative prefix + ‘suck’. POc
_*susu_ meant ‘suck’[2] (§4.3.2.3) and _*pa-susu_ meant ‘suckle, feed (baby) at the breast’, i.e.
‘cause to suck’. Two questions arise:

__block__
A. Does _*pasu[su]_ reflect _*pa-susu_, derived from the latter by metonymy?
B. If yes, were _*pasu[su]_ ‘give birth’ and _*pa-susu_ ‘suckle’ a single verb in POc?

    There are two sets of evidence, and they are in conflict. First, reflexes of _*pa-susu_ ‘suckle’
in §4.3.2.3 all reflect the disyllabic root _*-susu_, whereas several reflexes of _*pasu[su]_ ‘give
birth’ do not reflect the disyllabic root and instead reflect POc _*pasu_. What is more, in several
languages (Hote, Tinputz, Bugotu, Gela, Tolo) the form for ‘breast’ is different enough from
the portion of the verb that reflects _*-su[su]_ to indicate that POc _*pasu[su]_ ‘give birth’ was
not (or was no longer) derivationally related to POc _*susu-_ ‘breast’. These facts suggest rather
strongly that the answer to question B is ‘no’, _*pasu[su]_ and *pa-susu were not a single verb
in POc.

    The opposing set of evidence is as follows. In Southeast Solomonic and Central Pacific the
POc causative prefix _*pa-_ has been replaced by reflexes of _*paka-_, the causative form that
originally occurred with statives, and so the Arosi, Wayan and Bauan forms appear
transparently to reflect _*pa-susu_, pointing to an affirmative answer to question B. Further, in
certain other languages (Arop-Lukep, Teop, Mota, Raga) the reflex of the _*-susu_ part of POc
_*pasusu_ ‘give birth’ is identical with the reflex of POc _*susu-_ ‘breast’, or nearly so.

[2] The root _*susu_ also formed the directly possessed noun ‘breast, milk’ (§3.5.7).

   How can this conflict be resolved? The answer is a little complicated. The evidence for
POc *pasu ‘give birth’ is well enough distributed (Hote, Bugotu, Gela, Paamese) to suggest
that it was a separate verb from _*pa-susu_ ‘suckle’, and the first set of evidence indicates that it
had no derivational relationship to _*susu-_ ‘breast’. To account for the second set of evidence,
however, we infer that in certain languages the reflex of the _*-susu_ part of _*pasusu_ ‘give birth’
was (by chance?) similar enough to the reflex of _*susu-_ ‘breast’ for reanalysis by folk
etymology to take place, so that the reflex of _*pa-_ was reanalysed as the causative prefix and
the reflex of the _*-susu_ as ‘breast’.

   Thus we answer question B above in the negative. We have no definitive evidence regarding
question A.

4.3      Ingestion and related activities and states

4.3.1 Eating and chewing

In this section are presented reconstructed verbs which have to do with the ingestion of solids.
A pair of verbs meaning ‘eat’ is given in §4.3.1.1. This is followed by verbs of chewing, which
fall into two categories, namely chewing something as part of the process of eating (§4.3.1.2),
and chewing something in order to extract its ingestible content, after which the chewed
remains are spat out (§4.3.1.3). The latter category includes general verbs of chewing without
eating and verbs denoting the culturally significant activity of chewing betelnut.

4.3.1.1 Eating

Across the world’s languages the verbs for ingestion tend to be exceptional in their lexical and
grammatical behaviour. A typical transitive verb like English hit (as in _The man hit the dog_) has
a volitional agent as its subject (the man) and an affected patient as its object (the dog). English
eat and drink, on the other hand, can occur quite naturally in both transitive and intransitive
constructions, e.g. _The man ate the banana_ vs. _The man ate_, whereas it requires considerable
ingenuity to think up possible contexts for intransitive _The man hit_ (cf Næss 2009:35). The
apparent reason that ‘eat’ and ‘drink’ verbs allow a transitive/intransitive alternation in many
languages is that they do not have the kind of meaning that is typically encoded by a transitive
construction (Newman 2009:6). Certainly the person who eats or drinks is normally a volitional
agent, and there is a sense in which what is eaten is an affected patient. But unlike verbs
meaning ‘hit’, or even ‘destroy’, where the fate of the patient is part of what is profiled by the
verb, ‘eat’ and ‘drink’ verbs primarily profile the agent and the effect of the activity on the
agent (rather than on the patient), and this is what allows them to be used in intransitive as well
as transitive constructions (Newman 2009:5, Næss 2009:27–28).

    In some languages this distinction is carried further, as there are separate verbs for
transitive ‘eat (something specified)’ and intransitive ‘eat’ (where what is eaten remains
unprofiled) (Newman 2009:4, Næss 2009:29). One may say, with Newman (2009:5), that
these reflect different conceptualisations of the ingestion activity, one which includes the
ingested patient in its semantic profile (the transitive) and one which excludes it and profiles
only the activity of ingestion (the intransitive). There are a number of Oceanic languages
which have separate verbs for transitive and intransitive ‘eat’. The forms of these pairs of
verbs are cognate with each other, and so it may be inferred that Proto Oceanic also made this
distinction. Proto Malayo-Polynesian distinguished between transitive forms which consisted
of the root plus a suffix or prefix, and an intransitive form with an actor subject. The
intransitive form was marked with the prefix _*paN-_, where _*-N-_ combined with the root-initial
consonant to produce a nasal consonant. Although there are several reconstructed Proto
Oceanic verbs that include a reflex of intransitive _*paN-_, just one of these reconstructed verbs
with _*paN-_ forms a pair with a corresponding reconstructed transitive. This is the pair
meaning ‘eat’, POc _*paŋan_ ‘eat’ (VI) vs _*kani_ ‘eat’ (VT). They reflect the Proto Malayo-Polynesian
forms _*paŋan_ ‘eat (VI)’ and _*kaen-i_ ‘eat (VT), where _*paŋan_ is derived from _*paN-_
+ the root _*kaen_ ‘eat’,[3] and _*kaen-i_ includes the location undergoer voice suffix _*-i_, which
became the POc transitive suffix _*-i_.

[3] The expected PMP form is †_*paŋaen_, but all known reflexes point to _*paŋan_.

As the data above are from primary subgroups of Oceanic, this intransitive/transitive pair
evidently occurred in Proto Oceanic. The fact that this appears to be the only intransitive/
transitive pair retained in modern Oceanic languages reflects the tendency for languages to
encode intransitive and transitive ‘eat’ separately. This in turn reflects the centrality of eating in
human life.

   The forms _*paŋan_ and _*kani_ are treated separately below, as in many Oceanic languages
one of them has displaced the other. More frequently, _*kani_ has replaced _*paŋan_. The latter is
not reflected at all (with the exception of certain forms described below) in New Guinea
Oceanic (NNG and PT), Northwest Solomonic, North/Central Vanuatu, Central Pacific or
Micronesian.

   People in traditional Oceanic-speaking villages ate one cooked meal a day, usually after the
day’s work, and this presumably was also true of POc speakers. The meal typically consisted
of starchy staples, made more appetising by the addition of coconut milk, leafy vegetables and
sometimes some meat or fish (vol.3:36). The lexicons of Oceanic languages thus usually
distinguish two main categories of ingredient, and POc evidently did so too. The relevant
terms are:

__block__
-    POc _*kanaŋ_: starchy staples, including yams, taro, sweet potatoes and other root crops,
     cooking bananas and breadfruit (vol.3:40–41);
-    POc _*tamaji_: the additional ingredients: coconut milk, leafy vegetables and protein foods
     (meat, fish, shellfish) (vol.3:43).

The general meaning of _*paŋan_ and _*kani_ was ‘eat’, but Ross (vol.3:36–40) concludes that
they also had the specific meaning ‘eat starchy staples’. There are three kinds of evidence for
this. First, _*kanaŋ_ ‘starchy staples’ is a nominalisation of the base also found in _*kani_.
Secondly, in Oceanic languages for which there is detailed information about verbs of eating,
there is usually at least one other ‘eat’ verb, with the meaning ‘eat starch and protein food
together’. Sometimes there is also a verb meaning ‘eat meat’, ‘eat fish’ or ‘eat protein food’ and
less often one meaning ‘eat greens alone’ or ‘eat (s.t.) as an accompaniment to starchy
food’ (vol.3:39–41). Significantly, however, there is almost never a separate verb meaning ‘eat
starchy food’, implying that this was the more specific sense of _*paŋan_/_*kani_. Thirdly, on the
rare occasions that a verb meaning ‘eat starch’ is found, it is the general verb of eating
combined with an element indicating that nothing else (other than starch) is eaten, e.g. Anejom
(SV) _topʷ-haŋ_ ‘eat starch without additions’, literally ‘just eat’, where _topʷ_ means ‘only’ and
_haŋ_ is the general verb ‘eat’ (< POc _*paŋan_); Arosi (SES) _ŋau-koŋari_ ‘eat one thing without
relish’, where _ŋau_ is the general verb ‘eat’ (< POc _*ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’, §4.3.1.2) and _koŋari_ is
‘empty’.

226 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond

    There is a semantic association whereby terms for ‘sharp’ (referring to a blade, not a point)
are derived from the verb ‘eat’ or ‘chew’. Reflexes of _*paŋan_, often reduplicated, mean
‘sharp’ in a number of Meso-Melanesian and Southeast Solomonic languages, while reflexes
of _*kani_ mean ‘sharp’ in a number of Northwest Solomonic, Micronesian and Polynesian
languages. Isolated instances also occur in reflexes of the verbs of gnawing _*ŋau_ (Kwaio) and
_*ŋas(i,u)_ (Hoava, Vangunu) (§4.3.1.2). Although this semantic extension of ‘eat’ seems rather
an obvious one, it is not among those listed as occurring crosslinguistically by Newman
(2009).

    A number of the reflexes of _*paŋan_ with the sense ‘sharp’ display reduplication. This
appears to have been an early Oceanic strategy for forming adjectives from members of other
word classes. Colour adjectives, for example, were often reduplicated nouns (vol.2:207–210).
This strategy did not occur with reflexes of _*kani_ that mean ‘sharp’, evidently because
reduplication formed actor-subject intransitive verbs from transitives.

   As noted above, reduplication forms actor-subject intransitive verbs from transitives, and
there are a few reflexes of a possible POc _*kani-kani_ (VI) ‘eat’, namely Motu _ɣani-ɣani_,
Nakanai _al-ali_, Hahon _an-an_, Lungga _ɣa-ɣani_, West Guadalcanal _ɣa-ɣani_, Tamambo _hani-hani_ —
but only the Motu and Tamambo forms are clearly marked as intransitive in the
sources. Madak _an-an_ and Barok _a-an_, both ‘sharp’, are exceptions to the generalisation
above that adjectives are not formed from transitive verbs by reduplication. However, both
sets of reduplicated forms here may be the result of post-Proto Oceanic applications of
productive reduplication rules, rather than reflexes of reduplicated Proto Oceanic forms. It
seems a little unlikely that a putative POc †_*kani-kani_ (VI) ‘eat’ competed with _*paŋan_ (VI)
‘eat’.

    There is a small collection of oddments derived from _*paŋan_ which do not fit into the
cognate sets above. The most intriguing of these is Arosi (SES) _maŋa_ (VI) ‘eat’, (N) ‘bits of
food in the crevices of the teeth after eating’. It appears to reflect PMP _*maŋan_ (Blust 1983-84),
the independent intransitive form corresponding with dependent PAn _*paŋan_ (cf
§1.3.5.5). Only a few Proto Malayo-Polynesian independent intransitive forms survived into
Proto Oceanic, and the history of this form (and why there is just one known Oceanic reflex)
is a mystery.

   Less mysterious are Proto Remote Oceanic _*va-vaŋan-i_ (VT) ‘feed’ and PPn _*fāŋai_ ‘feed, provide food for’,
both causative verbs with a root reflecting POc _*paŋan_ (VI) ‘eat’. It happens that the POc
causative prefix was _*pa-_, giving a causative form _*pa-paŋan-i_, where _*-i_ was the transitive
suffix. The suffix is reflected in Wayan and also accounts (i) for the retention of root-final _-n_ in
Mota, which would have been lost if it was word-final and (ii) for the final _*-i_ of PPn _*fāŋai_. It
appears that the repeated syllable _*pa-_ has been reduced by haplology in Mota and Rotuman,
perhaps because reflexes of the root _*paŋan_ have no function in these languages outside the
causative (as noted above, in the sense ‘eat’ reflexes of the root _*paŋan_ have been replaced by
reflexes of *kani). PPn _*fāŋai_ reflects two idiosyncratic innovations. The first is the
replacement of †_*fafa-_ by _*fā-_. The second is the loss of POc _*-n-_, already noted above with
regard to PPn _*kai_ ‘eat’.

   It was remarked above that POc _*paŋan_ and _*kani_ both probably had ‘eat starchy food’ as
their more specific meaning. Modern Oceanic languages typically have at least one other ‘eat’
verb, with the meaning ‘eat starch and protein food together’. As the sample below shows,
reconstruction of the POc term is impossible, but the concept must have been lexicalised in
POc.

The concept ‘eat meat/fish alone’ was possibly already lexicalised in POc, as _*[q,k]oda(q)_, but
meaning occurs only in Roviana (MM) and as a subsidiary meaning in Wayan Fijian. More
usually the reflexes mean ‘eat s.t. raw’, where the ‘something’ seems most frequently to be
meat or fish (contra the gloss ‘raw seafood; eat raw seafood’ in vol.4:438, footnote 6).

   Meat or fish was a less frequent food ingredient than starchy staples, but it was clearly
valued, as the occurrence of verbs meaning ‘crave for meat/fish’ indicates:

__formgroup__
  PT:     Iduna            -onanaga           ‘crave for meat’
  MM:     Patpatar         bite, bui          ‘crave for meat’
  SV:     Sye              -aŋot              ‘hungry for meat’ (lit. ‘itch’)
  Fij:    Wayan            tovi               ‘crave for meat or fish’

   Terms for ‘eat greens alone’ are rarer, probably reflecting the fact that Oceanic speakers
rarely eat leafy vegetables without any other food:

__formgroup__
  MM: Ramoaaina            odo                ‘eat greens alone’
  SES: Arosi               ŋau-kokona         ‘eat only greens’ (_kokona_ ‘smooth, slippery’)
  Pn:  Tongan              hamu               ‘eat vegetables only’

   PPn _*samu_ seems to have meant something like ‘eat one food only’, and in Nuclear
Polynesian (reflexes other than Tongan and Niuean) ‘eat protein food only’. If the Gedaged
terms below are cognate, then POc _*samu_ is reconstructable, perhaps with the sense ‘eat food
that adds relish to staples’. In the Gedaged area this typically consists of green vegetables,
with a small quantity of fish as a possible addition.

   It is difficult to know if POc _*kamu_ meant more than just ‘eat’. The reflexes below that are
glossed ‘chew (betelnut)’ all occur in the Southeast Solomonic area, and the Rennellese and
Tikopia terms must be borrowings from a Southeast Solomonic language as betelnut has never
been a part of Polynesian culture.

4.3.1.2 Chewing and then eating, gnawing

Chewing is conceptualised in many Oceanic languages as two separate activities: chewing with
the intention of eating, and chewing something of which the residue will afterwards be spat out.
The object of the latter, either implied or specified, is typically sugarcane or betelnut. This
section is concerned with chewing and eating, whilst chewing without eating is discussed in
§4.3.1.3.

   Lichtenberk (1994b) and Ross, Clark and Osmond (vol.1:238) comment on the phonaesthetic
pattern _*kʷV[r,R,s]V-_[5] in POc terms meaning ‘scrape’. A similar pattern, but with initial _*ŋ-_,
appears to be present in chewing verbs such as POc _*ŋari(s)_, _*ŋaris-i-_ ‘gnaw, of animals’ in
this section and POc _*ŋasu_ (VI), _*ŋasi_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut, sugarcane), bite into’ and PNNG
_*ŋuru_ ‘chew (sugarcane)’ in §4.3.1.3, as well as a multiplicity of similar but not fully cognate
forms which are listed under ‘cf. also’ beneath the _*ŋari(s)_/_*ŋaris-i-_ and _*ŋas_ (VI)/_*ŋas-i_ (VT)
sets. The primary chew-and-eat verb POc _*ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’ also begins with _*ŋ-_.

   Two POc verb roots are reconstructed for ‘chew and eat’, _*ŋau_ ‘chew and eat’ and POc
_*ŋari(s)_ ‘gnaw’, _*ŋaris-i-_ ‘gnaw (s.t.), of animals’. The semantic distinction is clear in
Polynesian reflexes where *ŋari- terms refer to gnawing or nibbling by animals, particularly
rats, while reflexes of *ŋau refer to human chewing/eating. A number of reflexes of the latter
have become a general term for ‘eat’.

4.3.1.3 Chewing without swallowing

Seven terms are reconstructed for chewing without swallowing:

__block__
 1.   POc _*ŋas_ (VI), _*ŋas-i-_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut), suck and chew (sugarcane), bite into’
 2.   PNNG _*ŋuru_ ‘suck and chew (sugarcane)’
 3.   POc _*qusi-_ ‘suck and chew (sugarcane)’
 4.   POc _*mamaq_ (VI), _*mamaq-i-_ (VT) ‘chew, masticate but not swallow’
 5.   POc _*meme_ (VI), _*[me]me-i-_ (VT) ‘premasticate food for baby’
 6.   POc _*jamu_ (VI), _*jamʷ-i-_ (VT) ‘chew (betelnut)’ (Ross 1988:78)
 7.   ?? PEOc _*dramu_ (VI), _*dramʷ-i-_ (VT) ‘chew’

   With so many POc terms for the same or similar activities, one would expect them to have
had different uses. Among the glosses of their reflexes one can distinguish general terms that
make no reference to what is chewed, specialist terms used for chewing betelnut or sugarcane,
and terms that refer to premasticating food for a baby. However, it is difficult to attribute
specific meanings to the POc reconstructions because reflexes have undergone meaning shifts.
A small complication is that ‘chew betelnut’ was a meaning in the wordlists elicited by Ross,
but it is possible that terms thus glossed are also used for other kinds of chewing.

   Betelnut chewing is singled out in many Oceanic languages because of its social
significance. Betelnut is a stimulant, Areca catechu, POc _*buaq_ (vol.3:391–395), chewed
throughout lowland New Guinea and NW Island Melanesia.

__blockquote__
      Palms are grown in village groves or singly near houses. The seed may be chewed alone, but
      usually people chew a quid consisting of the seed, lime and a catkin or leaf of Piper betle
      [POc _*[pu-]pulu]_…. Chewing the seed induces salivation, and if lime is present it turns the
      chewed mass bright red. Some people swallow all but the initial burst of saliva, whilst others
      spit out the red masticate. Initially, chewing leads to a very short-lived dizziness, followed by
      a sense of renewed wakefulness. In Papua New Guinea and parts of the Solomons chewing
      betelnut is a social ritual when people meet. Convention requires that the host offer betelnut
      to visitors …. (vol.3:392)

So ‘chewing betelnut’ entails a semantic frame which includes not only the physical practices
but also the assertion of social solidarity associated with chewing.

   Betelnut is not chewed in Vanuatu, Fiji, Polynesia or Micronesia, where a similar social
function is performed by kava-drinking (kava is made from Piper methysticum).

   Another common activity in NW Melanesian villages is chewing a piece of sugarcane,
Saccharum officinarum, POc _*topu_ (vol.3:389–391).

__blockquote__
      The jointed, fibrous stalks contain sucrose, obtained by cutting off a stem and chopping it
      into convenient lengths which are sucked and chewed as a refreshing snack. When the sugar
      has been sucked out, the rubbish is spat out. (vol.3:390)

It has proven easier to identify POc terms for chewing sugarcane than for chewing betelnut.

236 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


    Reflexes of _*ŋas_/_*ŋas-i-_ and _*mamaq_/_*mamaq-i-_ are geographically interlaced in the
North New Guinea and Meso-Melanesian clusters of Western Oceanic,[6] whilst the former
prevails in Southeast Solomonic, the latter in Vanuatu and the Central Pacific. It is difficult to
infer a difference in meaning between them from the glosses of their reflexes. Glosses of the
reflexes of _*ŋas_/_*ŋas-i-_ refer to both betelnut and sugarcane, but the term has reflexes only in
the betelnut-chewing region, suggesting that it was used mainly of chewing betelnut. Glosses
of Western Oceanic reflexes of _*mamaq_/_*mamaq-i-_ refer only to betelnut-chewing, but there
are also reflexes outside the betelnut-chewing region, which tend to denote chewing without
swallowing and in NCV and Polynesian sometimes refer specifically to premasticating food to
be fed to a baby.

    If the canonic derivation of POc verbs from PMP reduplicated monosyllables is applied
(Blust 1977b; see also vol.2:25) to _*ŋas_/_*ŋas-i-_, the expected intransitive form is †_*ŋa-ŋas_,
but this is nowhere reflected, perhaps because the verb’s general meaning typically required an
object specifying what was chewed. However, Banoni and Maringe ŋasa both reflect the
Proto NW Solomonic final echo vowel _*-a_, pointing to an earlier intransitive _*ŋas_.

    It is tempting to attribute Hoava _ŋahu_ and Vangunu _ŋasu_, both ‘sharp’ (under ‘cf. also’
below), to this set, extending the observation that words for ‘sharp’ are sometimes derived
from eating verbs (§4.3.1.1). However, two features speak against this. First, _*ŋasi-_ is not
semantically a verb of eating. Second, final _-u_ is non-etymological. From this perspective,
Mono-Alu _asu_ ‘chew (betelnut)’ is also not a regular reflex of POc _*ŋas_ or _*ŋasi-_. Loss of
initial _*ŋ-_ is regular, but final _-u_ appears to reflect blending of regular pre-Mono-Alu †_*ŋasa_
(the expected reflex of POc _*ŋas_) with a reflex of putative _*ŋasu_ ‘sharp’ (of unknown
antiquity).

to chewing sugarcane. As Oceanic evidence he offers just the Mota reflex, and we have found
one further Oceanic cognate.

[7] _*qusi_ is reconstructed here rather than _*qusu_ because _*-i_ was added to verb roots in POc to form transitive

   Vanuatu reflexes of POc _*meme_ (VI), _*[me]me-i-_ (VT) have the very specific meaning
‘premasticate food for baby’, where the baby is the object of the transitive form. However,
inspection of the glosses below and the glosses of reflexes of POc *mamaq ‘chew betelnut’
above suggests that there has been some blending of the two terms, whereby one of the two
verbs also takes on the meaning of the other. It seems likely that Vanuatu reflexes preserve the
POc sense, since there is no other POc candidate for the meaning ‘premasticate food for
baby’. No reflex from outside Vanuatu with this meaning has been found.

    POc _*jamu_ perhaps meant ‘chew (betelnut)’, as this is its meaning throughout the
betelnut-chewing area. Beyond this area it retains senses related to the fibrous residue remaining after a
plant has been chewed or wrung out. PNCV _*zamʷan_ ‘chew, fibrous residue’ appears to have
been a noun reflecting the POc nominalisation _*jamu-an_, suggesting that the meaning of the
verb at an immediately pre-PNCV stage was something like ‘spit out residue’, a meaning
which is, however, not directly attested. In fact even the verbs in some, if not all, Vanuatu
languages listed appear to be back-formations from the nominalisation. Mota _samʷan_, Kiai
_zama-i-_, Uripiv _o-jəm-jəmʷe_, Ninde _samʷe_, Rerep _jamue_, Nguna _samʷa-e_ all appear to reflect
the suffix _*-an_ (_*-n_ is mostly lost in NCV languages).

    It is tempting to try to associate POc _*jamu_ with _*d(r)amut_ ‘lime spatula’ (vol.1:77), as the
latter belongs to the paraphernalia of betel-chewing, but the resemblance seems to be a chance

    PPn _*samu_ ‘eat scraps’ has the same form as PPn _*samu_ ‘eat one food only’ (§4.3.1.1), but
this is also apparently a chance resemblance.

4.3.2 Drinking and sucking

The verbs reconstructed in this section denote the ingestion of liquids. Like eating (§4.3.1.1),
drinking in general was evidently expressed in Proto Oceanic by a pair of verbs, intransitive
and transitive. There were evidently two lexically encoded manners of drinking. One entailed
opening the mouth and pouring liquid from a vessel (often a young coconut) which did not
touch the lips (§4.3.2.1.1). The other involved contact between the lips and the drinking vessel
and translates roughly as sipping and slurping (§4.3.2.1.2).

   Sucking for Proto Oceanic speakers was perhaps not one category but three or four:
sucking other than at the mother’s breast in order to drink (§4.3.2.2), sucking at the mother’s
breast (§4.3.2.3), sucking at a pipe in order to inhale its smoke (§4.3.2.4), and making sucking
noises (in §4.3.6 below). The glosses of sucking verbs often include ‘kiss’, for which Proto
Oceanic appears not to have had a dedicated term. The Oceanic way of greeting is or was by
pressing the nose to face or limb and sniffing, an action often described as kissing (see POc
_*asok_ (VI) _*asok-i_ (VT) ‘sniff’ in §8.4).

4.3.2.1 Drinking


242 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


Just as a pair of Proto Oceanic verbs _*paŋan_ and _*kani-_, respectively intransitive and transitive
(§4.3.1.1), can be reconstructed for ‘eat’, so too a pair can be reconstructed for ‘drink’:
_*mʷinum_ (VI) and _*inum-i-_ (VT) (cf §1.3.5.5). Unlike terms for ‘eat’, reflexes of the two ‘drink’
verbs appear never to co-occur in an Oceanic language as an intransitive/transitive pair, and in
many languages we find either that a new transitive has been formed from a reflex of
intransitive _*mʷinum_ or that a new intransitive has been back-formed from transitive _*inum-i-_,
giving intransitive _*inum_. Reflexes of the intransitive and transitive do occur, however, in
closely related languages. Thus Bauan Fijian ŋunu/ŋunuv- reflects _*mʷinum_, whilst Boumaa
Fijian inu/inum- reflects _*inum-i-_.

    The derivation of the ‘drink’ pair is different from the ‘eat’ pair. The Proto Malayo-Polynesian
intransitive of ‘eat’ was formed with _*paN-_, whereas the intransitive of ‘drink’ was
formed with a prefix allomorph of the PMP infix _*<um>_, giving _*um-inum_ (§1.3.5.5). Non-Oceanic
languages have sometimes lost initial _*u-_ (e.g. Malay minum), but there is evidence
that it was still present at an immediately pre-Proto Oceanic stage, as it caused labialisation of
_*m-_, giving POc _*mʷinum_ rather than _*minum_ (Lynch 2002e). This is attested both by reflexes
that retain _mʷi-_ and by those that have simplified _*mʷi-_ to mu-.

[8] Geraghty (1990) assigns Nakanai liu ‘drink’ to POc _*iRup_ ‘sip (as soup), slurp’ but Bender et al.
    (2003:29) point out that it reflects POc _*inum_.

244 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   A good many reflexes of POc _*inum_/_*inumi_ have replaced initial _*i-_ with _u-_. This is
probably the result of anticipating the stressed vowel in _*inúmi_, but may also reflect early
analogy with the intransitive form, i.e. _*mʷinum_ > _*munum_, then by analogy _*inum_ > _*unum_.
Because reflexes with _u-_ are readily explained and occur at scattered locations (in languages
of East Nusantara as well as in Oceanic; ACD), we take them to reflect idiosyncratic local
changes and do not reconstruct POc †_*unum_.[9] These reflexes are:

[9] However, Blust (1993, 2009b) argues that PCEMP/POc _*unum_ should be reconstructed alongside PCEMP/
    POc _*inum_ because the lack of western Malayo-Polynesian forms reflecting _*unum_ implies that such forms
    in CEMP languages are not the result of local changes but of the innovation of a PCEMP variant _*unum_.

4.3.2.1.1 Pouring down the throat

A common Melanesian way of drinking, especially from a young coconut with a hole in the
shell, is to tip one’s head back, mouth open, and to pour the coconut water down the throat
without the lips touching the coconut. There is evidence that Proto Oceanic speakers had a verb
for this action, apparently with the form _*gʷagʷa_ or _*gʷaŋʷa_. The first form is reflected in
Tawala (PT), Hahon and Teop (MM, NW Solomonic), the latter by Sursurunga and Siar (MM,
South New Ireland) and Gela (SES). The forms from Solos to Gela all reflect initial _*(k,kʷ)-_,
suggesting that the form may have been _*kʷagʷa_ or _*kʷaŋʷa_. It is possible that the Proto
Oceanic form continues PMP _*kaŋa_ ‘be open, as the mouth’ and that the labialisation of the
consonants is an Oceanic development, perhaps onomatopoeic. If so, then the Proto Oceanic
form was presumably _*kʷaŋʷa_ or _*gʷaŋʷa_.[10]

    Because this was a traditional manner of drinking, it is unsurprising that a number of
reflexes below have the simple gloss ‘drink’.

    The items under ‘cf. also’ are listed because it is remotely possible that they are somehow
related to the POc form. The two MM forms are from Santa Isabel languages, i.e. very close to
Bugotu, and are probably borrowed from there.

[10] Oceanic specialists will recognise that this reconstruction entails one or perhaps two phonemes not usually
     reconstructed for Proto Oceanic (cf §1.3.4.1), namely _*gʷ_ and _*ŋʷ_. Ross (2011) adds to the Proto Oceanic
     consonant inventory the phoneme _*kʷ_, with a decidedly low token frequency and a tendency to appear in
     contexts where a phonaesthetic factor is at play. It would not be surprising if _*gʷ_ and _*ŋʷ_ had also occurred,
     with even lower token frequency.

4.3.2.1.2 Sipping and slurping

The terms reconstructed below refer to drinking from a spoon or bowl and contrast
semantically with the style of drinking denoted by POc _*(gʷ,kʷ)a(gʷ,ŋʷ)a_ ‘drink by pouring
down the throat’ in §4.3.2.1.1.

   Despite the formal and semantic similarities between POc _*iRup_/_*iRup-i-_ ‘sip (as soup),
slurp’ and POc _*soRop_/_*soRop-i-_ ‘absorb (liquid), suck up (liquid), sip, slurp’ (§4.3.2.2), the

4.3.2.2 Sucking-and-drinking

It was mentioned in §4.3.2 that what in European languages is classed as ‘sucking’ evidently
fell into several categories in Proto Oceanic, and continues to do so in modern Oceanic
languages. This section is concerned with verbs whose primary meaning is to suck in order to
drink. These verbs are often also used figuratively of inanimate substances with the sense
‘absorb (liquid)’.

    Three terms reconstructed below, POc _*ñoñop_/_*ñop-i-_ ‘put the face against, kiss, suck,
sniff’, POc _*ñosop_ ‘suck (?)’ and POc _*sosop_/_*sop-i-_ ‘put lips to, kiss, suck, absorb
(moisture)’ are almost certainly derivationally related. The basic PMP form was _*sepsep_,
which by Blust’s (1977) ‘comparative paradigm’ became POc _*sosop_ (VI), _*sop-i-_ (VT).
However, parallel with derivation of the intransitive/transitive pair _*paŋan_/_*kani_
‘eat’ (§4.3.1.1), PMP would have formed an intransitive/transitive pair *(pa)ñepsep (_*paN_ +
_*sepsep_)/_*sepsep_, the first member of which is reflected in Baegu, To’aba’ita and Lau below.
Initial _*pa-_ was lost or was perhaps never present (as in Malay and other languages of western
Indonesia), giving POc intransitive _*ñosop_ (reflected in Lau _noso_). With the collapse of the
intransitive/transitive morphological contrast in early Oceanic, a new transitive was formed
from the resulting disyllable, Proto Southeast Solomonic _*nosov-i_, the direct ancestor of the Baegu, To’aba’ita and
Lau transitive forms. Somewhere in the Malayo-Polynesian dialects ancestral to Proto
Oceanic _*sepsep_ also gave rise to a monosyllabic base _*sep_, from which was formed the
intransitive *(pa)ñep, giving pre-POc _*ñop_, from which by analogy POc _*ñoñop_ was created,
followed by a transitive derivation in some daughter-languages.

    Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _*ñepñep_, but it has few non-Oceanic reflexes, and it seems
likely that the process just described occurred independently in different languages where the
systematic morphological relationship between intransitive (_*paN-_ + root) and transitive
(reduplicated root) had been lost.

   The glosses below indicate that making a noise while drawing in liquid or breath was an
element of the meaning of POc _*soRop_/_*soRop-i-_, and the Sursurunga gloss ‘sniffle’ suggests
that this could occur with the nose as well as with the mouth. This is presumably the basis for
NCV shifts in meaning to ‘snort’, ‘snore’, ‘grunt’, and ‘growl’. Bugotu and Gela soropi below
are almost certainly borrowed from a NW Solomonic language, as the expected reflex is
†_solo_/_solov-i-_. The items listed under ‘cf. also’ reflect an unexplained initial _*t-_ rather than _*s-_.

4.3.2.3 Sucking the breast and suckling

POc apparently had a pair of near homophones for ‘suck (the breast)’, namely _*susup_ (VI),
_*susup-i-_ (VT) and _*susu_ (VI), _*susu-i-_ (VT). POc _*susup_ continues an etymon of PAn antiquity.
POc _*susu_ is the root that also occurs as _*susu-_ ‘breast, milk’ (§3.5.7). The forms are so similar
that it is tempting to try to combine them into a single cognate set, but the differing transitive
forms do not allow this. At the same time, in languages where word-final consonants are lost it
is impossible to determine whether the intransitive form reflects _*susup_ or _*susu_.

    The set below reflects POc _*susup_ (VI), _*susup-i-_ (VT) ‘suck (the breast)’. In each language
the transitive suffix _*-i-_ has prevented loss of the root-final consonant, so that the reflex of
root-final _*-p-_ attests that this is a reflex of _*susup_.

The next set reflects POc _*susu_ (VI), _*susu-i-_ (VT) ‘suck (the breast)’. We know this either
because _*-p_ is absent in the transitive form or because — in the Papuan Tip and Meso-Melanesian
languages listed below — if POc word-final _*-p_ had been present it would have
been retained (as it is in reflexes of _*mawap_ ‘yawn’; cf. §4.5.6).

[11] Blust (ACD) does not reconstruct the sense ‘suck (at the breast)’ for PMP _*susu_, but it is clear from the
     data he cites that it can be reconstructed.

252 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond



    The POc terms for ‘suckle, feed (baby) at the breast’ were _*pa-susup-i-_ or _*pa-susu-i-_,
literally ‘cause to suck’, formed with POc _*pa-_ CAUSATIVE. Conflation of _*susup_ and _*susu_ is
probably also reflected here, and some of the terms listed under POc _*pa-susu_ may in fact
reflect intransitive _*pa-susup_.

    It was noted in §4.2.2.4 that POc _*pasu_[su] ‘give birth’ bears a striking resemblance to
POc _*pa-susu_ ‘suckle’, but concluded that the two POc forms were not (or were no longer)
related.

4.3.2.4 Sucking at a pipe to inhale smoke

The reconstruction of PEOc _*komu_ (VI), _*komi_ ‘suck at (a pipe)’ is somewhat tentative, as SE
Solomonic reflexes except Bauro omu (listed by Fox 1978) end in _-e_ or _-i_, presumably a
transitive formative, whereas the Polynesian reflexes end in _-o_ rather than _u_. However, the
shared sense of sucking on a pipe implies cognacy.

4.3.3 Being hungry, thirsty, replete

4.3.3.1     Being hungry

POc _*pitolon_ seems originally to have been a noun meaning ‘famine’ or ‘hunger’, derived from
PMP _*bitil-en_, where _*-en_ is a nominaliser. The existence of Tuam, Malai, Lukep _pitola_,
Malasanga _butola_, all with final _-a_, suggests that POc may also have had the alternant _*pitolan_,
from PMP _*bitil-an_, where _*-an_ is also a nominaliser. However, in POc _*pitolon_ appears
already to have been used as an adjective or stative verb as well.[12]

    POc also had the term _*mʷalum_, with a meaning similar to that of _*pitolon_.

[12] Whereas PMP _*-an_ survived as POc _*-an_, a nominaliser, PMP _*-en_ survived only as a fossil in a few

  In certain Central Pacific languages the term for ‘be hungry’ is an expression meaning
‘wants to eat’ (cf. ‘want to drink’ for ‘thirsty’ and ‘want to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’; §4.3.3.2, §6.2.1).

A similar locution is reflected in the Mengen languages of SE New Britain, where the term for
‘want’ reflects _*mate_ ‘die’ (§2.1.2):

4.3.3.2 Being thirsty

The root of POc _*[ma]raqu_ ‘be thirsty’ reflects PMP _*laqu_ ‘thirst, hunger’. Unprefixed POc
_*raqu_ has just one known reflex, namely Sio _rako-ña_.[14] Clark (2009) reconstructs the
alternative PNCV forms _*marou_ and _*madou_. These appear to reflect forms with different POc
prefixes, namely _*ma-raqu_ and _*madraqu_, the latter from _*maN-raqu_. It is difficult to
determine exactly what the difference in meaning might have been. POc _*ma-raqu_ would have
meant ‘be thirsty, become thirsty’. The presence of _*maN-_ in _*madraqu_ implies some
agentivity on the part of the subject, as in English ‘work up a thirst’ (§1.3.5.6).

    Blust reconstructs PWMP _*laqu_, implying an expected POc root †_*laqu_, but the data
unanimously support POc _*raqu_.

[14] Clark & Clark (1995) gloss _rako-ña_ as an intransitive verb, but the presence of the 3SG possessor suffix
     _-ña_ suggests that it is or has been an adjective (Ross 1998b).

   A good number of Oceanic languages express the concept of thirst phrasally, as they do for
hunger, and we infer that this strategy may have been a POc alternative to the lexical items
above. First, Central Pacific languages and certain others reflect an expression that means
‘want to drink’ (cf. ‘want to eat’ for ‘hungry’ and ‘want to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’; §3.3.1, §4.6.2.1)

<
PCP *|via inu| ‘thirsty’ (lit. ‘want drink’)

cf. also:

    Second, a number of languages use a body-part expression (cf §9.3) in which the body part
is the neck or throat.

4.3.4 Swallowing

Lynch (2001d) draws attention to the strange collection of hypothetically reconstructable POc
forms for ‘swallow’—strange because they don’t reflect reconstructed PMP regularly and
because they form an unusually large set of apparent variations on a single template.

   If it is assumed that every cognate set found reflects a POc form, then the hypothetically
reconstructable POc forms are those shown in Table 15. We infer that _*toŋol_ reflects
metathesis of _*toloŋ_ and treat these two forms together.

   Earlier reconstructed forms provide some insight into what has happened here. Blust (ACD)
reconstructs PCEMP _*belen_ ‘swallow’ and PMP _*tilen_ ‘swallow’. These have final _*-n_,
whereas the possible POc forms tabulated above have _*-ŋ_ or _*-m_. This apparent idiosyncratic
change requires an explanation. A search of the ACD for earlier forms that match the possible
POc forms in _*-ŋ_ or _*-m_ yields PMP _*teleŋ_ and _*telem_, both ‘sink, disappear under water’.
Lynch suggests tentatively that the POc ‘swallow’ forms in _*-ŋ_ or _*-m_ reflect blends of earlier
‘swallow’ forms in _*-n_ with ‘sink’ forms in _*-ŋ_ or _*-m_ or with _*inem_ ‘drink’.[16] This seems
unlikely, however. When blends occur, there are typically reflexes that retain the meanings of
both input forms, but no known Oceanic form for ‘swallow’ also means ‘sink’ or ‘drink’.[17]

[16] _*inem_ ‘drink’ is a rarely reflected variant of _*inum_ (§4.3.2.1).

258 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


    A more probable explanation is to be found in the earlier forms themselves: _*belen_
‘swallow’ and _*tilen_ ‘swallow’ both end in _*-len_, giving POc _*-lon_. The POc consonants _*l_
and _*n_ both probably had an alveolar point of articulation, and the replacement of _*-lon_ by
_*-loŋ_ or _*-lom_ gave the final consonant a velar or bilabial articulation and thus increased its
distinctiveness. Obviously, this explanation would be stronger if a parallel change were found
in other morphemes. It isn’t. But there are no cases of _*-lon_ amongst our POc reconstructions.

    The fact that pre-Oceanic _*belen_ ‘swallow’ and _*tilen_ ‘swallow’ (both containing the early
Austronesian root _*-len_ ‘swallow’) have been reconstructed explains the distinction between
the first and second columns of Table 15. Under the reasonable assumption that PCEMP
_*belen_ was reflected as POc _*polo_(m), the only peculiarity about the set below is that it is
restricted to Polynesia.

    This brings us to the forms in the four rightmost columns of Table 15. Forms with initial _*t-_
and _*k-_ have one of three medial consonants: expected _*-l-_ and unexpected _*-n-_ or _*-d-_.
Forms with initial _*d-_ have one of two medial consonants: expected _*-l-_ and unexpected _*-n-_.
It is hardly likely that these forms all occurred in Proto Oceanic, unless a semantic factor like
word taboo intervened, and there are no grounds to infer this. Instead, assuming for the
moment that PMP _*tilen_ ‘swallow’ gave rise to the Proto Oceanic alternants _*tiloŋ_ and _*tilom_,
it seems likely from their sporadic distributions that replacements of _*-l-_ by _*-n-_ or _*-d-_
happened independently at different places and times.

[17] The early Austronesian root for ‘sink’ was _*-lem_, and forms derived from this occur in Oceanic
     languages: Nyindrou (Adm) _-lon_ ‘sink’, Nakanai (MM) _tilomu_ ‘sink, drown’, Sursurunga (MM) _lum_
     ‘dive’,‘ _lum-i_ ‘dive to obtain or catch s.t.’, Longgu (SES) _lulumi_ ‘sink’.

   Why might these changes have occurred (and recurred)? Again, the reason perhaps has to
do with the fact that _*t-_ and _*-l-_ had a similar point of articulation. But this cannot be the
whole reason, as the resulting combinations in Table 15, e.g. _*donom_, also have similar or
identical points of articulation. Lynch (2000a) shows that stress in Proto Oceanic words fell on
the penultimate mora, i.e. _*tilóŋ_ and _*tilóm_,[18] and on transitives _*tilóŋi_ and _*tilómi_. Thus there
would have been a strong tendency for the first syllable to be phonetically weakened or
deleted, i.e. *[t(ə)ˈloŋ], *[t(ə)ˈlom], *[t(ə)ˈloŋi] and *[t(ə)ˈlomi], giving the initial cluster *[tl] in
some dialects. Possible articulatory outcomes would have been

__block__
 1. the extension of voicing to *[t], i.e. *[tl] > *[dl];
 2. the nasalisation of *[l] under the influence of *[m], i.e. *[tl] > *[tn] or *[dl] > *[dn].[19]

A possible acoustic outcome would have been

__block__
 3. the mishearing of *[tl] as *[kl] or of *[tn] as *[kn].

Further articulatory outcomes would have been

__block__
 4. the denasalisation of *[tn] to *[td] or of *[kn] to *[kd].
 5. reinterpretation of first-syllable shortened Pre-Oceanic [ə] as /o/, anticipating the stressed vowel, giving _*toloŋ_, _*tolom_ etc.

This account explains

__block__
i)   why _*-n-_ and _*-d-_ don’t co-occur with _*p-_: there is no _*ponom_ or _*podom_ in Table 15,
     because the difference in point of articulation between _*p_ and _*l_ means that changes
     parallel to (1)-(4) did not occur.
ii)  why there is a gap in 4.3.2.3 where _*dodom_ would occur: *[dd] would result in loss of
     distinctiveness.
iii) why the first vowel of the forms in 4.3.2.3 is _*-o-_, not _*-i-_ (as predicted by PMP _*tilen_).
iv) indirectly why _*toloŋ_, was metathesised as _*toŋol_: metathesis increased distinctiveness by
    separating _*t_ from _*l_.

   Just one known Oceanic form reflects the vowels of PMP _*tilen_. The POc status of the
reconstruction has a question mark, as it is possible that the Fijian form has arisen by some
other route. It is unlikely—but not impossible—that Fijian has preserved a form not found
elsewhere in Oceanic. A number of forms reflecting metathesised PWOc _*toŋol_ (p261) also
have _-i-_ in their first syllable, but these are presumably local developments.

[18] A final CVC syllable had two moras and accordingly received stress.

[19] *[dn] could also have arisen though nasalisation, then extension of voicing, i.e. *[tl] > *[tn] > *[dn].

   A metathesised form PWOc _*toŋol_/_*toŋol-i-_ is widely reflected in Western Oceanic
languages. However, bear in mind that Western Oceanic was a dialect network, and ‘Proto
Western Oceanic’ simply refers to the stage when innovations still spread freely across the
network. Evidently the metathesised form coexisted with unmetathesised _*toloŋ_ (VI)/_*toloŋ-i-_,
as attested by the NNG and PT forms above. Indeed, the Megiar dialect of Takia has _-tuluŋ-i-_,
whilst the Karkar Island dialects have _-tiŋal-i_.

   A similarly metathesised form occurs in South Efate and South Vanuatu, and coexists with
an unmetathesised reflex in Anejom. As metathesised reflexes occur in widely separated
Oceanic groups—Western Oceanic and South Vanuatu—one might reconstruct metathesised
POc _*toŋol_/_*toŋol-i-_. However, given the absence of reflexes elsewhere in Oceanic, we assume
that the metathesised forms in Western Oceanic and South Efate/South Vanuatu reflect separate
innovations. The fact that South Efate here groups with South Vanuatu is unsurprising, as South
Efate is the closest external relative of the South Vanuatu languages (Lynch 2000c).

[20] These forms have removed an initial _*tn-_ cluster by deleting initial _*t-_. Cf. footnote 22.

[21] Replacement of _*t-_ by Psohoh _k-_ appears to be a case of cluster misinterpretation, noted in (3) earlier.

[22] These forms have removed an initial _*tŋ-_ cluster by deleting initial _*t-_. Cf. footnote 20.

[23] In certain PT languages _*l_ and _*ŋ_ have both become _n_, so these reflexes are ambiguous as to whether they
   reflect metathesis or not.

[24] In Misima _*l_ and _*ŋ_ have both become _n_. However, _*ŋ_ is lost word-finally, whereas _*l_ isn’t, so _tinon_ reflects
   PWOc _*toŋol_.

   Forms reflecting the denasalisation of _*-n-_ in _*tono_(m) to produce _*todom_ are found in a
very limited range of Meso-Melanesian languages.

The Micronesian set below reflects a hypothetical POc _*to(r,R)om_ rather than _*todom_, but
appears to be an outcome of denasalisation.

[25] In Sissano and Sera n reflects both POc _*n_ and _*ŋ_.

[26] Note metathesis: _*tonomo_ > _*tonmo_ > _tomno_. This is probably borrowed from Bugotu.

[27] Bender et al. reconstruct PMic _*Toromi_, but the data support _*toromi_ equally well.

    Turning now to cases where initial _*t-_ has been voiced to initial _*d-_, there is again no need
to reconstruct these as POc alternants. Forms in _d-_ occur only in NCV languages

Forms reflecting a hypothetical _*donom_ appear in Kilivila and in languages scattered through
north and central Vanuatu. We take the Vanuatu forms to reflect nasalisation of the _*-l-_ of
PNCV _*dolo_ /_*dolom-i-_ above.

__formgroup__
  PT:  Kilivila             donom-i             ‘swallow’

   Moving to forms in which POc _*t-_ has been replaced by _*k-_, the Psohoh and NCV terms
below almost certainly reflect separate local changes.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Psohoh               kluŋ-i              ‘swallow’ (see footnote 21)

  NCV: Kiai                 kolom-i-            ‘swallow’

    A large block of Meso-Melanesian forms appears to reflect a Proto Meso-Melanesian _*konom_, which itself
reflects nasalisation of _*-l-_ as _*-n-_ and acoustic reinterpretation of a _*tn-_ cluster as _*kn-_ (i.e.
(2), then (3), above), followed by vowel insertion. Under ‘cf. also’ are listed MM terms for
‘neck’ which appear to be derived from reflexes of Proto Meso-Melanesian _*konom_.

    Forms reflecting the denasalisation of _*-n-_ in Proto Meso-Melanesian _*konom_ to produce _*kodom_ are also
found in Meso-Melanesian languages. The fact that Tolai kodom (below) appears alongside
closely related Minigir konomi and Tolai (Nodup dialect) konome indicates that denasalisation
is a localised and sporadic phenomenon.

    Forms reflecting a hypothetical POc _*sonom_ (see Table 15) have not been accounted for.
The hypothetical form POc _*solom_ is nowhere reflected, implying that _*sonom_ is not a
phonologically modified form of POc _*tolom_. We offer three hypotheses as to its origin, none
of them fully satisfactory. First, POc _*tilom_ may have given rise to _*silom_ (_*t_ > _s_ is common
before _-i-_ in Oceanic languages), followed by replacement of the vowel as suggested in (5)
above. Second, it may reflect a blend of _*tolom_ with an ancestor of PNNG _*soŋo_ ‘chew
(betel)’, listed below—but this is unlikely, as Bariai reflects POc _*sonom_ and _*soŋo_
separately. Or it may have a separate but unknown extra-Oceanic origin.

   There is just one possible reflex of _*sonom_ with denasalisation (i.e. hypothetical _*sodom_),
namely Nakanai sogomu ‘swallow’ (_g_ < _*d[r]_), but final _-u_ is unexplained.

   The Micronesian set below appears to be formally connected with the sets above, but reflects
a hypothetical POc _*(w)o(rR)o/*(w)o(rR)omi_, which is perhaps explained as an unsourced
loan.

4.3.5 Other actions performed with the mouth

This section contains a miscellany of actions performed with the mouth, the teeth, the tongue
and the lips that do not necessarily entail ingestion.

4.3.5.1 Biting

POc _*kaRati_ and POc _*kati_, both meaning ‘bite’ possibly share a single source somewhere in
their history. Some of the _-r-_less NCV terms, especially from islands towards the south, and all
the Fijian and Polynesian terms could be reflexes of either, though the short _-a-_ of the
Polynesian reflexes probably reflects _*kati_.

    Unambigous reflexes of POc _*koto(p)_ have been found only in NW Solomonic languages
and in one NCV language. However, it is possible that POc _*ŋoto_ (VI), _*ŋot-i_ (VT) ‘bite’
reflects a putative PMP †_*[ma]ŋete[b,p]_, a possible intransitive form of the same root (of
which no non-Oceanic reflexes are known; cf. §1.3.5.5). If so, then the intransitivising
function of initial _*ŋ-_ had clearly been lost in Proto Oceanic, as a new transitive was formed
by adding the POc transitive suffix _*-i_ to the new root.

   Although Blust (ACD) finds plentiful non-Oceanic data for the reconstruction of PMP
_*gutgut_, the only Oceanic reflexes appear to be in Fijian and Micronesian. Blust’s (1977)
canonic derivation of POc verbs from PMP reduplicated monosyllables applies, giving POc
_*kukut_ (VI), _*kut-i_ (VT) ‘bite’.

4.3.5.2 Licking and tasting

POc _*d(r)amʷi(s)_/_*d(r)amʷis-i-_ ‘lick, taste’ is well reflected, but poses some small formal
puzzles. First, PMic _*camʷ(a,i)-ti_ ‘lick’ is odd in that _*-t-_ reflects POc _*-t-_ (i.e. hypothetical
POc _*d(r)amʷ(a,i)t-i-_) rather than the _*-s-_ reflected elsewhere. Second, the data suggest that
both POc _*d(r)amʷis-i-_ and _*d(r)amʷe_ should be reconstructed as transitives corresponding to
intransitive _*d(r)amʷi(s)_ ‘lick, taste’. It may well be that the two forms co-existed, perhaps in
different dialects.

   Third, there is a small cognate set reflecting PNGOc _*d(r)amʷa_/_*d(r)amʷar-i-_ ‘lick’. It is
treated as a separate verb rather than being integrated into the first set below, but the two sets
cannot be distinguished on the basis of meaning.

   Cognates of the next set are evidently derived from POc _*mea_ ‘tongue’ (§3.4.12.4), but no
reconstruction is proposed as borrowing across the NW/SE Solomonic boundary cannot be
ruled out.

4.3.5.3 Holding in the mouth

Oceanic languages display a number of apparently almost-but-not-quite-cognate forms with a
range of meanings that centre on holding in the mouth. The reconstructable POc forms are

__block__
- _*komi_ ‘close the jaws on s.t., hold s.t. in the mouth’ < PMP _*kemi_
- _*ogom_ (VI), _*ogom-i_ (VT) ‘hold in the mouth’ < PMP _*eŋkem_ (see below)
- _*gomu_ ‘keep s.t. in the mouth’
- __*qumu(R)_ ‘suck, hold in mouth’
- _*omu(R)_ ‘roll food around in the mouth’< PMP _*emuR_
- _*mumu(R)_ ‘hold in the mouth and suck’ < PMP _*muRmuR_

Blust’s ACD reveals the reason for this plethora. Proto Malayo-Polynesian also had several such
forms, and the analysis in Blust (1988) suggests that they each have their origins in two early
(or pre-)Austronesian roots, the first two in _*kem_, glossed as ‘enclose, cover, grasp’ and the last
three in _*-muR_, glossed as ‘gargle, rinse the mouth’ (ACD). Four of the resulting POc forms
share _*-om[-]_, giving rise to possible blending. The third, POc _*gomu_, has no known non-
Oceanic cognates, and appears to be an Oceanic blend of _*ogom_ and _*omu(R)_.

    A number of reflexes of POc _*komi_ below contain _-u-_ for _-o-_. POc _*komi_ is reconstructed as
it is the regular continuation of PMP _*kemi_. Items with _-u-_ reflect a tendency for stressed _*-o-_
to be raised before a sequence of _*-m-_ + high vowel (_*-i_ or _*-u_; cf. POc _*gomu_ below).

   Blust (ACD) also lists PMP _*qeŋkem_ ‘enclose; hold in the mouth’ as a possible ancestor of
the forms below, but the absence of a _*q-_ reflex from the SE Solomonic forms points to PMP
_*eŋgem_, or, considering the root _*kem_, PMP _*eŋkem_.

as a result of contamination by POc _*gomu_ ‘keep s.t. in the mouth’ (§4.3.5.3), and the

4.3.6 Actions performed with the lips

The terms in this section denote sucking noises, and it appears that in Proto Oceanic, as in some
modern Oceanic languages, two such noises were recognised. The first was a smacking of the
lips to express a refusal or dissatisfaction, denoted by POc _*misi(k)_. The second, a kissing noise
used to call a dog or pig, or sometimes to attract someone’s attention, was the meaning of POc
_*[u]jumu_/_*[u]jum-i-_.

4.3.6.1 The sucking noise signal

POc _*misi(k)_ is accompanied below by two formally similar reconstructions, _*musi_ and _*mʷiti_,
also meaning ‘suck’ or ‘make a sucking noise’. It is tempting to combine _*musi_ with _*misi(k)_,
reconstructing a hypothetical POc _*mʷisi_. The reason for not doing so is that POc _*misi(k)_ has
widespread reflexes associated with expressing refusal or dissatisfaction, whereas this element
of meaning is missing from reflexes of _*musi_ and _*mʷiti_.[28] Reflexes of _*musi_ and _*mʷiti_ have
similar meanings, but their forms do not allow one to unite them in a single set.

[28] _*mʷ-_ is reconstructed to account for Mapos Buang mul.

[29] Blust (ACD) also cites Ponapean _metik_, _mitik_ ‘kiss’, but the final _-k_ suggests that this is not a native
     Ponapean term. This leaves no Oceanic evidence for reconstruction of _*-k_.

   The obstacle to reconstructing a term for ‘belch’ is almost certainly paucity of data. The
Roviana (Waterhouse 1949), Bugotu (Ivens 1940), Lau (Fox 1974) and Kwaio (Keesing
1975) dictionaries, for example, include no entry for ‘belch’ or ‘burp’.

4.3.7.3 Farting

There are a number of terms for ‘fart, break wind’. The most widespread is POc _*bʷisi_, which
seems from some of its glosses to have originally had the sense ‘spurt, splash’. This was
perhaps a euphemism which almost replaced the inherited term, POc _*(q)utut_ ‘fart’, for which
there is just one known reflex. Other terms are also likely to have arisen via euphemism.

4.4     Emitting and eliminating substances from the body

In §3.8, terms for the substances emitted by the body are reconstructed. In this section we
reconstruct the verbs associated with the emission or elimination of these substances. However,
there is no one-to-one correspondence between substance terms and verbs (and this is probably so
across languages generally). POc speakers used the same terms, or terms derived from the same
roots, for ‘saliva/spittle’ and ‘spit’ (§4.4.3), for ‘perspiration’ and ‘perspire’ (§4.4.6), ‘urine’ and
‘urinate’ (§4.4.7) and in one of two instances for ‘faeces’ (§3.8.6) and ‘defecate’ (§4.4.8). For
‘blood’ there was perhaps no associated verb ‘bleed’. For ‘earwax’ there is no corresponding verb.
For ‘tears’ (§3.8.1) the associated verb is ‘weep’ (§4.7.3), but the latter has a wider range of
meanings than ‘tears’ and there was in any case apparently no single-word term for tears. Oddly,
the term for ‘snot, nasal mucus’ (§3.8.3) is the root of a verb meaning ‘grunt, growl,
snore’ (§3.3.7).

   Some verbs associated with the emission of substances from the body are handled in other
sections. Vomiting (§4.4.4) is placed under events involving the digestive system, and
weeping (§4.7.3) under physical responses to emotion or pain.

   Bodily function verbs like ‘sneeze’, ‘yawn’, ‘urinate’ and ‘die’ are intransitive in their
simple form. However, a typical POc verb will also have derived transitive forms carrying
additional information. With verbs of secretion and excretion the transitive form in _*-i_ took a
location as its object (‘he urinated on the ground’), and the transitive form in _*-akin[i]_
marked the product as the object (Evans 2003:197–199).31

4.4.1 Bleeding

No POc verb meaning ‘bleed’ can be reconstructed with certainty. POc _*ma-draRa(q)_ (cf POc
_*draRa(q)_ ‘blood’, §3.3.3) almost certainly meant ‘bloody’ (_*ma-_ formed property expressions;
§1.3.5.4), but it is unclear whether it also had the dynamic verbal sense ‘bleed’, or whether the
etymon first acquired this sense in PSOc.

such a phrase was also used in POc.

4.4.2 Menstruating

No reconstructions have been made. Many dictionary terms are euphemisms as in Molima
_tabu-tabu_, Niue _gagao fifine_ ‘woman’s illness’, Tongan _fakakelekele_ ‘make unclean’, ’Are’are
_ʔoni i sihani_ ‘stay outside (the village)’. Marshallese uses a term _betektek_, an irregular
derivation from POc _*taqe_ ‘excrement’. Various terms collected, including Tolo _reivula_ (_vula_
‘moon’) and Owa _fagaifa_ ‘moon, month, woman’s period’ reflect an association with the moon.

4.4.3 Spitting and spittle

Apart from compounds meaning ‘water of mouth’, i.e. saliva’ (§3.8.4), POc terms for ‘to spit’
and ‘spittle, saliva’ are remarkably recalcitrant when it comes to formal reconstruction, as two
families of reconstructions are found, each containing several sets of related forms. For
convenience we refer to them as (1) the _*isu_ and (2) the _*supa_ families. Each set within each
family yields a distinct reconstruction attributable to POc or PWOc, a situation which does not
allow reconstruction of a single form at the POc interstage.

    The _*isu_ family includes POc _*kanisu_, PWOc _*kamisu_, POc _*ŋisu_ and POc _*k(i,u)su_.
Even these forms are questionable, as daughter languages also reflect the final _-isu_ as _-usu_ or
_-usi_.[32] This alternation appears to go back to PEMP, as Serui-Laut _kunui_ reflects _*kanusi_ whilst
Wandamen _kanisu_ reflects _*kanisu_ (Blust 1978a:213). A further complication is that Blust
reconstructs both the PEMP and POc forms with _*q-_, but the two EMP forms and Ubir, Motu
and Fijian all reflect _*k-_, as reconstructed here. Polynesian languages reflect an irregular PPn
_*q-_.

[32] It is tempting to argue that _-usi_ includes a reflex of the transitive suffix _*-i_, but the glosses do not support this,
     and the form would be irregular, the regular form being †_-isu-i_ or †_-usu-i_.

   At first sight the forms below look like reflexes of _*kanisu_ in which _*-n-_ has been replaced
by _-m-_. However, there is nothing to cause this replacement, and the geographic distribution of
the reflexes points to a separate earlier form with _-m-_.[33] SE Solomonic forms and Dorig lack
_*ka-_.

   POc _*kisu_ or _*kusu_ is reconstructed below because it perhaps provides the key to
understanding this family of reconstructions.

[33] We have chosen to treat Laghu _ki-knisu_ and Blablanga _na-pnisu_ as reflexes of an earlier _*kmisu_, reflected in
     Kokota and Maringe, rather than of _*kanisu_, but nothing depends on this decision.

    Alternating POc reconstructions sometimes reflect alternations in PMP verbal morphology
(§1.3.5), and this appears to be the most complex case we have encountered. POc _*kisu_/_*kusu_
evidently reflects a PMP verb, for which, however, no non-Oceanic evidence is known. POc
_*ŋisu_/_*ŋusu_ reflects the intransitive (actor voice) form of the verb, formed by replacing the
initial _*k-_ of the root with the homorganic nasal _*ŋ-_ (§1.3.5.6). PWOc _*kamisu_/_*kimusu_
appears to reflect an alternative form of the intransitive, formed by infixing _<um>_ after the
initial consonant of the root, giving expected POc †_*k<um>isu_ or †_*k<um>usu_. Finally, the set
_*kanisu_/_*kanusu_/_*kanusi_/_*kinusu_ appears to reflect a nominalisation formed by infixing _<in>_
after the initial consonant of the root, giving expected POc †_*k<in>isu_ or †_*k<in>usu_, the latter
reflected in Tabar _kinocu_. The _*-a-_ vowel in POc _*kanisu_/_*kanusu_/_*kanusi_ and PWOc
_*kamisu_ is taken to reflect epenthesis, as the infixes were almost certainly not stressed in POc,
giving forms like _*[k(ə)nisu]_ and _*[k(ə)misu]_ (cf. Kokota and Maringe _kmisu_).

    The second family of forms includes POc _*supa_ and _*ka-supa_, where _*ka-_ appears to
reflect the PMP formative _*ka-_ found in stative intransitive verbs (§1.3.5.4). However, this is
uncertain, as _*ka-supa_ is not stative in meaning. The Nakanai, Boumaa Fijian and
Micronesian reflexes of _*ka-supa_ point to a transitive with an unexplained root-final _*-t_.[34]
Here again there are variant forms, but we have no explanation for these: the forms listed
below _*ka-supa[t-i]_ under ‘cf. also’ reflect a replacement of _*-s-_ by _*-n-_ (Roinji), by _*-t-_
(Nakanai) or _*-(r,R)-_ (Bulu, Bola, Misima).

     Finally, Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _*qizuR_,[36] with just two known Oceanic reflexes:

[35] Wayan _katasivi_ and its derivatives reflect a blend of _kata-_, which occurs in verbs denoting noises from
     the mouth (_kata-sīsī_ ‘hiss “pssst”’, _kata-som_ ‘signal with a squeaky kissing sound’) and PCP _*kasivi_
     ‘spit’ (Andrew Pawley, pers. comm.).

[36] Blust reconstructs this form as Proto Western Malayo-Polynesian, but we do not believe that this node
     existed (vol.4, ch.1, §3.2.2). Instead, reconstructions at this interstage represent PMP items of which no
     CEMP reflexes were known at the time of reconstruction. The presence of Oceanic reflexes here
     confirms the PMP attribution.

   One further term _*puRuk_ ‘spray water from the mouth; spray a mixture of saliva and

4.4.4 Vomiting

Two POc terms have been reconstructed, _*[mu]mutaq_ and _*luaq_. A number of languages (Lou,
Gela, Longgu, To’aba’ita, Kwaio) have reflexes in both sets. Their glosses suggest that
_*[mu]mutaq_ simply meant ‘vomit’, whereas _*luaq_ denoted forceful ejection of a substance
from the body, as discussed below.

    POc _*mutaq_ reflects PMP _*um-utaq_, i.e. the root preceded by the intransitive actor voice

   The Lou, Mangap, Gela, Kwaio and Samoan terms suggest that POc _*luaq_ may have
implied a more forceful action of vomiting or spitting, perhaps also including the ejaculation
of seminal fluid as in To’aba’ita and Rennellese. As with the verbs of secretion and excretion
discussed in §4.4, the transitive form in _*-i_ took a location as its object (_*luaq-i_ ‘vomit on’),
and the transitive form in _*-akin[i]_ marked the product as the object (_*luaq-akin[i]_ (VT)
‘vomit s.t. up’).

4.4.5 Ejaculation of seminal fluid

No separate term for ejaculation of seminal fluid can be reconstructable, but it seems possible
that this was one of the senses of POc *luaq above (§4.4.4), as this is one of the meanings of
the To’aba’ita and Rennellese reflexes of the latter.

4.4.6 Sweating, perspiring and perspiration

POc _*maqono_ ‘sweat’ appears from its form (_*ma-_ + disyllabic root) to have originally been a
verb, but a number of its reflexes, often reduplicated, are now nouns. The absence or presence
of final _*-ta_, reflected in ’Are’are and Maewo, is unexplained.

    No extra-Polynesian cognates of PPn _*ka-kawa_ have been found.

4.4.7 Urinating and urine

PMP _*miqmiq_ ‘urinate, urine’ seems to have had two POc reflexes, (i) the expected form
_*mimiq_ and (ii) a form _*mimi(s)_ in which _*-q_ was replaced by _*-s_. The final _*-s_ surfaces only
in the transitive form _*mimis-i-_ ‘urinate on’, and it is of course possible that some of the
reflexes assigned to _*mimi(s)_ below in which no final consonant is retained should be assigned
to _*mimiq_ and vice versa.

    Assignments of forms in which no final consonant is retained are made on the basis of the
geographic distribution of reflexes of the two forms. Forms that reflect _*-q_ are located in NNG
and PT languages, in the northernmost subgroup of Meso-Melanesian, namely Tungag-Nalik
of northern New Ireland, and in scattered NCV languages of Malakula. Forms that reflect _*-s_
are found in Nakanai (MM, Willaumez), in several SE Solomonic languages, in a number of
NCV languages from Ambae and Malakula, and in Bauan and Wayan Fijian. Admiralties
forms have all lost the final consonant, but are assigned to _*mimiq_ on the assumption that
Proto Admiralty separated early from the rest of Oceanic and is more likely to have preserved
the conservative form _*mimiq_. All other forms that have lost the final consonant occur in the
region of _*mimis-i-_ forms and are assumed to reflect _*mimi(s)_.

    But there are complications. Several languages assumed to reflect _*mimiq_ actually reflect a
variant _*memeq_. They are Mussau, Mumeng, Kapin, Lala and Bali—well scattered. A number
of South New Ireland languages and Proto NW Solomonic, assumed to reflect _*mimi(s)_,
usually retain POc final consonants, but the relevant reflexes below all have the form _mimi_,
suggesting that the final consonant was irregularly lost in these languages. And finally a
number of North/Central Vanuatu and New Caledonian languages reflect PSOc _*meRe-_
‘urine’, _*[me]meRe_ ‘urinate’, _meRes-i-_ ‘urinate on’.[37] This seems to be a variant of POc
_*mimi(s)_ ‘urinate’, _*mimis-i-_ ‘urinate on s.t.’ which replaces the root _*mimis_ with the root
_*meRes_.[38]

[37] The New Caledonian items listed here do not reflect POc _*s_ or _*q_. John Lynch (pers. comm.) suggests
     that they should accordingly be assigned to _*meRe-_, as they regularly lose _*R_.

[38] Clark reconstructs _*-r-_. We reconstruct _*-R-_ because François (2011) has shown that _*R_ tends more
     strongly to be lost the further south one moves in the NCV area, and _*meRes_ adheres to this pattern.

288 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond

   It is difficult to offer an explanation of this variation, other than to suggest that euphemism
may have led to wordplay. But this does not account for the fact that almost all the forms
mentioned above occur in NCV languages, and that closely related languages have in some
cases inherited different forms.

    The set of forms below has no known cognates outside New Guinea Oceanic (NNG, PT)
and raises several puzzles. If the PNGOc etymon was a trisyllable with final -CV, then its
reduction to a disyllable in Wab, Bing and Numbami is puzzling. It would be explained if Sio
busali were originally a transitive verb reflecting suffix _*-i_ ‘urinate on’. The PNGOc
intransitive root ‘urinate’ would then have been _*bʷaju(r,R)_,[40] the transitive _*bʷaju(r,R)-i_, but
the PT forms in final _-u_ do not support this reconstruction, as the default vowel added after an
inherited final consonant in Suauic languages (i.e. Tubetube and Suau) is _-i_, not the attested _-u_.
Furthermore, the sets of forms listed under ‘cf. also’ appear to reflect PPT _*bʷasoso_ and PPT
_*bʷasi_ and their relationship to the reconstructed form is not understood.

[40] The indeterminacy of _*-(r,R)_ is present in most PNGOc reconstructions that reflect POc _*r_ or _*R_ as the
     latter merged in most Western Oceanic languages.

4.4.8 Defecating

Like POc _*mimiq_, reflexes of POc _*pekas_ are generally intransitive, but can be transitivised
when additional information is included (_*pekas-i_ ‘defecate on s.t.’, _*pekas-aki[ni]_ ‘defecate
s.t.’). POc _*taqe_ was primarily a noun, ‘faeces’, but is reflected as a verb in some languages
(see §3.8.6).

    When more than one term is reconstructable, one may be used as a polite term. e.g. in
Tikopia _tiko_ is the regular word, while _peka_ is used in the presence of kin with whom
constraint of relationship is observed.

    A number of languages use reflexes of POc _*tape_ ‘to flow’ (vol.2:93), commonly referring
to the flow of blood or other liquids, but sometimes referring to excretory functions (Gela
_tave toba_ ‘diarrhoea’, Mota _tatave_ ‘to excrete’).


4.5    Respiration and events involving the respiratory organs

4.5.1 Breathing

POc _*[ma]ñawa_ ‘breathe’ is among a small group of experiential POc verbs beginning with the
prefix _*ma-_ where the intransitive subject is a human experiencer (Evans 2003:276; §1.3.5.4).
Other _*ma-_ initial verbs discussed here include POc _*[ma]soru_ ‘hiccup’, POc _*mawap_ ‘yawn’,
and _*[ma]turu(R)_ ‘sleep, to be asleep’.

                                                          Bodily conditions and activities 293

   There is a great deal of variation in the English glosses of reflexes, but much of it falls into
place when it is recognised that the inherited core meaning of POc _*[ma]ñawa_ was something
like ‘living essence, soul’ of a human being, which included breathing and the beating heart as
the physical manifestation of life. ‘Rest’ follows from this: cf. English ‘take a breather’.

   Occasional reflexes of POc _*[ma]ñawa_ include reference to the fontanelle. This is a visible
pulse in a young baby, reflecting the fact that the baby is alive.

   Proto Polynesian has two reflexes of POc _*[ma]ñawa_, namely PPn _*mānawa_ ‘breathe;
breath’ and PPn _*manawa_ ‘belly’. In consequence it is tempting to reconstruct a pair of POc
(near-)homophones, but this would probably be a mistake, as the contrast between short and
long vowels is a Central Pacific (Fijian and Polynesian) phenomenon. PPn _*mā-_ marked an
undergoer-subject intransitive verb, and _*mānawa_ was a verb meaning ‘breathe’. The nominal
‘breath’ gloss represents a derivation. PPn _*manawa_ on the other hand was a noun, ‘belly’.

   The two Polynesian sets are kept separate below, even though the reflexes of the two forms
are identical in several (especially Eastern Polynesian) languages where the long/short vowel
distinction has been lost in this pair of etyma.

4.5.2 Gasping and panting

There are no well populated cognate sets for ‘gasp’ or ‘pant’, but there are enough data to allow
two reconstructions. Only the first, POc _*oŋap_ ‘pant, be out of breath’, has known non-Oceanic
cognates, and only its Gela reflex is problem-free. Other reflexes display the irregularities
indicated in parentheses, and the first three lack a reflex of initial POc _*o-_.

4.5.4 Blowing air from the mouth

Several POc verbs of blowing are reconstructable, but most of these refer to the blowing of the
wind, and are presented in vol.2:125–127. The only POc verbs which we can say with some
confidence denoted a person blowing air from the mouth are the pair _*ipu_ and _*upi_, which
probably have a common origin in PMP _*ibut_ ‘breeze, draught of wind’. We can be reasonably
confident about their meaning because their reflexes are used of playing traditional flutes and
by extension for the flutes themselves (vol.1:107–108).

4.5.6 Yawning

A single cognate set embraces all of Oceanic and indeed all the Austronesian family. Blust
(ACD) writes:

__blockquote__
    Irregular reflexes of PAn _*Suab_ are quite common, particularly in the Oceanic languages.
    The cognation of such Oceanic forms as Seimat maw (where only -/w/ remains from the
    original stem) with Western Malayo-Polynesian forms such as Kelabit _uab_ is clear from the
    fairly abundant intermediate forms that reflect PAn _*ma-Suab_ ( > _ma-huab_ > _ma-uab_ > _mawab_).

__blockquote__
    A perfect parallel is seen in PAn _*ma-Seyaq_, POc _*mayaq_ ‘shy, ashamed’. In both cases the
    boundary between the stative prefix _*ma-_ and the stem has been lost in all CEMP witnesses.
    The only non-CEMP language in which a similar loss of morpheme boundary has taken
    place is Chamorro (with _magap_, for expected _**magwap_ ‘yawn’). Following the reanalysis
    of _*ma-uab_ as _*mawab_ a number of CEMP languages have either introduced a new stative
    marker, or have reduplicated the first syllable of the new stem. It remains unclear how many
    of these added syllables (if any) are the result of convergent developments (ACD).

Reduplicated forms of the kind Blust refers to are shown separately below the main cognate
set.

4.5.7 Coughing

It is difficult to detect any difference in meaning between POc _*koso_, POc _*pukuR_/PROc
_*puRuk_ and PWOc _*kuk(a,u)_. Rather, POc _*pukuR_ appears to be synonymous with _*koso_ and
to have won out in the Bel group (part of North New Guinea) and in much of SE Solomonic.
POc *kuk(a,u) is intriguing: few reflexes are found, but their distribution indicates a POc origin.

Two terms are reconstructed, POc _*s(i,u)r(i,u)(t)_ ‘sniff, blow nose’ and POc _*paŋus_, _*paŋus-i-_
‘blow one’s nose’. The latter almost certainly bears a historical relationship to PAn _*Siŋus_/PMP

4.5.9 Sneezing

Forms for ‘sneeze’ can be divided into two main groups:

__block__
•    a western group embracing the Admiralties, Western Oceanic and SE Solomonic, reflecting
     putative onomatopoeic POc forms such as ?_*(k)asipeŋ_, POc ?_*(k)asiŋe(k)_ or ?_*(k)asio_;
•    an eastern group embracing Vanuatu and Micronesia, reflecting Proto Remote Oceanic _*mʷat(i,u)a_
     ‘sneeze’.

In addition there are numerous cognate sets too local in extent to be included here.

   The reconstructions associated with the western group are prefixed by a question mark
because (i) the data support several formally similar but distinct reconstructions; and (ii) the
data contain a good many irregularities (shown in parentheses below) in relation to normal
sound correspondences. Both phenomena suggest that onomatopoeia (sound symbolism) has
been at work, sometimes resisting the effects of regular sound change, sometimes making
otherwise arbitrary changes in forms. For example, the MM reflexes below of POc ?_*(k)asipeŋ_
point to _*(k)atipeŋ_, i.e. _*-s-_ was at some point replaced by _*-t-_. The Gela, Lengo and Longgu
reflexes below reflect unpredicted loss of _*(k)a-_ and Gela and Lengo reflect apparent resistance
to the sound change that lenited _*-s-_ to _-h-_ or _-ð-_. In each case the innovation (or lack of one) is
restricted to a small area.

   If the Mussau and Titan forms below are indeed cognate with the NNG forms (the
correspondences are regular), then POc ?_*(k)asiŋe(k)_ can be tentatively reconstructed. All the
NNG forms reflect _-s-_, the fortis reflex of POc _*-s-_, where a lenis reflex (in languages from
Lukep to Ham either _-y-_ or -0̷-) is expected. This seems to be an instance of resistance to
sound change for the sake of onomatopoeia.

POc ?_*(k)asipeŋ_ and POc ?_*(k)asiŋe(k)_ above is a matter for speculation. POc ?_*(k)asio_ is
self-evidently onomatopoeic. Again _-s-_, the fortis reflex of POc _*-s-_, is found where a lenis
reflex is expected. Precisely because of its sound symbolism, it is uncertain whether the form
existed in POc.

The set below is also onomatopoeic, and it is open to debate whether the Meso-Melanesian and
Polynesian forms reflect a single POc form or are the result of parallel independent innovations.
The Nakanai forms are added because they illustrate effects of onomatopoeia. Superficially
they appear to belong to this set, but Nakanai _-h-_ reflects POc _*-q-_, found in none of the forms
reconstructed above. Whatever their origins, the Nakanai forms must have acquired _-h-_ through
sound symbolism, not by cognacy with forms in any of the western sets presented here.

   The eastern group of ‘sneeze’ forms, reflecting Proto Remote Oceanic _*mʷat(i,u)a_ ‘sneeze’, is perhaps
historically related to an onomatopoeic form like those above via an earlier _*mu-atia_, where
_*mu-_ reflects the PMP actor-voice (intransitive) affix _*<um>_/_*(u)m-_ (§1.3.5.5).

4.6    Sleeping and waking

4.6.1 Sleeping

One POc term for sleeping is reconstructed, _*[ma]turu(R)_ ‘sleep, be asleep’, alongside two
PWOc terms, _*[ma]puta_ ‘sleep’ and PWOc _*mataip_ ‘be fast asleep’. PEOc _*mo(q)e_ ‘be fast
asleep’and PCP *moze ‘sleep’ are also discussed below.

    POc _*[ma]turu(R)_ (VI) ‘sleep, to be asleep’ contains the _*ma-_ stative prefix that indicates
that the subject is a human experiencer (Evans 2003:276). Only Bali and Blablanga (MM)
reflect the root _*tuduR_ alone, whilst Bola, Nakanai and Meramera (all Willaumez languages)
add mata ‘eye’ to the root to form ‘sleepy’ (§4.6.2.1).

    No reflexes of POc _*[ma]turu(R)_ are found in New Guinea Oceanic (NNG, PT)
languages. In these it is fairly consistently replaced by reflexes of _*qenop_ ‘lie’ (§6.2.3), its
meaning extended to include both ‘lie’ and ‘sleep. The converse meaning extension whereby a
reflex of _*[ma]turu(R)_ comes also to mean ‘lie’ is much rarer but is reflected in three New
Ireland languages below: Lavongai, Tigak and Tabar.

   How PWOc _*[ma]puta_ differed in meaning from POc _*[ma]turu(R)_ is not clear.
Curiously, the seemingly cognate PPn verb *ma-futa meant ‘start up, arise, awake from sleep’.
Whether the apparent cognacy is real—with an odd reversal of meaning—or simply a chance
resemblance remains unclear.

   The two reconstructions below, PEOc _*mo(q)e_ ‘be fast asleep’ and PCP _*moze_ ‘sleep’, are
similar in form, but cannot be united. If the reflexes of PEOc _*mo(q)e_ are cognate with those
of PCP _*moze_, then the former have undergone unexpected loss of PEOc _*-s-_.

4.6.2 Being tired

A number of languages distinguish between ‘sleepy’ (‘eye tired’) and ‘weary’ or
‘exhausted’ (‘body tired’) through the use of body-part metaphors.

__formgroup__
  Adm: Seimat          |pula lihian  |   [his.eye tired]     ‘sleepy’
  Adm: Seimat          |tinu nohan   |   [his.skin tired]    ‘exhausted, weary’
  PT:  Kilivila        |imama mati-la|   [tired eye-his]     ‘he is weary’
  PT:  Kilivila        |imama nona   |   [tired mind]        ‘he is mentally exhausted’
  PT:  Kilivila        |imama wou-la |   [tired body-his]   ‘he is utterly weary’


4.6.2.1 Being sleepy

In widely distributed Oceanic languages the idiomatic way of saying ‘I am sleepy’ is a phrase
meaning ‘my eyes are sleeping’. In the examples below, the reflex of POc _*mata-_ ‘eye’ is
shown with a following hyphen because it takes a possessor suffix (reflecting _*-gu_ ‘my’, _*-mu_
‘your.S’, _*-ña_ ‘her/his’ etc). The verb in each case is glossed ‘sleep’.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Mangap              |mata- pot     |     ‘be sleepy, slacken, abate, wane’
  PT:  Gumawana            |mata- i-masisi|     ‘be sleepy’
  MM: Nehan                |mata- hohou   |     ‘be sleepy’

In a number of languages the phrasal expression has evolved into a compound.

__formgroup__
  PT:  Misima               mata-kenukenu      ‘sleepiness’
  MM: Bola                  mata-tulu          ‘sleepy’
  MM: Nakanai               mata-tu-tulu       ‘sleepy’

  NCV: S Efate              met-matur          ‘sleepy’

In yet other languages a different verb is used with ‘eye’, either in a phrase or a compound. The
meaning of that verb follows these examples.

__formgroup__
  PT:  Tawala               mata-pota       [eye-shut]              ‘sleepy’
  PT:  Motu                 |mata ɣara    |   [eye burn]              ‘sleepy’

  NCV: Lewo                 |mara- kawa |     [eye- ache]             ‘sleepy’

And in other languages the meaning of the verb is not given independently in the dictionary. In
some languages it is glossed ‘sleepy’, suggesting that an earlier independent meaning may have
been lost.

  NCV: Paamese              |mete- muloŋ     |  ‘sleepy’

   A number of languages use a phrase meaning ‘wants to sleep’ for ‘sleepy’. Arosi has a
desiderative prefix gasi that can be used before any verb, hence gasi mauru ‘sleepy’ [want
sleep]. Some Central Pacific languages do the same thing with a reflex of the desiderative
particle _*via_ (§11.5) and a term for ‘sleep’ (cf. ‘wants to eat’ for ‘hungry’ and ‘wants to drink’
for ‘thirsty’; §§4.3.3.1–2).

4.6.2.2 Being weary, exhausted

Oceanic languages commonly have different terms to express different kinds of bodily
tiredness, e.g. ‘weak’, ‘fatigued’, ‘exhausted’. The Tolai and Bugotu dictionaries, for instance,
each list five terms with general meaning ‘tired, weary’. Body part metaphors also make fine
distinctions in meaning, e.g.

__formgroup__
     NNG: Yabem   |ʊli popoʔ|  [his.body shattered]  ‘he is exhausted, worn out (after hard work)’
     NNG: Yabem   |ʊli kɪtuŋ|  [his.- body burns]    ‘his body aches, is worn out, exhausted’

POc, PCP and PPn terms are reconstructed.

   POc _*malu[malumu]_ ‘weak, tired’ is a partial reduplication of POc _*[ma]lumu_ ‘soft,
gentle, easy’ (vol.2:215). The Polynesian reflexes show irregular loss of _*-m-_.

<

   PCP _*wai-wai_ ‘weak, tired’ is apparently a reduplicated reflex of POc _*waiR_ ‘river, fresh
water, stream’ (§1.3.5.4). The gloss of Wayan wai-ðala ‘be weak (of kava etc), diluted, melt,
dissolve’ points to the connection between water and weakness.

   PPn _*fītaqa_ ‘be tired, fatigued’ evidently reflects POc *pita ‘heavy, difficult’, reconstructed
below, with the addition of an apparent suffix _*-qa_ (which may reflect the POc adjectivaliser
_*-ka_; Ross 2000).

[41] Clark (2009) reconstructs PNCV _*malo~*male_ ‘lazy, tired, weak’. The relationship between this and POc
     _*malu[-malumu]_ is not clear.

4.6.3 Dreaming

The two POc forms _*nipi_ and _*mipi_, both ‘dream’, reflect fossilised combinations of a reflex of
the PMP root _*hipi_ ‘dream’ and the PMP voice affixes _*<in>_ and _*<um>_ (§1.3.5.5). The fact that
both forms are reflected, interspersed with one another across a substantial part of Oceania,
indicates that the two forms co-existed in POc.

   A Proto Central Pacific intransitive verb, _*qadra_ ‘awaken, be awake’, is reconstructable,
but no POc intransitive verb with this sense has been identified. The reason seems to be that an

If Lau ada ‘open the eyes, use the eyes’ belonged to this set, _*(q)adra_ could be reconstructed to
PEOc. However, the regular Lau reflex of _*(q)adra_ would be _sada_ with prothetic _s-_ following
loss of _*q-_, and Lau _ada_ appears instead to be a regular reflex of POc _*tadraq_ ‘look up,
see’ (§8.2)).

4.7.2 Grinning

Grinning is closely associated in Oceanic languages with baring the teeth, and in a number of
languages the term for ‘tooth’ is derived from the term for ‘grin’. POc _*sisi_, _*ŋiŋi_ and _*ŋisi_
each have a PMP antecedent. The history of POc _*[ŋi]ŋisa_ is discussed below.

   Oceanic languages often appear to lack a dedicated verb for smiling. Instead, verbs for
‘laugh’ or ‘grin’ are sometimes additionally glossed ‘smile’.

POc *sisi ‘smile, show one’s teeth, bare one’s teeth’
 NNG: Gedaged        sisi               ‘draw up (the lips, as when smiling)’
 NNG: Manam          (ao)sisi           ‘to smile, of long duration’ (_ao_ ‘smile, laugh’, _sisi_ ‘skin the bark off a tree’)
 NNG: Nenaya         (ma)sisi           ‘laugh’
 SES: Tolo           sisi(la)           ‘smile; show one’s teeth’
 SES: Sa’a           sisi               ‘roll back, grin like a dog, lay bare the teeth’
 SES: Arosi          sisi               ‘lay bare the teeth, as a dog, grinning’
 NCV: Mota           sis                ‘remove rind or bark; strip off outer part’
 Fij: Bauan          (vaka)sisi(bati)   ‘smile, show the teeth’ (_bati_ ‘tooth’)
>

Blust (ACD) reconstructs both PWMP _*ŋiŋi_ ‘grin, show the teeth’ and PMP _*ŋisi_ ‘grin, show the
teeth’. PMP _*ŋiŋi_ and _*ŋisi_ are evidently the antecedents of POc _*ŋiŋi_ and _*ŋisi_ below. The
data also require the reconstruction of POc _*[ŋi]ŋisa_. Any attempt to combine any two of the
three sets fails, as we are compelled to posit irregular developments, and the existence of non-
Oceanic cognates of both POc _*ŋiŋi_ and POc _*ŋisi_ confirms that both should be reconstructed.
The presence of three formally similar POc terms with the same meaning may appear suspect,
but the evidence requires their reconstruction, even though their reflexes have perhaps been
conflated in some languages. Some reflexes could be attributed to more than one set, and we
have made attributions as best we can on the basis of phonology and glosses.

   The meaning ‘tooth’ could also be attributed to each of these reconstructions, but as there
were other POc terms for teeth (§3.4.12.5) that do not include the sense ‘bare the teeth’, ‘tooth’
may be a secondary meaning that has arisen independently in various daughter-languages.

4.7.3 Weeping and crying

Two sets of POc terms are reconstructed for ‘cry, weep’:

__block__
•   _*taŋis_ (VI) ‘cry, lament etc.’, _*tanis-i-_ (VT) ‘to cry for (s.t.’), _*tanis-aki[ni]-_ ‘cry because of s.t.’
•   _*ŋara(s)_ (VI) ‘cry’, (VT) _*ŋaras-i-_ ‘cry for (s.t.)’

POc _*taŋis_ appears to have been the default term. The glosses of both cognate sets suggest that
their primary meaning had to do with the sound of crying rather than the shedding of tears, and
the glosses of reflexes of POc _*ŋara(s)_ suggest that it denoted weeping accompanied by very
loud crying.

4.7.4 Grunting and moaning

Verbs of grunting, groaning, moaning and the like appear often to be local onomatopoeic
innovations, so that cognate sets barely exist and, even where we find putative cognates, there
is a possibility of independent parallel innovation. It is possible that some members of the set

4.7.5 Goosebumps

No POc reconstruction has been made, but a number of terms for goosebumps have been
collected which identify it with thorns or prickles of plants, barbs of sago leaf or spikes of spiny
fish. The Wayan Fijian and Niuean terms support reconstruction of a Proto Central Pacific
term.

4.7.6 Trembling and shivering

There were a number of POc terms for ‘tremble, shiver’. Six of these fall into three pairs. One
member of each pair has the skeleton _*rVrV_, the other _*drVdrV_. The pairs are _*riri_ (with variant
_*ridriŋ_) and _*dridri_, _*rere_ and _*dredre_ (with variant _*drere_), and _*ruru_ and _*drudru_.[42]

    The fact that there are three pairs of forms is intriguing, and the _*rere_/_*dredre_ and
_*ruru_/_*drudru_ pairs appear to have arisen in POc, perhaps through onomatopoeic wordplay.

    Of these roots, only _*riri_/_*ridriŋ_ has possible non-Oceanic cognates, and its history and
variation in form are discussed in §4.8.1, as it also occurs in terms for ‘be cold’. Suffice it to
say here that the original form of the root was probably POc _*ridriŋ_, but this is reflected in
‘tremble’ forms only in Mangap and Sio. Elsewhere, assimilation has occurred and
widespread reflexes of _*riri_ are found, suggesting that this was already an alternant in POc.
Only Sio and Marshallese reflect _*dridri_.

    The most widely reflected POc term for ‘tremble, shiver’ is _*riri_/_*ridriŋ_. Since this root
also occurred in terms for ‘be cold’, one might infer that its earliest meaning was perhaps
‘shiver’, but the glosses of reflexes below suggest that it was used both for trembling with fear
and for shivering with cold or a fever.

   The POc pair _*rere_ and _*dredre_ ‘tremble, shiver’ appear to be an alternant version of the
pair _*riri_ and _*dridri_. This is plausible formally, as POc _*e_ only reflects PMP _*-ay_, i.e. in
inherited items it occurs only morpheme-finally. Medial POc _*-e-_ is either the outcome of
borrowing from a non-Oceanic language or of idiosyncratic innovation. We suggest that it is
due to the latter here. Nowhere are both _*rere_ and _*riri_ reflected in a single language, and
there is no evident contrast in meaning, beyond the fact that reflexes of _*rere_ have acquired
the meaning ‘fear’ in Bel languages (Bilibil etc.) and in Fijian. The Takia phrase _tini-g i-rer_
‘my skin trembles’ [skin-my it-tremble] shows how the extension of meaning occurred.

   The second member of this pair was apparently POc _*dredre_ (with variant _*drere_), but PPn
_*tete_ raises a question of form. Was its POc ancestor _*dredre_ or _*dede_? By regular sound
change it was _*dede_, but the likely history of the root _*ridriŋ_, reflecting PMP _*diŋdiŋ_ (§4.8.1),
points to POc _*dr_, not _*d_. We cannot resolve this conflict, but note that the POc consonant _*d_
was rare medially and almost non-existent initially, suggesting that _*dredre_ was modified to
_*dede_ in an early Oceanic dialect ancestral to PPn.

4.8         Temperature

    The reconstruction of terms for ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ is tricky, because the English words have a
number of senses for which Oceanic speakers use different words or phrases. The English use
of ‘cold’ to denote a sickness is set aside here. Some Oceanic languages distinguish between

__block__
a.         a person feeling cold (the sense §4.8.1 is concerned with),
b.         a substance being cold to the touch, and
c.         the air, wind or weather being cold.

   Thus in To’aba’ita the terms are (a) _tega_ or _aqai_, (b) _gʷari_, and (c) _ʔoleʔoleʔa_. However,
there is a twist: (a) may also be _gʷa-gʷari_, a reduplicated form of (b) (Lichtenberk 2008).

   In Dobu (a) and (c) are both _gogai_, and (b) is _gonituna_, or _goyuyuwana_ if the cold
substance is water (Lithgow & Lithgow 2006).

   Very few of the available dictionaries differentiate the senses of ‘cold’ as carefully as these
two, so there is a data problem. This is compounded, as seen in both To’aba’ita and Dobu, by
the fact that a term may span two of the three senses. Much the same is true of words for ‘hot’.

# FIXME: How to deal with these "revisions" below?

   A consequence of this is that §§4.8.1–2 are revisions of the section on temperature in
vol. 2:217–218—this despite the fact that those terms were concerned with (b), whereas we are
here concerned with (a). Although it may be assumed that POc made distinctions of the kind
listed above, it is not possible to determine accurately how reconstructed terms for ‘hot’ and
‘cold’ related to (a), (b) and (c).

4.8.1 Feeling cold

There are several POc forms for ‘cold’ which are derived ultimately from PMP _*diŋin_ ‘cold’.
However, Chamorro _maniŋhiŋ_ ‘cold’ reflects PMP _*maN-diŋdiŋ_ (Blust 1970:133), and it can
be assumed that the POc forms reflect the PMP reduplicated root _*diŋdiŋ_. The expected POc
form of the root is _*ridriŋ_, which is plentifully reflected, but this has been subject to
assimilations and perhaps metathesis at various post-POc interstages. The root alone is reflected
as POc _*ridri(ŋ)_, or _*riri(ŋ)_ ‘shiver’ (with assimilation of medial _*-dr-_ to initial _*r-_), discussed
in §7.6.

    Forms for ‘cold’ consist of one of the prefixes _*ma-_, _*maN-_ and _*maka-_ + *ridriŋ, giving
expected POc forms _*ma-ridriŋ_, _*madridriŋ_ (from _*maN-ridriŋ_) and _*maka-ridriŋ_, all of
which are reflected in present-day Oceanic languages. Matters are complicated by the fact that
forms are also found which appear to reflect _*ma-ririŋ_, _*madririŋ_, i.e. with medial _*-dr-_
replaced by _*-r-_. There are several possible explanations of these forms, including
assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis, but these are ignored here as their distribution in the
data suggests that they are local innovations. This means that in a few cases forms reflecting
_*ma-ridriŋ_ may have been attributed to _*madridriŋ_, and vice versa.

    It is possible that the forms here attributed to POc _*madridriŋ_ are actually all reflexes of
_*ma-ridriŋ_ that have undergone assimilation of root-initial _*-r-_ to medial _*dr-_. However, their
wide distribution speaks against this. As _*madridriŋ_ reflects _*maN-ridriŋ_, and _*maN-_ has an
agentive implication, the question arises, How could a term for ‘cold’ be agentive? The answer
is perhaps that it denoted coldness of weather, and there is a sense in which weather can be
regarded as agentive (‘causing shivering’): ‘cold (of weather)’ is the gloss assigned to PMP
_*maN-diŋdiŋ_ by Zorc (2007).

    We take _*ma-ridriŋ_ and _*maka-ridriŋ_ both to have meant ‘feel cold’, but their meanings
may have been wider than this. No semantic difference between them is discernible.

4.8.2 Feeling hot

Three terms are reconstructable for ‘hot, warm’, POc _*[ma]panas_, POc _*maŋini(t)_ and POc
_*tunu-tunu_. The first was probably the general term, to judge from its distribution and its

derived from the verb POc _*tunu_ ‘roast on embers or in fire’ (vol.1:293).

5               Health and disease


5.1      Introduction[1]

Reconstruction of POc terms for diseases carries with it a substantial problem. To the extent
that descriptions of current languages include disease terms at all, they reflect not only the
diseases of the present or near present (such as measles, syphilis, poliomyelitis), but also the
medical knowledge of their compilers. It follows that for this particular semantic field,
linguistics can convey only a broad idea of the health of POc speakers, albeit one that accords
loosely with descriptions given by the first westerners to visit the region.

   Although Portuguese and Spanish explorers had sailed along, and sometimes briefly visited
the north coast of New Guinea from as early as the 16th century, our first reliable information
as to the health of the indigenous inhabitants of mainland New Guinea dates from over three
hundred years later when Miklukho-Maclay, in 1871, apparently the first white person seen by
the natives of Astrolabe Bay on the north New Guinea coast, noted in his diary: ‘Of these eight
Papuans of my first meeting, four appeared sick. Two had legs disfigured by elephantiasis, and
one was an interesting case of psoriasis, which had spread over his entire body. The back and
neck of the fourth was studded with boils, which formed large, hard protuberances and on his
face were several scars, probably of previous such boils’ (1975:19). Later he mentioned that a
native from Bilibil complained very much of a pain in the back and shoulders (probably
rheumatism) (p.83). He also noted that ‘Digu’s face [one of the first local people to befriend
him] bore traces of smallpox. He explained to me that the illness came from the north-west
and that many died from it. When it happened and whether it happened more than once, I was
not able to find out.’ (p.91).

   Other information on the health of early Oceanic populations may be derived from skeletal
remains. Our best evidence at present comes from the remains of 36 individuals, 29 of them
adult, found at Teouma, Vanuatu, dated to ca. 3100–3000 BP (Buckley et. al. 2008), i.e. very
soon after the initial dispersal of Proto Oceanic speakers. Examination of these skeletons
indicates that in addition to dental caries, three quarters of the sample suffered from
degenerative joint disease (p.97). ‘Because populations were probably small, chronic
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and yaws are unlikely to have been present’ (p.91).
Nonetheless, the authors add that ‘the types of rib lesions observed in the Teouma samples are
frequently observed in pulmonary tuberculosis sufferers … but can also be caused by other
respiratory conditions such as pneumonia and bronchitis’ (p.109). In a separate article Hallie
Buckley (2007:747) argues that erosive arthritis noted in six of these individuals may be
evidence of gout.

[1] Thanks are due to Malcolm Ross who has made numerous additions to the data, and to Matthew
    Spriggs for advice on current findings on skeletal remains in Vanuatu.

5.2     Concept of illness

As described in a number of early Melanesian ethnographies (Romilly 1889, Codrington 1891,
Seligman 1910, Fortune 1932, Powdermaker 1933, Wedgwood 1934), illness and death were
formerly (and in places still are) seen as the result of sorcery, performed because of some
perceived transgression by the sufferer. However, there is considerable variation in the degree
to which sorcery is implicated in any given condition, in the ways in which it is practised, and
the methods by which it may be counteracted.

   Ian Hogbin (1978:47) describes beliefs held in Wogeo, one of the Schouten Islands off the
north New Guinea coast. According to his informants, nothing in Wogeo happens by chance:
sorcery is believed to be implicated even in minor illnesses. He writes:

__blockquote__
      Everybody can list a score or more of common ailments such as headache, toothache, boils,
      indigestion, nausea, diarrhoea, fainting attacks, sore throat, bronchitis, strained muscles, and
      fever. …To the Wogeo the cause lies in a mild form of sorcery, differing from that leading to
      death, and relief demands the performance of beneficient magic to counteract the evil. …
      Each of the diseases has an associated ritual system, with spells to induce the complaint and
      spells to cure it.

Hogbin adds that even succumbing to snakebite or a serious accident is attributed to sorcery
(1978:51), although he exempts the deaths of infants and those already senile (p.54). However,
in earlier writing he attributes the deaths of small infants to spirits stealing their souls, while
deaths of adults after protracted illness are put down to breaches of religious taboos (1934:328).

   To the Manam Islander as described by Camilla Wedgwood (1934:64-65),

__blockquote__
      Minor illnesses which are more or less endemic and from which the patient easily recovers,
      such as colds, coughs and mild attacks of fever, are often lightly dismissed as natural,
      _imore baia_ (“he is just ill”) they will say, or their attitude might be more accurately represented by
      saying that, because such ailments are common, of brief duration and show none of the signs
      which are regarded as serious, the natives do not trouble about their cause. But if a person is
      seriously ill or is suffering from some abnormality such as lunacy, physical deformity or bad
      sores which will not respond to treatment, such a departure from the normal condition of
      good health is believed to be due to a supernatural agency.

    Ann Chowning (1989:222) describes the situation among the Kove, in west New Britain.
Here, serious diseases in older children and adults, as well as their deaths from a variety of
immediate causes such as accidents, tended to be attributed to sorcery. An exception was death
or injury in warfare. The death or sudden illness of young children was usually attributed to
attack by spirits, either a ghost of dead kin angry with the child’s parents or a spirit of non-
human origin whose territory had been intruded upon by the parents. A similar belief among
the Longgu speakers in the southeast Solomons has been noted by Hogbin (1964:58), who
writes that ‘when a youngster under the age of about five succumbs the parents are prepared to
accept a verdict of “just the sickness of a child”, resulting from a ghost’s having played with
him or her. But all other deaths (including those from what we would call bad luck) are
attributed to black magic’.

    Hortense Powdermaker (1933:293) writes that in Lesu, on the east coast of New Ireland,
death, unless it has some obvious cause, such as falling from a tree or drowning, or unless it
happens in old age, is thought to be due to black magic. Illness may be due to magic or more
natural causes.

336 Meredith Osmond

    A major problem experienced by early ethnographers in obtaining information on all
matters connected with sorcery and magic was the natural reticence of the locals when it came
to discussing secret and mysterious processes with strangers. Missionaries in particular could
be expected to discourage any such beliefs as incompatible with Christianity. In British New
Guinea from the 1880’s on, there was also a very real fear of the results of government
interference, for sorcery became an indictable offence (Seligman 1910:278). Similar reticence
has been noted elsewhere. It may take years for an outsider living within a community to be
allowed to know of such matters. Raymond Firth who spent a year in Tikopia in 1928-9, learnt
much later that the chiefs had given orders that he was to be told nothing about their gods and
ritual practices (1957:8).

    Spells whose purpose is to cause illness or death, and conversely, to aid in recovery, are
typically guarded jealously, sometimes handed down from generation to generation, at other
times able to be bought (Wedgwood 1934:292). Terms for these may themselves carry power
and will be used with great caution. Consequently, our knowledge of such practices as they
apply to the cause of disease and its treatment and eventual outcome is patchy, to say the least,
and an area in which comparative linguistics can play very little part. As I have found, the only
terms to do with disease and healing likely to be recorded by wordlist compilers are those
referring to natural processes or actions. Almost all reconstructions are restricted to the
physical manifestations of disease and healing.

    The following sections present reconstructions of POc terms for diseases and healing.
Higher level reconstructions are included if known, most from Blust’s Austronesian
Comparative Dictionary (ACD).


5.3     Illnesses and afflictions

5.3.1 General terms

Of the three general terms reconstructed, POc _*masaki(t)_ (V) ‘be in pain, sick’; (N) ‘sickness’ is
the most inclusive in meaning, applicable both to illnesses and other afflictions. In southeast
Solomonic languages its reflexes have come to have specific reference to feverish illness,
particularly malaria.

The following set is an apparent PWOc variant of POc _*masa(k,q)i(t)_ with the vowel sequence
moving from _a-a-i_ to _a-i-i_, and _-s-_ replaced with _-j-_. Both contain the stative prefix _*ma-_.
Lukep, W Kara and Nalik terms below could reflect either POc root _*jiki_ or _*siki_, while the
Bali (without prefix) and Bola terms reflect only _*jiqi_.

  Reflexes of PAn _*maCay_, PMP _*matay_ ‘die, dead’ (§4.2.1.2) carry a number of extended
meanings. POc _*mate_, sometimes reduplicated, evidently included among its meanings ‘be
weak or ill’, ‘be motionless, be unconscious’, ‘be paralysed’. As a result, if the meaning ‘dead’
is intended, some qualification is usually required, e.g. Sa’a _mae ʔoto_ ‘quite dead’, Manam
_imate tina_ ‘dead + intensifier’.

                                                                       Health and disease 339


    The antonym of both POc _*[ma]sakit_ and stative POc _*mate_ was evidently POc _*maqurip_
‘be in good health, be alive’ (§4.2.1.1).

5.3.2 Painful skin conditions

Listed next are a number of terms that refer to skin conditions—first the painful infections that
include tropical ulcers, abscesses and boils. The large number of reconstructions no doubt
reflects the commonplace nature of these conditions, and indicates that a more specialised POc
vocabulary existed for them. However, dictionary definitions do not provide enough
information for us to distinguish between, for instance, terms for boil or infected scratch or
wound or tropical ulcer, or perhaps terms that might indicate the severity of the infection. All
reconstructions are nouns bar POc _*makini(t)_ ‘to be stung, have a stinging pain’, which may
have been the verb used to describe an insect sting

5.3.2.1 Boil, ulcer, wound

POc _*manuka_ below reflects PAn _*ma-Luka_/PMP _*ma-nuka_, meaning ‘wounded’. In POc it
has become a general term for a sore. However, unprefixed PAn _*Luka_/PMP _*luka_ became the
POc term for yaws (§5.3.4).

   The following reconstruction appears to be the same term as POc _*buku_, glossed in vol.1
(p85) as ‘node (as in bamboo or sugarcane); joint; knuckle; knot in wood, string or rope’, in
vol.2 (p51) as ‘hill’, and in §3.6.8.1.2 as ‘mound, knob, joint’, where it was noted that the term
focussed on the shape of the referent rather than on what it was. In the present instance it
denotes a swollen lump on the skin, and a number of reflexes are also used as a verb ‘swell’.
However, the alternation between _b-_ and _p-_ across reflexes remains unexplained.

5.3.2.4 Itching

Two formally similar but unrelated reconstructions found elsewhere, POc _*kaRat-i_ ‘to
bite’ (§4.3.5.1) and POc _*karak_ ‘ringworm, itch’ (§5.3.3.2 below) each have scattered reflexes
meaning ‘itch’. Their cognate sets listed below have been limited here to those reflexes with
‘itch’ meanings. It is possible that the loss of POc final consonants in many languages and the
close association between (insect) ‘bite’ and ‘itch’ resulted in some conflation of reflexes so
that the Kaiwa, Numbami and the EOc reflexes of POc _*kaRat_ added to their meaning the
‘itch’ sense of _*karak_.

   Dictionary-makers of Papua New Guinea languages tend to attribute reflexes of POc
_*kʷasi-kʷasi_ below to borrowing from Tok Pisin _kaskas_ ‘scabies’. Some reflexes may indeed
have a Tok Pisin origin, but the presence of Polynesian reflexes indicate (a) that POc
_*kʷasi-kʷasi_ should be reconstructed, and (b) that an Oceanic language is the source of Tok Pisin
_kaskas_. The Polynesian reflexes indicate that PPn _*kasi_ denoted scrofula, eruptions around the
neck caused by a bacterial infection of local lymph nodes, but this shift in denotation is not a
surprising one, as scabies also causes skin eruptions.

[5] Blust (ACD) reconstructs PAn _*karut_ ‘scrape, rasp’, but the Formosan reflexes mean ‘rake’. The ACD’s
    Malayo-Polynesian reflexes, however, appear to be cognate with the POc term reconstructed here (Isneg
    _kárut_ ‘sharpen the edge of a tool by means of another blade’, Cebuano _kalút_ ‘scratch an itch’, Malay
    _karut_ ‘rasp’). Hence we reconstruct to PMP rather than PAn.

5.3.3.2 Ringworm, tinea imbricata

The English term ‘ringworm’ is a misnomer, as the skin infections it labels are caused by fungi.
One of these is _Tinea imbricata_, found mainly in and around the Pacific, and caused by the
fungus _Trichophyton concentricum_. It appears as an eruption of concentric rings of overlapping
scales which often covers much of the sufferer’s body. The main POc term for _Tinea imbricata_
was _*puni_, which reflects a sound change discussed in §1.3.4.2.

   Proto Malaita-Makira (SES) _*garat-a_ ‘ringworm’ looks superficially like an irregular development
from POc _*karak_ above, but this is probably a chance resemblance. The form _*garat-a_ is a
nominalisation with _*-a_ (< POc _*-aŋ_) of a root reflected without nominalisation in To’aba’ita
_ma-gara_ (VI) ‘be covered with sores or a skin condition such as scabies’. Its POc antecedent
would be †_*garas_, for which we have no other evidence.

5.3.3.3 Tinea versicolor alias pityriasis versicolor or tinea flava

Tinea versicolor is known as ‘white spot’ across much of Melanesia. Caused by the yeast
_Malassezia globosa_, the infection leads to skin eruptions. These result in pigmentary changes in
people with dark skin tones that leave lighter patches of skin. The POc term for white spot,
supported by non-Oceanic cognates as far away as the Philippines, was _*pano_, but reflected in
just a few Oceanic languages. Recorded under ‘cf. also’ below are Papuan Tip terms that appear

disqualified as a reflex by its initial _t-_, was probably borrowed from a reflex in another
(unidentified) Guadalcanal language. If so, the reconstruction would be raised to PEOc. The

5.3.4 Yaws (Framboesia)

Yaws is considered to be among the earliest diseases known to man,[6] and must have been
present among Austronesian speakers prior to their movement into the Pacific. The disease
occurs in tropical regions and begins as an inflammatory lesion through which bacteria enter
the body as a result of direct contact with an already infected person. The disease manifests
itself in the form of raspberry-like nodules on the skin which may become deep open sores, and
in severe cases, result in facial scars and bone deformity. It is common among children who
typically develop sores around the mouth and anus, but confers a degree of immunity so that
secondary, more crippling stages that can result in bone lesions are more likely in those whose
first exposure is as adults (McNeill 1976:177, 218). Once widespread in New Guinea, yaws is
now almost totally eradicated, and terms for the condition have largely fallen into disuse within
the last fifty or so years.

    Languages in the region would no doubt have had a number of terms for the different
stages of yaws and for the disease as it affects different parts of the body. (Babatana terms
include _tapae sua_ ‘secondary yaws - ulcers’ (_tapa_ ‘ulcer’, _sua_ ‘child’), _boka_ ‘yaws affecting
mouth and chin’, _ŋore_ ‘yaws affecting the nose’, _maqoqele_ ‘yaws affecting bone’ and so on.)
A number of terms have been located for the raspberry-like nodules once commonly found in
children (PCP _*tona_ ‘skin blemishes caused by yaws’), while some cognates included under
reconstructions for painful skin conditions above, such as in POc _*manuka_, ‘ulcer, sore,
wound’ (§5.3.2.1), may refer to these sores. Indeed, the unprefixed form of this term, PAn
_*Luka_/PMP _*luka_, gave rise to POc _*luka_, the term for yaws. Oceanic reflexes are restricted
to the Southeast Solomonic subgroup, but the existence of non-Oceanic cognates (Banggai
(wMP) _nuka_, Selaru (CMP) _nua_ [ACD]) with this sense supports the POc reconstruction. The
loss of the first _*-k-_ of Proto Southeast Solomonic _*luka-luka_ reflects a regular reduplication
process (Andrew Pawley, pers. comm.).

[6] Analysis of Homo erectus skeletal remains suggests the disease yaws had its origins in Middle Pleistocene
    Africa 1.5 million years ago (Mark Rose 1996, Yaws origin. In Newsbrief 49(3), report of the Archaeological
    Institute of America (www.archaeology.org/9605/newsbriefs/yaws.html).

5.3.5 Fever, malaria

Was malaria endemic among the speakers of Proto Oceanic? Linguistics does not provide an
answer to this question. Reconstructions carry glosses no more precise than ‘be hot’, ‘be cold’,
‘tremble’, ‘shiver’ and so on, conditions which have a range of causes but are symptoms of
malaria. Nor is the malaria-carrying mosquito found in Micronesia, New Caledonia, Fiji or
Polynesia. Proto Malaita-Makira _*mataki_ ‘malaria, to have malaria’ is reconstructable, but this
is a reflex of POc _*masakit_ ‘be sick’ (§5.3.1), the specific reference to malaria apparently
limited to the southeast Solomons. There are today two main strains of malaria in New Guinea,
transmitted by Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum by way of certain species of the Anopheles
mosquito. P. vivax can lodge in the liver, causing a relapse up to two years after the initial
infection, and can be easily transported with its human hosts. It is considered to be of Southeast
Asian rainforest origin, and, where it is long-established in a stable population, can result in a
degree of tolerance in its victims (Groube 1993:168, 171). Groube, a prehistorian, writes
(p.169) that ‘it would be incredible, considering the proximity of Southeast Asia (the possible
homeland of P. vivax), if this parasite was not introduced [to New Guinea] before the end of the
Pleistocene.’ P. falciparum, on the other hand, is of African origin. The resultant illness,
although non-relapsing, is more virulent than that transmitted by P. vivax. As the parasite
cannot survive within its host beyond the duration of its initial infection, it requires large host
populations moving rapidly for successful migration. It is considered a latecomer to Melanesia,
its arrival ‘unlikely to have been much before a thousand years ago’ (p.168), i.e. more than two
thousand years after the initial dispersal of Proto Oceanic speakers.

                                                                        Health and disease 351

    Almost all verbs in the data with the meaning ‘be ill with malaria’ are from SES or NCV
languages. They are either from POc _*malaso_ ‘be cold’ (Gela _malaho_ ‘cold, chill; to be cold,
chilly; malaria, to be ill with malaria’, Lo-Toga _mela_ ‘cold, fever, malaria’) or POc _*riri_/_*rere_
‘tremble, shiver’, variants of POc _*ma-ridriŋ_ ‘(s.o.) cold’. For supporting evidence see §4.7.6
and §4.8.1.

5.3.6 Rheumatism, arthritis

A single POc reconstruction is proposed for ‘inflammation of joints’, _*ŋu-ŋu(l)_. Although
Oceanic cognates are all Polynesian, the existence of a PMP reconstruction _*ŋu-ŋul_ ‘arthritic or
rheumatic pain’ indicates that there was a POc reflex. Instances of gout, a disease evidently
suffered by Austronesian populations from Taiwan to Polynesia (Buckley 2007) are in places
identified by this term.

5.3.7 Asthma, breathlessness

Asthma was probably not recognised as a sickness by pre-modern Oceanic speakers, who
referred to it by terms for breathlessness. Two POc terms are reconstructed, _*oŋa(p)_ and _*ŋaRa_
(for discussion see §4.5.2). A PPn term, _*sela_, is also reconstructable.

5.3.8 Coughing

The English term is vague, referring to anything from throat-clearing to severe paroxysms.
Perhaps the POc terms were more specific. Two POc terms, _*koso_ (VI), _koso-ŋa_ (N) and
_*puku(R)_/Proto Remote Oceanic _*puRuk_, both glossed ‘cough’, have been reconstructed: for cognate sets see
§4.5.7.

5.3.9 Diarrhoea

Oceanic languages often describe diarrhoea in descriptive or euphemistic terms (cf. English
‘trots’, ‘runs’), like these three PT languages: Bunama _gamʷa-pili_ [stomach-run], Dobu
_diya-salisali_ [intestine-rot/melt], Iamalele _kamo taitai-na_ [stomach landslide-its]. Similarly Sye (SV)
_ne-vcah norari_ [the-faeces flow].

    Nonetheless, two monomorphemic POc reconstructions have been made, _*surup_ and, less
secure, _*sana_. Reflexes of the first are well distributed.

   Terms for dysentery are typically compounds that include a term for ‘blood’: Gedaged
_tae daɬ_ [excrement blood]; Roviana _pea ehara_ [defecate blood]; Gela _suru gabu_, Tongan
_hana toto_, Samoan _sana toto_ [diarrhoea blood].

5.3.10 Vomiting

Two POc reconstructions for the verb ‘vomit’, _*mʷutaq_ and _*luaq_, are well-supported, each
having antecedents at least as far back as PMP. They are discussed in §4.4.4.

5.3.11 Swelling, elephantiasis

Although swelling is a symptom of a wide range of afflictions, wordlists tend to single out one
particular highly visible form, elephantiasis. This is the term given to gross swelling of parts of
the body, typically legs or scrotum, a late-stage, chronic condition of filariasis. The disease is
caused by nematode parasites in the lymph glands of the body, and is transmitted via various
species of mosquito including Anopheles, the species also responsible for malaria transmission.
Early stages of the disease are often accompanied by severe rigor and fever, and may be
mistaken for malaria. Elephantiasis is present in the entire Oceanic region, including Polynesia
and Micronesia. The particular form of filaria found in most of Oceania (due to Wuchereria
bancrofti) is also widely distributed through the warmer parts of Asia (Sasa 1976).

    One reconstruction, POc _*pʷiRa_, refers specifically to elephantiasis. POc _*tubuq_ is a generic
term meaning ‘to swell’, but may be compounded with the relevant body-part term, such as a
reflex of POc _*qaqe_ ‘leg’ or _*laso_ ‘testicles’ to refer to elephantiasis.

    POc _*pʷiRa_ is reconstructed, rather than _*puRa_, to account for the numerous reflexes that
do not undergo the lenition of the initial consonant that is expected of _*p-_ but not of _pʷ-_.

[7]  Samoans may refer to a leg swollen by elephantiasis as _vae-tupa_. Stair (1983:170) translates this as ‘crab-
     claw leg’, from vae ‘leg’, tupa ‘a species of land crab with very large claws’. This may be a folk etymology.
     Curiously, the disease may also be called _feʔe-feʔe_ (_feʔe_ ‘octopus’).

5.3.12 Epilepsy

Although no POc reconstruction for epilepsy has been made, a number of clues suggest that the
convulsions of an epileptic fit were seen as similar to the sudden movements of some birds. For
instance, Sa’a has a term _kokoko_ which refers to ‘a bird, the megapode’ and also to ‘a disease
and its convulsions, so called in allusion to the startled movements of the megapode when
discovered’. Tongan has a term _mahaki-moa_ ‘to be epileptic’ (_mahaki_ ‘illness’, _moa_ ‘fowl’).
Wayan Fijian uses a similar metaphor, _manumanu-ni-soni_ (_manu_ ‘flying creature’, _soni_ ‘vine
used to trap bats, which struggle to get free’). Two manu terms from SES languages, Arosi
_manu_ and ’Are’are _manu susuru_ (_susuru_ ‘?’) also mean ‘epilepsy’.

5.3.13 Eye disorders

Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP doublets for ‘cataract’, _*bileR_ and _*bulaR_, both of which appear
to have Oceanic reflexes. which have broadened their meaning to include sight impairments
and blindness generally and have acquired the additional sense ‘close one’s eyes’. The latter is
used as a metaphor for blindness in various WOc languages, e.g. Mangap _mata- i-pis_, Takia
_mala- i-tau_, both [eye- it-closed] ‘blind’.

>

    Oceanic languages frequently use a reflex of _*mata-_ ‘eye’ with a range of modifiers to refer
to various eye conditions including cataracts, squinting, conjuctivitis, trachoma and
undifferentiated blindness. For the latter, typical compounds are ‘eye’ + ‘closed’ (see above)
and ‘eye’ + ‘night/dark’, although no bimorphic reconstruction has been possible. Pukapukan,
for instance, has _matapō_ ‘blind’ (from POc _*mata-_ + _*boŋi_ ‘night/dark’). To’aba’ita has
_mā-rodoa_ ‘any serious eye condition that prevents good vision’, and Lau has _mā-rodo_
‘blind’ (both from POc _*mata-_ + _*rodrom_ ‘be dark, be night’).

5.3.14 Deafness and dumbness

The PMP antecedent of POc _*tuli_ evidently referred to ‘earwax’, but the POc cognates extend

>

    The inability to speak that is commonly associated with deafness is in some communities
also considered a sign of mental deficiency or stupidity. Note the glosses of the Kiriwina item
in the _*tuli_ set, the Ramoaaina item in the *boŋol set and the Kaulong item in the _*pʷapo_ set.
Examples from other languages include Yabem _meloʔ_ ‘insane, dull, foolish, deaf and dumb,
epileptic’, Tawala _bade-bade_ ‘insane, deaf and dumb, naked’, Kiriwina _nagowa_ ‘deaf, dumb,
insane’. Tolai _beg-beg_ ‘deaf, dumb; fool, idiot’, Arosi _bweu_ ‘be foolish, stupid, thick-witted,
deaf and dumb’, ’Are’are _peu_ ‘dull, foolish, idiotic, insane, be in a trance, be deaf and dumb’.

5.3.15 Tooth decay and toothache

There is a widespread belief among Austronesian speakers that dental caries is caused by a
small worm. Both the creature and the associated condition are named in different languages by
reflexes of various reconstructed terms for ‘worm’. Blust comments on two WMP languages,
Cebuano and Malagasy, whose reflexes of PAn _*qulej_ ‘maggot’ refer also to ‘tooth decay’ or
‘toothache, supposed to be occasioned by a small worm in the tooth’ (ACD). Other wMP
languages refer to tooth decay by reflexes of PMP _*bukbuk_ ‘weevil that infests wood, bamboo,
and rice; dust produced by the boring of this insect; tooth decay’ (ACD). Dobu (PT) has a term
_kimʷata_ ‘the supposed insect which causes caries in children’, from _mʷata_ ‘snake’. The
To’aba’ita (SES) term is _wā-lifo_ ‘tooth decay, believed to be caused by worms’ (_wā_ ‘worm,
grub, maggot, caterpillar, larva’, _lifo_ ‘tooth’). Codrington also reports the belief as existing in
the Banks Islands (NCV), but gives no terms (1891:193).

    In some languages toothache is referred to simply by a compound, ‘tooth’ + ‘pain’ or
similar.

5.3.16 Giddiness

Cognates from Seimat and Tolai support POc _*ta-lili_ ‘(be) dizzy’ (PMP _*ta-_ SPONTANEOUS;
§1.3.5.4) while Polynesian cognates support PPn _*lili-ka_ (POc _*-ka_ adjective formative). Other
terms reflect _*lili_ in combination with still other affixes. Western Micronesian languages reflect
a stem _*aliali_, which presumably arose as a variant of _*lili_.

5.3.17 Club-footed

Club foot is a relatively common congenital deformity whereby the affected foot appears to
have been rotated internally at the ankle. It is seen rarely in western communities because it is
successfully treated in early childhood, but without treatment people with club feet often appear
to walk on their ankles or on the sides of their feet.

In §5.3.14 it was noted that the inability to speak that is commonly associated with deafness is
in some communities considered a sign of mental deficiency or stupidity. Communities will

reflexes are not widely distributed, POc _*ŋau_ ‘crazy’ can be reconstructed. PPn _*fasa_ ‘mad,
crazy’ is also reconstructable.

5.4.2 Assisted healing

Just as communities attributed some illnesses to natural processes and others to the result of
sorcery, so their treatments dealt with both magical and practical aspects of the condition, and
the two are sometimes difficult to separate. Practical treatment may have included application
of herbal remedies both by ingestion and in external use, and massage. Focus here is on the
physical treatment given, rather than on investigation and removal of the cause.

    Ways of effecting treatment were multiple, varying from place to place and with the nature
of the ailment, although some commonality is evident.

5.4.2.1 Spraying masticated substances on to affected part

The spraying of some masticated substance such as ginger mixed with saliva from the mouth
on to an affected body part is evidently a very old and widely practised treatment right across
the Austronesian world. Blust lists, in addition to numerous cognates of PAn _*buReS_ that carry
a general meaning ‘spray water from the mouth’, terms from Cebuano and Sundanese (wMP),
Asilulu, Kamarian and Boano (CMP) that carry a meaning of spraying something from the
mouth for the specific purpose of healing (ACD). In Oceanic communities we have descriptions
of similar treatment from Manam (Wedgwood 1934), Nakanai (Chowning 2014), and Gela
(Codrington 1891). Although POc _*puRas_ ‘spray water from the mouth’ can be reconstructed,
a second term, POc _*puRuk_, similar but apparently unrelated, has wider support.

5.4.2.2 Massage

Another form of treatment involved massage, the purpose of which may have been location
and removal of an offending substance (Romilly 1889 for Motu,[8] Codrington 1891 for Banks
Islands) or simply to ease a person’s pain or discomfort (Codrington 1891 for Gela, Whistler
1996 for Samoa). It became more highly developed in Fiji and Polynesia. Wayan Fijian, for
example, has at least seven terms describing different kinds of massage such as massage by
stroking, by kneading, with fingers, with palm of hand and so on (Pawley and Sabaya 2003).

    POc _*samo(s)_, _*samos-i-_ ‘massage, stroke’ has few but well distributed reflexes. PROc
_*amosi_ seems to reflect the same item with unexpected loss of _*s-_, while most NCV terms
reflect loss of the initial syllable.

   However, ordinary non-specialised vocabulary may carry a more technical meaning in the
context of healing. As Biggs reports for the language of East Futuna, in ordinary speech _vai_,
_mili_, _tuluʔi_, _kisu_ mean ‘water’, ‘rub’, ‘drip, ‘spit out’ respectively. In the context of healing,
they take on the technical meanings of ‘medicine to be drunk’, ‘embrocation’, ‘medicinal
drops’, and ‘spraying chewed up medicinal leaves from the mouth’ (Biggs 1995:120).

5.4.2.3 Use of plants

The role of plants in the treatment of illness is not dealt with here, but there is evidence
that plants such as ginger (POc _*laqia_, vol.3:414), and dracaena (POc _*jiRi_, vol.3:418)
were in widespread use, together with lime (POc _*qapu(R)_), vol.2:64). See also Ross
(2008) for more detailed discussion on the role of plants in the treatment of illness.


5.5     Conclusion

Specific POc terms have been reconstructed for a few visible or otherwise readily recognisable
disorders – for boils and tropical ulcers, for skin conditions now identifiable as tinea or scabies,
for inflammation of joints, for eye conditions like cataracts, and for diseases with very specific
visible characteristics like elephantiasis. Reconstructions for a number of behavioural verbs – to
shiver, cough, vomit, (none of which necessarily indicate the presence of disease), and states
such as itching are included in chapter 4. Terms that refer to pain in particular parts of the body
tend to be compounds along the lines of English earache, toothache, headache, stomachache
and so on. However, no fossilised reconstructable compounds have been found, but rather lists
of transparent descriptions, with elements that vary slightly but are close in meaning. Wordlist
compilers may simply not see the need to include such descriptions.

    More detailed information on the range and severity of illnesses present in early Oceanic-speaking
populations will be dependent on the findings of other disciplines. Further analysis
of the Lapita skeletal remains from Teouma, Vanuatu, may provide evidence of diseases such
as tuberculosis. Epidemiologists may be able to tell us more about the behaviour of the various
strains of diseases such as malaria and elephantiasis, the size of populations necessary for
transmission, and the degree of immunity some people may have or acquire. Diseases that
were not known to POc society are those where we have some record of their introduction.
From the end of the 18th century, parts of the Pacific were increasingly exposed to contact by
missionaries, whalers, traders in search of sandalwood, pearlshell, tortoiseshell and beche-de-mer,
and escaped convicts from Botany Bay, all potentially carrying transmissible diseases.
The local people had no resistance, and therefore had apparently received no prior exposure to
such diseases as influenza, whooping cough, measles, mumps, chicken pox, syphilis and
gonorrhoea. Diseases such as leprosy, smallpox and tuberculosis which were known
throughout much of the world from very early times, were probably introduced much earlier,
but whether they were present at the time of the breakup of POc I cannot say.




6                Posture and movement

6.1      Introduction

The reconstructions presented in this chapter cover a wide semantic range of verbs concerned
with posture and movement. The semantic domain is a complex one, and the reader will find
more reference to the typological literature than in other chapters in these volumes, in an
effort to make sense of the domain’s structure in Proto Oceanic. Languages structure the
posture and movement domain in different ways, and Oceanic languages have their own
shared peculiarities in this regard, described at appropriate points in the chapter.

   The most important division is into posture verbs and movement verbs. Posture verbs in
turn are divided into cardinal posture verbs—those denoting ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’, found in
most languages around the world and often used as simple verbs of location (‘be at’)—and
non-cardinal posture verbs, which are more culturally specific. The subdomain of movement
verbs is much more complex. There are straightforward movement verbs like ‘go’, ‘fly’ and
‘descend’ (§§6.3–6.5), which have a single argument, the theme (the person or thing that is
moved), and there are caused movement verbs like ‘raise’, ‘carry’, ‘put’ and ‘send’, which
have two arguments: an agent that causes movement and a theme which moves. These
complexities are discussed at greater length below.


6.2      Posture verbs

Posture verbs are verbs meaning ‘sit’, ‘stand’, ‘lie’, ‘hang’, ‘lean’, ‘squat’, ‘kneel’ and the like.
These can be divided into cardinal and non-cardinal posture verbs. Cardinal posture verbs
have the meanings ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’ and have a broader range of use in many languages
than non-cardinal posture verbs, i.e. verbs denoting other postures (‘hang’ etc) and verbs
denoting a more specific posture (e.g. ‘sit crosslegged’) than the cardinal posture verbs.

    The cardinal posture verbs ‘sit’, ‘stand’ and ‘lie’ have two kinds of use in many of the
world’s languages, including Oceanic. In the first use they are simply intransitive verbs
denoting the posture of their subject (‘Mary is sitting’). They are often accompanied by a
location (‘Mary is sitting on a chair’). This gives rise to their second use, as default verbs in
locative constructions (Ameka & Levinson 2007, Lichtenberk 2002). A locative construction
is one that answers the question ‘Where is X?’. Across languages locative constructions come
in three main kinds:[1]

__block__
 1. a construction with no copula (‘The cup — on the table’)
 2. a construction with a copula verb corresponding to English be (‘The cup is on the table’),
 3. a construction with a posture verb (‘The cup sits on the table’. ‘The vase stands on the
    table’).

[1] This is a simplified version of Ameka & Levinson’s (2007) categorisation, which see for more detail.

368 Malcolm Ross


Oceanic languages tend to have constructions of types 1 and 3, but not type 2. The Seimat
(Adm) sentence below is of type 1:[2]

__igt__
Tok      mom          hahitak-e         tehu     iŋ.
CLF      chicken      under-CSTR        CLF      house
‘The chicken [is] under the house.’ (Wozna & Wilson 2005:66)

   The difference between a postural and a locative use is that in the latter, the verb is
bleached of its postural meaning. Thus Manam (NNG) has a type 3 locative construction
where the verb _-eno_ ‘lie’ is used in locative and existential sentences[3] with abstract subjects
where there is no postural orientation at all.

__igt__
Malipi       di-eno,      masa         n-duma-iʔo.
work         S:3P-lie     INDEF.IRR    s:1S.IRR-help-O:2S
‘If there is work, I’ll help you.’ (Lichtenberk 2002:277)

__igt__
More       ilo-gu-lo                i-eno.
sickness inner. belly-P:1S-in s:3S.REAL-lie
‘I’m sick in the belly.’ (Lit. ‘The sickness is in my belly.’) (Lichtenberk 2002:277)

With a human subject, on the other hand, _-soaʔi_ ‘sit’ is used in a locative sentence, again with
no postural implication:

__igt__
Barasi rua ŋau          taun-lo u-soaʔi.
year     two I          town-in s:1S.REAL-sit
‘Two years I was/stayed/lived in the town.’ (Lichtenberk 2002:275)

The choice of _-eno_ ‘lie’, rather than _-soaʔi_, with a human subject is clearly a postural usage.

__igt__
Kadiaraŋ maka bale              ne-na-lo i-eno              be i-tan~taŋ.
K.        here men’s. house     CLF -P:3S -in S:3S.REAL-lie and s:3S.REAL-REDUP-cry
‘Kadiarang is lying in his house (and is) crying.’ (Lichtenberk 2002:274)

As these Manam examples show, the choice of posture verb depends on two factors. The first
is whether the intended construction is locative or postural. If it is locative, then the second
factor comes into play, namely the conventional collocation of particular nouns or semantic
categories of nouns with a given posture verb. These collocations vary from language to
language and almost always involve ‘sit’, ‘stand’ or ‘lie’ (Lichtenberk 2002:273–274, 305;
see also Early 2000). Non-cardinal posture verbs almost never occur in a locative
construction.

   The three main posture verbs are also often used as aspectual verbs in Oceanic languages,
usually as the second verb of a serial verb construction, but Lichtenberk (2002:270) thinks
these meanings are impossible to reconstruct (and I agree with him) as different languages
reflect different developments. He also thinks that reconstructing uses of posture verbs as
default locative verbs is impossible. Here I am a little more sanguine (§6.2.1).

[2] Abbreviations in these examples are as follows: ASP aspect marker, CLF classifier, INDEF indefinite, IRR
    irrealis, REAL realis; ~ connects reduplicates.

[3] Oceanic existential constructions tend to be similar to locative constructions, with the one difference that
    their subject is indefinite (e.g. ‘A cat is sitting under me’ = ‘There is a cat sitting under me). For present
    purposes, existential constructions are treated as a subtype of locative construction, as in the first Manam
    example below.

                                                                                 Posture and movement 369


    Typically in Oceanic languages intransitive verbs encode both posture and assumption of
posture (inchoative posture). The latter use is sometimes distinguished by a path element
meaning ‘upward’ or ‘downward’. Path was probably encoded in POc as the second verb of a
serial verb construction, as in Mussau _toka sio_ ‘sit down’ and _tiŋina sae_ ‘stand up’, where _sio_
‘go down’ and _sae_ ‘go up’ are verbs of vertical direction (vol.2:260-267). Such usages were
certainly conventionalised in POc and were perhaps also grammaticised, like Manam
_go-soaʔi-ria_ [2SG. IRR-sit-go. down] ‘sit down’ (Lichtenberk 2002:269-270) or Carolinian
_sɔ̄-tiw_ [settle-go. down] ‘alight, land (of flying things)’.

    Some Oceanic languages have transitives with a location object, e.g. Bugotu _mono_ ‘abide,
stay, dwell, be at’ vs _monoŋ-i-_ ‘abide in’; To’aba’ita _ʔono_ ‘sit’ vs _ʔonof-i-_ ‘sit on’
(Lichtenberk 2002:269), Wayan _toko_ ‘squat; sit on one’s heels or haunches’ vs _tokoði-_ ‘squat or sit on’. Our
sources are often silent on this matter, but there are sometimes enough reflexes to support the
reconstruction of transitives.

    In addition to cardinal posture verbs, verbs meaning ‘squat’, ‘kneel’ and ‘hang’ can be
reconstructed, but they are not nearly as widely reflected as cardinal verbs. Many languages
also cut the main domains into smaller, more specific ones. For example, as well as _soaʔi_ ‘sit’
Manam has _basaʔi_ ‘sit cross-legged’ (Newman 2002:3). However, the data do not permit
reconstruction of such semantically narrow posture verbs.

    Two POc forms meaning ‘sit, stay, dwell’ are reconstructable: _*mono(ŋ)_/_*monoŋ-i_ and POc
_*nopo(q)_. A third form, _*mia[n]_, is reconstructed subject to certain caveats mentioned below.
Significantly, a purely postural meaning (‘sit’) is reconstructable for none of these verbs. In all
three instances, reflexes tend to mean ‘sit’, ‘stay’ or ‘dwell’ or a combination of these, whereas
reflexes of reconstructions meaning ‘stand’ (§6.2.2) and ‘lie’ (§6.2.3) tend to have glosses with
only a postural sense. There is a reason for this. In traditional Oceanic societies there were no
chairs or custom-made seats. People sat or squatted on the ground, so any ‘sit’ verb would not
have had the postural sense of English sit but would have meant ‘be located’ and have been a
candidate for service as the default POc locative verb.[4]

    Reflexes of the widely reflected POc _*toka_ ‘come to rest, settle (of vessel, on reef)’ also fall
into the ‘sit, stay, dwell’ domain, but its POc meaning seems to have been narrower and
indeed inchoative, a matter discussed below.

   POc _*nopo(q)_ ‘sit, stay, dwell’ is reconstructed with possible final _*-q_ on the basis of
Polynesian reflexes, as Polynesian languages preserve root-final consonants in transitive verbs
more faithfully than SE Solomonic languages like Lau below. Wayan Fijian shows two
apparent reflexes of _*nopo(q)_. Wayan _novo_ is the regular reflex, whereas _nō_ is irregular, as is
Bauan _no_. The items listed under ‘cf. also’ may be cognate, but they display irregularities.

   If Drehet (Adm) _-miŋ_ ‘sit’ and/or Ponapean (Mic) _mi_ ‘exist, be (at)’ reflect _*mia[n]_, as they
appear to, then POc _*mia[n]_ ‘sit, stay, live’ can also be reconstructed. If not, then the form is
of PWOc antiquity. Final _-ŋ_ of Drehet _-miŋ_ appears to reflect an added morpheme, as
Admiralties languages lose POc final consonants. Evidence as to whether _*mia[n]_ has a final
_*-n_ is ambiguous, and Bali reflects it both without (_mia_ ‘dwell’) and with _*-n_ (_miaŋa_, a
regular reflex).

   The primary sense of POc _*toka_ was apparently one of settling in a position following
movement, giving rise to glosses like ‘settle down’, ‘hit the bottom (of particles in suspension
in a liquid and of canoes’ and ‘land (after flying)’. In many languages its reflex denotes the
result of settling, ranging from ‘stuck on the reef’ (Roro [PT]) and ‘be aground’ (Tongan [Pn])
to the more general ‘sit’, ‘stay’ or ‘dwell’. In Poeng, Gela, Sa’a and PCP reflexes occur,
sometimes with a qualifier, with the meaning ‘sit on one’s haunches, squat’, and this seems to
have been a subsidiary meaning, overlapping with the domain of POc _*tike_ (§6.2.4.1).

   A number of reflexes point to a possible alternant _*toko_, and a few to a short alternant _*tok_.
Thus Nehan toko reflects _*tok_ with a regular echo vowel; the expected reflex of POc _*toka_ is
†toa.

6.2.2 Stand

Two POc verbs for ‘stand’ are reconstructable: _*tuqur_ ‘stand’ and _*madriRi_ ‘be standing
upright’. Both have PMP antecedents. Apparently no language in the data reflects both terms,
with a reflex of _*tuqur_ sometimes occurring in one language and a reflex of _*madriRi_ in a quite
closely related language. The competition between them seems to have been won in EOc
languages by _*tuqur_, as there are no EOc reflexes of _*madriRi_.

374 Malcolm Ross


    PNCV appears to have had two reflexes of POc _*tuqur_, namely _*tuqu_ and _*tuquru_
(Clark (2009) reconstructs _*tuqu-ru_). PNCV _*tuʔu_ is the expected reflex. PNCV _*tuquru_ reflects the
POc form plus an echo vowel, a minority pattern that occurs from time to time in PNCV.

    The Choiseul forms shown under ‘cf. also’ have expected consonant reflexes but the
‘wrong’ vowels. It is tempting to attribute them to an ‘Old Oceanic’ substrate (Ross 2010:263).

    The set below appears to reflect something like POc _*tutu_. It is not clear whether this is an
idiosyncratic alternant of _*tuqur_ or not. What is obvious is that the first _*-u-_ has a variety of
reflexes, suggesting that its POc stress fell on the second syllable, leading to reduction or loss
of the first _*-u-_.

   The set below is restricted to WOc languages but is clearly inherited from PAn. However, a
PMP form with _*ma-_, i.e. _*ma-diRi_, has not been reconstructed, and would in any case have
resulted in POc †_*ma-riri_. Instead the presence of _*-dr-_ in POc _*madriRi_ suggests earlier
†_*ma-n-diRi_. CMP languages with a nasal prefix occur (the ACD lists Fordata _n-diri_ and Kei
_en-dir_), but not enough is known about pre-Oceanic diachronic morphology to allow a firm
pre-Oceanic reconstruction.[5]

   The NNG and PT forms listed below may also reflect POc _*madriRi_. They allow the
reconstruction of putative PNGOc _*midi_ ‘stand’. If the latter reflects POc _*madriRi_, then two
idiosyncratic changes must be inferred: (a) _*ma-_ became _*mi-_ by assimilation to the _*-i-_ of
_*-driRi_; (b) loss of the final syllable _*-Ri_. Change (a) is also reflected in Dawawa
_-(wai)midiri_ ‘stand s.t. up’ and Misima _mílil_ above, and change (b) in Kilenge _-mari_, Tami
_moji_, Sio _-madi_ and Vitu _madi_. It is thus not unexpected that the two changes have sometimes
occurred simultaneously, and the terms listed below may well reflect independent parallel
innovations rather than a single PNGOc innovation.

6.2.3 Lie

One POc term, _*qenop_, is reconstructed for ‘lie, rest horizontally’. A good many reflexes also
mean ‘sleep’, but this is a natural development from ‘lie’. Distinct terms for ‘sleep’ are
reconstructed in §4.6.1.

    Blust (ACD) reconstructs the PAn term _*qinep_, of which the expected POc reflex is
†_*qinop_. He also reconstructs the doublet PEMP _*qenəp_,[6] reflected as POc _*qenop_. He
apparently infers that both forms were inherited into POc because a few terms in _-i-_ occur in
NNG languages, listed below under ‘cf. also’. One might alternatively infer, however, that
these reflect a NNG height assimilation. Also listed under ‘cf. also’ is the form inep, reflected
in three South New Ireland languages. The presence of _-e-_ for †_-o-_ in the second syllable is
unexplained.

    The distribution of reflexes of _*qenop_ shows some curious restrictions. Regular reflexes
occur nowhere in MM, in apparently only a few northern NCV languages, and not at all in
Micronesian or Central Pacific languages. In each of these areas other terms, some of them
words for ‘sleep’, have replaced _*qenop_, but it is not clear why this replacement is so
widespread. The only fairly widespread replacement is PCP _*koto_/PPn _*ta-koto_ below. PPn
_ta-_ appears to reflect POc _*ta-_, which marks the event denoted by the verb as spontaneous.
However, it is difficult to conceive of lying down as spontaneous.

6.2.4 Non-cardinal posture verbs

6.2.4.1   Squat, sit on haunches

Sitting on one’s haunches is still a posture frequently assumed in traditional villages in
Northwest Melanesia, so the reconstruction of POc _*tike_ ‘squat, sit on haunches’ is no surprise.
More of a surprise is that its reflexes are few, perhaps because its meaning is not collected by
linguists who use a standard word list, but their distribution points clearly to its presence in
POc.

6.2.4.2 Kneel

No POc term for ‘kneel’ has been reconstructed, but a small cognate set points to PWOc
_*tudruŋ_ ‘kneel’. This is evidently related to POc _*turu-_ ‘knee, joint’ (§3.6.5.2). As dr is the
prenasalised equivalent of _*r_, it is possible that _*tudruŋ_ reflects infixation of PMP _*<um>_, which
formed intransitive verbs, i.e. _*tudruŋ_ reflects earlier _*t<um>uruŋ_ (§1.3.5.5). Final _*-ŋ_ is
unaccounted for.

Nakanai in the west and Fijian and Polynesian in the east have compounds with two
components, the first a verb meaning ‘stand (a pole or spear) up straight’ or a noun meaning
‘supporting pole, stake’ and the second the term for ‘knee’. They form a collocation which
perhaps occurred in POc and which one might translate into English as ‘to knee-stand’. The
data below do not allow a POc reconstruction, but the Polynesian terms point to a possible PPn
_*toko-turi_ (_*toko_ (V) ‘support, prop up’, (N) ‘supporting pole, stake’; _*turi_ ‘knee’).

6.2.4.3 Hang

Of the postures, ‘hang’ has proven the most difficult to reconstruct forms for, but the reason for
this is clear. Oceanic languages have a variety of intransitive verbs of hanging (some of which
seem to be used transitively without derivation), but they differ from each other semantically,
and the same was presumably true of POc. Often dictionaries, let alone wordlists, do not
provide distinctive glosses for ‘hang’ words. The following three lists are illustrative.

 _teteru_    |  ‘hang down, droop (of laden branches, fringe of a mat, hair)’
 _tiro_      |  ‘hang down, droop (a dress, line, banana leaves)’

   There is evidence to allow a more specific gloss for POc _*tuku_ below, ‘(person) hang by
the arms, dangle’, but data on which POc _*sorop_ ‘hang’ and POc _*kuRu_ (VI) ‘hang’ are based
do not allow a more specific gloss. In the _*kuRu_ set the To’aba’ita gloss indicates the kind of
hanging the verb denotes, but a single gloss is an insufficient basis for a POc gloss.

6.2.4.4 Lean, slant

POc _*pʷaralat_ ‘be leaning, slanting’ is a posture verb, but the glosses suggest that its typical use
was with inanimate rather than human subjects. The medial consonant correspondences are
irregular, and the most natural inference is that Seimat reflects _*-r-_ and _*-l-_ regularly (as do the
Polynesian reflexes), whilst the remaining languages reflect assimilations. The Malaita-Makira
form _hatara_ is probably cognate, but its history is less clear.

6.3      Manner of movement verbs

There is a copious literature on movement verbs and movement constructions in the world’s
languages, much of it stemming from the work of Leonard Talmy (1972, 1974, 1985, 1991, 2000).
Talmy observed that languages tend to have either movement constructions in which
the main verb encodes the manner of motion, as in English as in _He ran into the cave_, or
movement constructions in which it encodes the path of motion, as in Spanish
_Entró corriendo a la cueva_ [entered.3SG running to the cave]. Path is encoded in the English
example by the preposition _into_, and manner in the Spanish example by the participle
_corriendo_ ‘running’.[7]

   These English and Spanish movement constructions each have just one finite verb.
Talmy’s classification also allows for serial verb constructions like those which occur in
Oceanic languages, discussed in Ross (2004a) and briefly in vol.2 (pp257–258), and
illustrated in this Hoava (MM) example:[8]

[7] More recent work (Aske 1989, Huang & Tanangkingsing 2005, Croft et al. 2010) emphasises that many
    languages have constructions of both types, depending on the semantics of the event.

                                                                            Posture and movement 385

MANNER       PATH        DEIXIS
‘The possum came running out.’ (Davis 2003:155)

In this construction, the elements of manner, path and deixis are each encoded by a finite verb,
respectively of locomotion, geographic direction (vol.2:259–267) and deictic direction
(vol.2:269–282). This ordering also occurs in other language families, e.g. in Thai
(Thepkanjana 1986:136). Omission of any one of the three elements is quite common, as here
in Hoava.

MANNER        PATH
‘The child climbed up the coconut tree.’ (Davis 2003:155)

Elaboration of this manner–path–deixis schema, often by the presence of more than one path
verb, is quite common across Oceanic languages, as in this Tuam (NNG) sentence:[9]

Waax          tsiei        i-looɣ     i-pot      i-zi         nuɣ              tawe.

‘Our canoe/boat went coastwards and floated to that place there.’ (Bugenhagen 2007)

    Talmy’s original classification of movement constructions and verbs did not include a
deictic element, but Talmy (2008) treats deixis as a subpart of path. Path and deixis are
typically encoded separately in Oceanic languages, but in some of them verbs of deixis have
been grammaticised as a separate morpheme class (Ross 2004a).

    The remainder of this section is concerned with verbs of locomotion, i.e. verbs that occur
in the manner slot of a movement construction. Verbs of geographic and deictic direction,
filling the path and deixis slots, are reconstructed in vol.2 (pp259–272).

    Verbs of locomotion can be conveniently divided according to the medium on/in which
movement takes place: on land (§6.3.1), in the air (§3.2) or in water (§3.3).

6.3.1 Locomotion on land

Verbs of land-based locomotion include meanings like ‘go’, ‘walk’, ‘run’, ‘crawl’, ‘creep’,
‘limp’, ‘hop’ and ‘roll’.

6.3.1.1 Go, move

The broadest of these meanings is ‘go’, which in some Oceanic languages also denotes sea-
based locomotion. Traditional travel on land was always on foot, and so the ‘go’ verb often also
means ‘go on foot, walk’. The verbs of deictic direction away from the speaker or towards a
location other than the speaker, described in vol.2 (pp273-282), all seem to have been
polysemous insofar as they also served as verbs of locomotion with the basic meaning ‘go’.
These verbs were:

[8] There has been debate (Slobin 2004, Zlatev & Yangklang 2004, Talmy 2008, Ameka & Essegbey 2013)
    as to whether a serial verb construction contains a main verb. One criterion offered by Talmy is that the
    verb belonging to the set with the largest number of members is the main verb. In Oceanic languages this
    would be the manner verb if there is one, otherwise the path verb.

[9] Most descriptions are silent as to how such constructions should be analysed.

These are presented and their locomotion uses discussed below. The verbs _*lako_ (vol.2:258,

Manam (NNG), Mota (NCV), Woleaian (Mic), Puluwatese (Mic)—have verbal
reflexes of a long and a short form side by side.

    Where a form reflecting _*lako_ or _*laka_ (§6.3.1.3 below) has lost its final vowel, it can be
difficult to know which verb it reflects. Tuam _-laɣ_ and Kaiep _-lak_ are assumed to be cognate
with Gitua _-laɣo_ and Manam/Wogeo _-lako_ respectively, and Sursurunga _lək-lək_ is taken to
reflect _*lako_ because the root _lək(ə)_ occurs in the compound _ləkə(m)_ ‘come’, reflecting _*lako_
+ _*mai_, a combination occurring in other MM languages.

   The long vowel in ’Are’are and Oroha _rā_ below probably reflects a preference for bimoraic
roots.[10] However, Andrew Pawley (pers. comm.) suggests that perhaps all forms reflecting _ *la_
are bimoraic, but that length is not represented in their orthographies. If this is so, then the POc
form should also be reconstructed as bimoraic, i.e. _*lā_.

   The forms listed below under ‘cf. also’ appear to reflect a POc form _*lae_, but it is not clear
how this might have differed from _*la_. It is possible that these forms represent independent
developments (perhaps associated with bimoraicity preference), the more so as the sequence
_*-ae_ is not otherwise found in reconstructed POc.

   In the short-form set below Loniu (Adm) _-lɛ_, Titan (Adm) _-le_, both ‘go to’, and Lonwolwol
(NCV) _-le_ ‘leave (a place)’, reflect coalescence either of _*la_ + transitive suffix _*-i_ or possibly
of _*la_ + locative preposition*i.

[10] The expected reflex of _*laka_ (§6.3.1.3) in both languages is †_laʔa_.

   There was evidently a difference in usage between POc _*lako_ ‘go (to)’ and POc _*pano_
‘go (away)’. As noted in vol.2 (p279), many verbal reflexes of _*lako_ have a valency which
implies or requires a destination (expressed, for example, as a prepositional phrase), whilst
those of _*pano_ are intransitive.

   A few reflexes of POc _*pano_ indicate that it was also a geographic directional verb
meaning ‘move in a transverse direction’, contrasting with ‘go up, go inland’ and ‘go down,
go seawards’. This is discussed in vol.2 (p279).

    A small number of forms from Schouten (NNG) and Reefs/Santa Cruz (TM) languages
and one from Sobei (SJ) are listed below. It would be easy to attribute them to POc _*pa_
above, but in all instances except Medebur initial _w-_ reflects _*w-_ or _*u-_. They evidently
reflect the POc deictic directional verb _*ua_ ‘go towards addressee’ (vol.2:273–274). There is
no other evidence to suggest that POc _*ua_ functioned as a locomotion verb, and its extended
use as a verb of locomotion may have developed separately on the north coast of New
Guinea and in the Reefs/Santa Cruz languages.

    The medial consonant of POc _*[y]aku_ ‘go, go away’ is reconstructed on the basis of Yabem
low tone, which reflects the loss of a Proto Huon Gulf voiced obstruent, probably either _*v_ or _*ɣ_,
lenis reflexes of POc _*p_ or _*k_. Of these, both are lost intervocalically in Takia, but only _*k_ is lost
in the Admiralties languages.

    Only a few reflexes of POc _*oRo_ ‘come, go’ have been found outside Polynesia. The

   Just as it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between reflexes of _*lako_ (above) and _*laka_
(§6.3.1.3), so it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between reflexes of _*pano_ (above) and
_*pana_ (below). Languages as far apart phylogenetically as Vitu and Māori have reflexes of
both forms, indicating that both occurred in POc, but there are few languages reflecting both
and it is difficult to be sure what the POc meaning contrast was.

    Blust (ACD) notes that, ‘In many languages reflexes of this form [_*pana_] are indistinguishable
from reflexes of the far more common PAn _*paNaw_, POc _*pano_ ‘go away, depart, leave
on a journey’. Label han is assumed to reflect POc _*pana_ rather than *pano since its closest
relatives which have preserved the final vowel point to _*-a_.’ The same assumption is made
here regarding other New Ireland reflexes, except for those with reduplicated versions that
mean ‘walk’. These are attributed to _*pano_ (see POc (?) _*pa(no)_-pano ‘walk’ in §6.3.1.3), but
this decision may be mistaken.

6.3.1.3 Walk, step, stride

It is difficult to distinguish between the meanings of _*lako_/_*la_ and _*pano_/_*pa_ ‘go on
foot’ (§6.3.1.1) and of the terms in the present section, but the terms below each perhaps denote
the specific action of walking as opposed to generic going on foot.

    Two POc terms meaning ‘go, walk’, _*raka(t)_ and _*laka_, are formally similar to POc _*lako_
‘go (away, to), walk’ above. Where the nucleus of the second syllable reflects _*-o_ or _*-a_, the
distinction between _*lako_ and _*raka(t)_/_*laka_ is straightforward. The attribution to _*lako_ of
reflexes that have lost the final vowel is briefly explained in §6.3.1.1. Where a verb reflects the
short form _*la_, it is taken to reflect _*lako_.

    It is more difficult, however, to distinguish between reflexes of POc _*raka(t)_ ‘go, walk’ and
of POc _*laka_ ‘go, walk’ in languages that have merged POc _*r_ and _*l_, but terms that have the
sense of stepping over something are attributed to _*laka_. This motivates the attribution of PPn
_*laka_ ‘step, march; pass, cross over’ and its many reflexes to _*laka_ rather than to _*raka(t)_,
although phonologically they could reflect either. It seems likely that reflexes of the two terms
were conflated in some languages. The PMP ancestors of POc _*raka(t)_ and _*laka_ are
respectively _*rakat_ and _*la(ŋ)kaq_, but transitive Wayan (Fij) _lakat-i_ reflects _*l-_ (not _*r-_) but
_*-t_ (not _*-q_), pointing to a hybrid _*lakat_.

    Lihir merges _*r_ and _*l_ as _l_, but on semantic grounds Lihir _laka(n)_, listed under ‘cf. also’,
probably reflects _*raka(t)_ rather than _*laka_. Other items listed under _*raka(t)_ have an
unambiguous initial consonant.

_raka-roho_ ‘stride along’, _raka-kahira_ ‘draw near’, and _raka-kava_ ‘walk aimlessly’. Its Sinaugoro
cognate behaves similarly: _raka-rosi_ ‘go outside’, _raka-vesiri_ ‘go away’,
_raka-ɣeɣeraɣi-ɣeɣeraɣi_ ‘go from place to place’.

   A reduplicated reflex of POc _*pano_ ‘go (away)’, (?) ‘move in a transverse direction’ (§6.3.1.1)
means ‘walk’ in a number of languages with a discontinuous distribution including some MM
languages of New Ireland, some SES languages, and a number of northern Vanuatu languages.
The reduplicated form is tentatively attributed to POc.

[11] John Lynch points out that Clark (2004) reconstructs PNCV _*lakau~*lakawa_ ‘cross over’. I suggest this may
     be a lexicalised serial verb construction made up of _*laka_ and POc _*ua_ ‘go towards addressee’ (vol.2:284).

   At first sight POc _*pajale_ ‘walk about, take a walk’ looks suspiciously like the root _*jalan_
‘path’, preceded by the causative prefix _*pa-_. However, this would give rise to Lavongai

6.3.1.4 Move quickly, hurry, run

Terms in this area of meaning are difficult to reconstruct, as lexical replacement seems to have
been frequent. For this probable reason reflexes of the reconstructed etyma have spotty
distributions.


396 Malcolm Ross


   POc _*(i,a)ropu_ ‘run’ bears a superficial resemblance to POc _*Ropok_ ‘fly’ (§6.3.2.1), and
indeed some terms meaning ‘run’ reflect the latter (e.g. Longgu [SES] _lovo-lovo_ ‘run quickly’,
a reduplicated form of lovo ‘fly’). The terms listed below, however, reflect POc _*r-_, as reflexes
of _*r_ and _*R_ are distinct in Admiralties languages. Furthermore, terms for ‘fly’ reflecting
_*Ropok_—Mussau _loo_, Titan _yo_, Misima _you_—are different from those reflecting _*(i,a)ropu_
‘run’.

>

    The cognate set supporting POc _*joŋas_ ‘move quickly’ entails two small phonological
difficulties. First, the non-Micronesian reflexes reflect POc _*j-_, but Bender et al. (2003)
reconstruct PMic _*caŋa_. PMic _*c-_ regularly reflects POc _*d_ or _*dr_. However, Kiribati _r-_
reflects POc _*d_, _*dr_ or _*j-_, and the most economic assumption is that Ponapean _t-_ and
Chuukese _c̣-_ reflect an irregular intra-Micronesian sound change. Second, evidence as to the
first vowel is conflicting. Admiralties and NNG languages reflect _-o-_, MM and Micronesian
languages _-a-_. I have assumed here that the protovowel was _*-o-_ and that _-a-_ is the result of
assimilation.

6.3.1.6 Limp, hop

The senses of reflexes of POc _*tige_ vary between ‘hop on one leg’, ‘limp’ and ‘walk on tiptoe’.
Iduna _sike_ and Longgu _tike_ occur where respectively †_ɣige_ and †_ige_ would be the regular
reflexes and are evidently loans. PPn *_teki_ reflects vowel metathesis.

6.3.1.7 Roll

This subsection concerns ‘roll’ as an intransitive locomotion verb expressing the manner in
which its subject moves, e.g. ‘The stone rolled down the hill.’ At first sight, the items in the
three sets below seem to form a single cognate set, but closer examination shows that they
reflect three different POc etyma. The first, _*buliŋ_ (VI) ‘roll’, was intransitive (or just possibly
ambitransitive, i.e. used both transitively and intransitively). The other two, *(p,pʷ)uluk-i- (VT)
‘roll’ and *(p,pʷ)uri- (VT) ‘roll’, were transitive, and intransitive forms meaning ‘roll’ in its
locomotion sense were formed with the spontaneity prefix _*ta-_ (§1.3.5.4). Drehet _ta-pulu-i_ and
Samoan _ta-fuli_ (VI) reflect POc _*ta-_, while Bariai _ma-pul_ reflects POc _*ma-_. These prefixes are
described by Evans (2003:268–271, 279–284), who notes that both were only semi-productive
in POc, both were valency-decreasing, removing the agent, while _*ta-_ also emphasised the
spontaneity of the event (2003:300).

6.3.1.8 Climb

‘Climb’ has two main senses in English: ‘go up’ and ‘propel oneself up or down (a tree, a cliff
etc)’. The first of these senses is a verb of direction, and its POc equivalent is _*sake_,
reconstructed in vol.2 (pp 263-264). The sense intended here is the second, although the glosses
below suggest that its meaning was readily extended to include the first sense. The POc verb is
*panaik, and one of the activities it denoted was one that is still readily seen in Melanesian
villages, nicely defined in Ivens’ (1918) dictionary definition: ‘climb trees … with a rope round
the feet, ascending by alternate jumps of hands and feet’.

    Blust (ACD) reconstructs _*panek_, as supported by his data. POc _*panaik_ is reconstructed
here to take account of Lukep _painak_, which appears to reflect metathesis of the two syllable
nuclei.

6.3.2 Locomotion in the air

There are far fewer terms for locomotion in the air than for on land or in/on water simply
because human beings in traditional societies do not engage in aerial locomotion. The two main
meanings associated with movement through the air are ‘fly’ and ‘fall’.

6.3.2.1 Fly

The most widespread cognate set for ‘fly’ reflects POc _*Ropok_. It is not found, however, in
Micronesian or in this meaning in Central Pacific languages. Reflexes exist in Polynesian but
with changed meaning (PPn _*ofo_ ‘be startled, wake up’; §4.6.4) In Micronesian languages
_*Ropok_ is replaced by various terms. In Eastern Fijian we find Bauan _vuka_, Boumaa _vuʔa_, in
Western Fijian Wayan _ðavu_, whilst the PPn term was _*lele_ (see below). The Fijian terms listed
under ‘cf. also’ look at first sight like reflexes of _*Ropok_, but are not, as the expected reflex is
†_ovo_.

   It is interesting that some reflexes of POc _*Ropok_ and PPn _*rere_ taken from sources that
provide more detailed definitions are glossed not only as ‘fly’ but also as ‘jump’, implying
perhaps that the core meaning of the POc and PPn terms was something like ‘move through
the air without touching the ground’.

6.3.2.2 Fall (from a height)

The English term ‘fall’ is polysemous, and only the locomotion sense ‘fall from a height’ is
considered here. As Zlatev & Yangklang (2004) point out in relation to serial verb
constructions in Thai, ‘fall’ is not strictly a verb of locomotion, but rather a path verb, i.e. a
verb of geographic direction. What is more, unlike most locomotion verbs it is not agentive.
These facts perhaps provide a clue as to why no Oceanic-wide cognate set for ‘fall’ is found:
a number of languages instead use their geographic direction verb ‘go down’ for ‘fall’, thus
treating ‘go down’ as unmarked for agentivity.

    The most widely reflected form in the data is POc _*(p,pʷ)u(k,kʷ)a_ ‘fall’. Under ‘cf. also’ are
listed a number of WOc items that reflect the appropriate consonants but lack the ‘right’
vowels. This is a conundrum that awaits explanation.

6.3.3 Locomotion in and on water

In a study of verbs used in various languages for locomotion in and on water Lander,
Maisak & Rahilina (2012) divide this semantic domain into three semantic subdomains: (a) swimming
(self-propelled motion of an animate being); (b) floating (uncontrolled and non-agentive
motion); and (c) sailing (motion of vessels and of the people aboard). Some languages (e.g.
English) have verbs for each of these domains and little more. Others elaborate the
subdomains. For example, Indonesian elaborates (c) with many verbs formed from nouns
denoting vessels or areas of water. Others, on the other hand, conflate the three subdomains,
like Russian, where _plyt’_/_plavat’_ is a verb denoting locomotion in and on water in general.

   Given that the speakers of POc were skilful sailors, in many cases long-distance sailors,
one might expect POc to have been like Indonesian. Indeed, perhaps it was, but the available
data do not allow reconstruction of an elaborate set of terms for (c). Only POc _*palau(r)_ ‘go
to sea, make a sea voyage’ is reconstructable (§6.3.3.1). This may be because relevant terms
in modern languages have been lost with the demise of the ocean-going canoe, or simply
because researchers have not been conscious of the need to collect such terms. POc terms can
be reconstructed for the three subdomains proposed by Lander et al., but not for much more.
There was also a verb for ‘wade’ (§6.3.3.2), a concept not included in their analysis. There are
two reconstructions for ‘swim’ (§6.3.3.3) and one for ‘go under water’ (§6.3.3.4). The ‘swim’
terms presumably differed in meaning in some now irretrievable way. Modern languages
often distinguish between swimming on the surface and swimming under the surface. There
were also terms for ‘float’ (§6.3.3.5). Thus if one is to believe the testimony of the
reconstructions presented in this section, POc was like English in its lexicalisation of
locomotion in and on water, but this may well be an artefact of data collection and/or
modernisation.

6.3.3.1 Travel by sea

No term for a locomotion verb ‘sail’ is reconstructable. POc _*palau(r)_ meant ‘go to sea, make a
sea voyage’, and is derived from PMP _*lahud_/POc _*laur_ ‘sea, seawards’ (vol.2:91–92).

6.3.3.2 Wade

POc had a term for wading, i.e. for walking through water deep enough to impede free
movement, namely _*tuRu(p)_. Blust (ACD) is uncertain whether the medial consonant is _*R_, but
this is confirmed by the Baluan reflex. He suggests on the basis of SES transitive reflexes that
the POc form may have ended in _*-p_. The latter is parenthesised here as we so far have
evidence of it only in SES languages.

6.3.3.3 Swim

Four POc terms possibly meaning ‘swim’ are reconstructable, namely _*kaRu_ and _*qasa_, both
‘swim’, _*loso_ ‘bathe, swim’ and _*kʷaya_ ‘immerse self, swim’. It is reasonable to infer that their
meanings differed, but, because there is a tendency for reflexes to shift meaning, the
protoglosses are inevitably tentative. A major distinction that was evidently made is that
between swimming as a physical activity entailing movement of arms and legs, and immersing
oneself in water, typically with the intention of washing one’s body. The first two verbs, _*kaRu_
and _*qasa_ appear to have denoted the physical activity of swimming by moving arms and legs,
whereas _*loso_ and _*kʷaya_ apparently denoted immersion. Hence _*kaRu_ and _*qasa_ were
locomotion verbs, and their cognate sets are listed below. POc _*loso_ and _*kʷaya_, on the other
hand, denoted a physical activity other than locomotion and appear in chapter 7.

6.3.3.4 Dive, go under water

Although most Oceanic languages have verbs that denote various kinds of diving as a human
physical activity, the data do not allow POc reconstructions to be made for these meanings. The
directional aspect of diving is often indicated by one of the geographic verbs for ‘go down’,
POc _*sipo_ and _*sobu_, reconstructed in vol.2:261-262. Nonetheless, one of the meanings of
POc _*ruku_ was ‘go under water’.

6.3.3.5 Float, drift

Two POc terms meaning ‘float, drift’ can be reconstructed, but it is debatable whether either of
them was a locomotion verb. POc _*ma-qañur_ ‘floating, adrift’ is a promising candidate, as its
Seimat and Arosi reflexes have glosses that imply movement. POc _*saliR_ ‘flow, of water’
denoted movement of water, but the glosses of some of its reflexes also denote the movement
of an object floating on flowing water. Whether the latter sense is reconstructable to POc is
unclear. NCV reflexes do mean ‘float’, but the unexpected final vowel of PNCV _*sale_ calls
into question its descent from POc _*saliR_. PWOc _*pʷati_ ‘float, drift, be carried on water’ does
seem to have denoted movement, but no EOc reflexes have been found.

6.4     Direction verbs

A section with this title also occurs in vol.2 (pp 256-282). It presents reconstructions of the
semantically most basic verbs of geographic direction, i.e. _*sipo_, _*sobu_ and _*[s,j]u[(a,u)]_ ‘go
downward’, _*sake_ ‘go upward’, _*surup_ ‘enter, penetrate’, and of deictic direction, i.e. _*ma[i]_
‘come (towards speaker)’, _*ua_/_*watu_ ‘towards addressee, _*la[ko]_, _*pa[no]_ and _*[y]aku_ ‘away
from speaker’. The purpose of the present section is to offer reconstructions of verbs that are
semantically more complex but have a directional semantic component.

6.4.1 Return

Verbs of returning arguably encode both an element of geographic direction, in that there is a
reversal of path direction, and an element of deixis, as movement is towards a goal identical
with an earlier starting point of movement.

   Three verbs of returning reflect a single PMP root _*uliq_. Final _*-iq_ is often raised to
Oceanic _-e_. POc evidently had reflexes of both the plain root _*uliq_ (POc _*uli(q)_, _*ule_) and of
_*um-uliq_ (POc _*mule_), where PMP _*um-_ is the marker of actor voice, present by default as the
PMP verb was intransitive.

    Blust (1983b:11–13) draws attention to an idiosyncratic innovation shared by CMP and
Oceanic languages. This is the raising of PMP _*u-_ to _*o-_ giving a PCEMP variant _*oliq_
‘return’, reflected in Oceanic only in SES languages.

6.4.2 Turn round


412 Malcolm Ross

POc apparently had two homophonous verbs with the root _*liu_, one glossed ‘turn aside, change
direction’ (this section) and the other _*liu_ ‘go beyond, pass, surpass’ (§6.4.3). It is possible that
both reflect PAn _*liuS_, which Blust (ACD) glosses ‘circumambulate, circumvent’. However, its
Formosan reflexes suggest that PAn _*liuS_ formed both intransitive and transitive verbs
meaning ‘turn around’,[12] the sense inherited by POc. Whether PAn _*liuS_ was also ancestral to
PMP _*liu_ ‘surpass, exceed’ is not clear.

    In addition to POc _*liu_ ‘turn aside, change direction’, a reduplicated _*li-liu_ ‘turn around, go
back’ is also reconstructable (the different glosses of POc _*liu_ and _*li-liu_ are tentative at best).
Many reflexes of these two forms are similar in meaning to reflexes of the items in §6.4.1, but
the overall pattern of their glosses suggests that _*liu_ and _*li-liu_ profiled the semantic element
of turning around rather than simply of going back.

    The forms listed under ‘cf. also’ below appear to reflect a POc _*[ri]riu_ ‘turn’, i.e. a form in
which _*l_ had been replaced by _*r_. This is not a regular sound change.

414 Malcolm Ross


    Three further POc terms meaning ‘turn round’ or ‘turn back’ are reconstructable. The first,
_*likot_, is reconstructed on the basis of evidence from western Malayo-Polynesian languages
noted in the ACD and a single regular Oceanic reflex, Bali (MM) _liɣota_. The Vangunu reflex
_likoso_ is irregular, as the expected form is †_liɣoto_.

   The other two reconstructions are formally similar, and it is hard to believe that they are not
historically connected in some way, as both display the pattern *LABIAL_-ulos_. They are:

__block__
• POc _*[ta]bulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round, turn back’, _*bulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn round, turn back’
• POc _*pulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round’, _*pulos-i-_ (VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’

However, there is no straightforward way to unify them.

    The first, _*[ta]bulo(s)_, _*bulos-i-_, is internally consistent. Most of the intransitive forms
reflect the semi-productive POc prefix _*ta-_, which decreased valency by removing the agent,
and emphasised the spontaneity of the event (§1.3.5.4; Evans 2003:300). However, in this
instance, the prefix simply functions to reduce valency.

     a lenis reflex is expected, is probably explained by the fact that the sequence _*pu-_
     sometimes gives rise to [*pʷu], where [*pʷ] resists lenition.
-    The sequence [*pʷu] sometimes becomes [*pʷi] in Oceanic languages, i.e. the rounding
     feature is fully transferred from [*u] to preceding [*pʷ], accounting for _-i-_, instead of †_-u-_,
     in W Guadalcanal, Talise, Birao and all NCV reflexes except Kiai.
-    The second vowel, _*-o-_, is fronted to _-e-_ (or _-i-_ in Tabar and Neve’ei) in both intransitive
     and transitive forms. This is especially common in NCV reflexes, leading Clark (2009) to
     reconstruct two PNCV forms, _*viles-i_ and _*vilos-i_. There is no obvious explanation for
     this alternation, but it is very unlikely that †_*pules-i-_ occurred in POc, as _*e_ is usually
     stem-final, reflecting PMP _*-ay_.

These considerations point to the reconstruction of POc _*pulo(s)_ (VI) ‘turn round’, _*pulos-i-_
(VT) ‘turn (s.t.) round’, and also suggest that early Vanuatu Oceanic must also have retained the
form _*vulos-i_.

   The POc stems _*bulos_ and _*pulos_ which are central to the reconstructions above must have
a common origin, but they are not related by any known morphological pattern.

6.4.3 Go beyond, pass by, surpass

The formal identity of POc _*liu_ ‘go beyond, pass, surpass’ and POc _*liu_ ‘turn aside, change
direction’ is discussed in the introduction to 6.4.2 above.

  Grammaticisation of a verb meaning ‘surpass’—often a figurative extension of a verb
meaning ‘go beyond, pass’—as a comparative marker is common in Oceanic languages, such
that _My house is bigger than yours_ is expressed by a clause containing a serial verb
construction with the sense ‘My house big surpasses yours.’ Such a use is noted in the
’Are’are and Arosi dictionary entries from which items below are drawn.

6.4.4 Arrive, appear

Four POc verbs are reconstructed in this section: _*potu_ ‘appear, come into view’, _*pʷosa_
‘appear’, _*pura_ ‘arrive, appear’, _*pʷaka_ ‘come into view’. They share similar clusters of
meanings: ‘arrive’, ‘come into view’, ‘rise (especially of the moon)’ and ‘appear’. They are
included here because reflexes of the most widely reflected of the four, _*potu_, serve as direction
verbs in serial verb constructions in at least the languages of southern New Ireland, as in this
Ramoaaina (MM) example.

__igt__
i=             wan          pat
3SG=           go           arrive
               MANNER       DEIXIS
‘He came.’ (Fritzell & Davies, Ramoaaina vocabulary)

    Clark (2009) notes that in north and central Vanuatu languages reflexes of _*potu_ are used
of the emergence of the new moon: e.g. Mota _o vula we wot ma_ ‘a new moon appears’, and
occur as an attribute in the phrase ‘new moon’: e.g. Nokuku _wul wotu_ ‘new moon’, Tamambo
_vitu-votu_ ‘new moon’, Rerep _nebur mi uet_ ‘new moon’.

    The presentation of POc _*pʷaka_ ‘come into view’ below retains Bender et al.’s (2003)
presentation of Micronesian data supporting PMic _*pʷax(a,e)_ but separates off under ‘cf. also’
the transitive reflexes they list meaning ‘show’ or ‘announce’. This is done to highlight a
difficulty in Bender et al.’s analysis. They reconstruct PMic medial _*-x-_ (< POc _*g_) on the
basis of the seemingly regular sound correspondence Kosraean _-k_, Ponapean, Mokilese and
Pingelapese _-r_ and Chuukese, Puluwatese, Carolinian and Woleaian zero (Bender et al. 2003:4).
This is achieved by segmenting the transitives as Chuukese _pʷǣ-ri_ etc. But if, as is
usual, the consonant preceding the transitive suffix _-i_ belongs to the PMic root (Chuukese
_pʷǣr-i_ etc.), then Chuukese, Puluwatese, Carolinian and Woleaian have _-r_ in this position, and
all items except Kosraean reflect PMic _*pʷar(a,e)_, not PMic _*pʷax(a,e)_. If this reinterpretation
is correct, then it is possible that all Micronesian items other than Kosraean reflect POc _*pura_
above, rather than POc _*pʷaka_.

6.5.2 Gather, congregate

A POc verb of the form _*so(k,g)o(n)_ is reconstructable with a meaning that has to do with
gathering or assembly, but both its form and its semantics are problematic. The Mussau, Mota
and Paamese reflexes point to medial _*-k-_, the Lonwolwol and Wayan reflexes to _*-g-_ (and
Nguna to _*-ŋ-_). The glosses make it difficult to determine which form is intransitive, which
transitive. On formal grounds, _*so(k,g)o(n)_ was presumably intransitive, _*so(k,g)on-i_ transitive,
but the Nguna and Wayan Fijian use of _*so(k,g)on-i_ as intransitive render this a little uncertain.

6.6        Caused movement verbs

Caused movement refers to an event where an agent, usually a person, causes a theme (the
person or thing that is moved) to move. The semantic frame of caused movement is rather
complex. It involves

__block__
• an agent (who/which moves the theme)
• a theme (what is moved)
• a source (the location the theme is moved from)
• a goal (the location the theme is moved to)
• the movement event itself

Thus in an English sentence like

__tablenh__
She      |   moved  | the pot  |      from the table | to the ground
AGENT    |   EVENT  |   THEME  |    SOURCE           | GOAL

all five frame elements are profiled.[15] Caused movement constructions differ as to whether
these elements are all profiled. In this construction the source and the goal are each optional.
In construction with, say, put (instead of moved), the goal is obligatory and for many
English-speakers the source is obligatorily absent.

    Crucially, however, the verb itself may also profile certain frame elements. Predictably
some caused movement verbs profile elements associated with posture and movement verbs,
discussed in earlier sections. These include:

__block__
 4. the resulting posture of the theme (cf §6.2): transitive sit/seat/set, stand, lay, hang
 5. locomotion (cf §6.3), i.e. the manner of movement of the theme: drop (‘let fall, cause to
     fall’), send (‘cause to go’), throw (‘cause to fly’), transitive roll
 6. the direction of vertical movement (§6.4): lift, raise (‘cause to go up’), lower, drop
   (‘cause to go down’)
 7. the path of movement (§6.4)): insert (‘cause to go into’), extract (‘cause to come out of’),
   immerse (‘cause to go into water’), box (‘cause to be in boxes’)
 8. Other frame elements profiled by caused movement verbs relate to human causal agency:
 9. whether or not the agent accompanies the theme in its movement:16
 10. not specified, with take, push and pull
    a. yes, with carrying verbs like carry, bring, drag
    b. if no, then whether or not some part or tool of the agent touches the theme until it
        reaches its goal
        i. yes, with putting verbs like put, insert, immerse
        ii. no, with sending verbs like send, drop, throw
        iii. the kind of force that the agent applies in order to move the theme: push, pull,
             drag, throw
 11. change of possession: give, present, distribute, receive, exchange, steal

[15] Semantic frames, frame elements and profiling are terms from Frame Semantics, a theory of meaning
     deriving from the work of Charles J. Fillmore (see especially Fillmore 1982, 1985).
     Croft & Cruse (2004:8–22 and passim.) provide an overview. A short set of definitions is given
     at https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/about .
                                                                               Posture and movement 423


   The elements listed above are not mutually exclusive. Some of the English verbs given as
examples occur more than once because their meaning potentially profiles more than one
element. Because of this, verbs can be somewhat arbitrarily categorised in various ways. The
organisation below is an attempt to categorise verbs by meaning in a way that is appropriate to
Oceanic languages. A primary three-way division is based on item 9 which distinguishes
among the following: a few verbs like take, push and pull where the agent may or may not
accompany the theme in its movement (9a); carrying verbs, quite numerous in Oceanic
languages (9b); and verbs of putting and sending (9c). Explanations of lower-order categories
are distributed through the sections below, which are arranged as follows:

__block__
 6.6.1. Simple caused movement:
     6.6.1.1. Taking (9a)
     6.6.1.2. Verbs that profile vertical direction: raising and lowering (3)
     6.6.1.3. Force-profiling verbs: pushing and pulling (9a, iii)
 6.6.2. Accompanied caused movement (9a):
     6.6.2.1–12. Carrying verbs that profile the physical relationship between agent and theme
     6.6.2.13. Dragging
 6.6.3. Unaccompanied caused movement:
     6.6.3.1. Putting (9c-i)
            6.6.3.1.1. Simple putting
            6.6.3.1.2. Putting verbs that profile the resulting posture of the theme (1)
            6.6.3.1.3. Putting verbs that profile the path of movement (4)
            6.6.3.1.4. ‘Putting’ in reverse: taking
     6.6.3.2. Sending (9c-ii)

   The verbs reconstructed in the sections below consist of a root or, in the case of transitives
formed from a root ending in _-a_ or a consonant, of root + _*-i_. POc evidently had two
morphological means of forming a caused movement verb from a locomotion (§6.3) or
direction verb (§6.4). One was to prefix it with the causative derivational prefix _*pa-_, a
process reflected in this Kwaio (SES) example:

   Kwaio _oli_ ‘return, come back to’ >      _faʔa-oli-_ ‘cause to return, send back’

[16] This distinction is adopted from Levin’s (1993) analysis of English verbs. Note, though, that by no means all
     distinctions that work for English verbs work for Oceanic verbs. English take and bring contrast in deixis
     (‘away from deictic centre’ vs ‘towards deictic centre’), but deixis is not usually profiled by caused
     movement verbs in Oceanic languages, as the discussion in §6.6.1.1 indicates.

424 Malcolm Ross


   The other was to add the applicative suffix _*-akin[i]_. Semantically this had two functions, as
Evans (2003:203) notes. In the first it produced a verb like those formed with _*pa-_, in which
the agent causes the theme to perform the action denoted by the root, as in

__tablenh__
   Manam          _gege_ (VI) ‘roll’    >    _gege-ak_ (VT) ‘roll’
                  _alale_ (VI) ‘walk’   >    _alale-ak_ (VT) ‘help s.o. walk’
   NE Ambae       _saga_ ‘go on top’    >    _sagat-agi[ni]_ ‘put s.t. on top’
   Bauan          _ðuru_ ‘enter’        >    _ðurum-aki_ ‘insert s.t.’
                  _dromu_ ‘sink’        >    _dromuð-aki_ ‘push s.t. under (water),

In the typology above, these are simple or unaccompanied caused movement verbs.

    In the second function _*-akin[i]_ formed a verb in which the agent performs the action
denoted by the root, and the theme is a concomitant:

__tablenh__
   NE Ambae       _toa_ ‘run’           >    _toa-gi[ni]_ ‘run off with s.t.’
                  _hivo_ ‘go down’      >    _hivo-gi[ni]_ ‘go down with s.t., take s.t. down’
                  _vano_ ‘go’           >    _vano-gi[ni]_ ‘go with s.t., take s.t.’
   Bauan          _ðiði_ ‘run’          >    _ðiðiv-aki_ ‘run off with s.t.’
                  _galo_ ‘swim’         >    _galov-aki_ ‘swim with s.t.’

Such verbs are verbs of accompanied caused movement, resembling verbs of carrying.
However, in a carrying verb it is the physical relationship between the agent and the theme that
is profiled. In an _*-akin[i]_ verb it is the manner or direction of the agent’s movement that is
profiled.

    Verbs formed with _*pa-_ and _*-akin[i]_ are not considered further here, because we cannot
be sure which derived verbs occurred in POc. But we can be sure that the morphosemantic
processes reflected in these examples occurred in POc. The functions of _*pa-_ have been
widely discussed in the literature, and Evans (2003:195, 203) shows that the two functions of
_*-akin[i]_ mentioned here are reflected so widely that they must be reconstructed for POc.

6.6.1 Simple caused movement

The word ‘simple’ is used here of verbs that are unspecified for a certain frame element. Verbs
of taking (§6.6.1.1) and the force-profiling verbs of pushing and pulling (§6.1.2) are
unspecified for item 9 in the list above. That is, they sometimes denote accompanied caused
movement, sometimes unaccompanied. In the case of verbs of pushing and pulling, this is
rather obvious: one can push a cart along a street (accompanied caused movement) or push a
pot over (unaccompanied caused movement). In the case of ‘take’, the lack of specification is
less obvious, and is explained in the following section.

6.6.1.1 Taking

Simple verbs of caused movement are often glossed as ‘get’, ‘take’ or ‘bring’. They are used in
constructions that also profile the source, e.g. ‘he took the knife from the table’, and in
constructions that only profile the caused movement, e.g. ‘he took/brought my knife’.

                                                                          Posture and movement 425

   English _take_ occurs in dozens of idiomatic phrases (_take heart_, _take hold_, _take a sip_,
_take a break_, _take over_, etc), but its core meaning involves accompanied movement by an agent of
something (the theme) from one location to another. Either the source location or the goal
location may be profiled, as for instance, in ‘take it off the ground’ and ‘take it to its mother’.
In this respect Oceanic languages are similar to English. The Vitu (MM) verb _pele-_ is used
with a source in this example. The source is ‘her betelnut basket’.

__igt__
Na tavine hanitu e          pele-a na tureturea na ka-na kolopi mamaha.
ART woman spirit RLS:3 take-3SG ART stamper          PREP PCL-3SG basket chew.betelnut
‘The spirit woman took a stamper from her betelnut basket.’ (129)

However, English _take_ also profiles direction away from the deictic centre, contrasting with
bring, which profiles direction towards it. Oceanic languages, however, encode this deictic
contrast with a deictic direction verb—or a deictic morpheme derived from a verb
(vol.2:273-282)—in the last slot of a serial verb construction, as in these Vitu (MM) examples.

__igt__
Ia       pele-a       vano.
He       take-3SG     go
         MANNER       DEIXIS
‘He took it away.’ (Berg & Bachet 2006:180)

__igt__
Pele-a   haine      mai!
take-3SG iron.spear come
MANNER                     DEIXIS
‘Bring the spear here!’ (Berg & Bachet 2006:181)

This leaves _pele-_ profiling only the means of movement, namely that the agent moves the
theme, i.e. simple caused movement. The verb _pele-_ is the same in all three examples. This is
a typical Oceanic configuration, such that one caused movement verb corresponds to both
English _take_ and _bring_. A practical result of this is that these Oceanic verbs are often glossed
as one or more of ‘take’, ‘get’ and ‘bring’, but the verbs have the same functions whichever
of these glosses is used. Thus the verbs reconstructed here overlap two semantic domains.
The first is ‘reverse putting’, e.g. ‘taking off the table’ as opposed to ‘putting on the
table’ (§6.6.3.1.4), a subdomain of unaccompanied caused movement. The other is carrying
(§6.2), a subdomain of accompanied caused movement.

    A second semantic complication, discussed by D’Jernes (2013) with regard to Lukep
(Pono) _-kaua_/_-kap_ ‘get, give’ (where the first form takes a singular object, the second a plural)
is that a verb meaning ‘take, get’ in some languages also means ‘give’. In others, the ‘give’
verb is derived historically from a ‘take, get’ verb. This is less strange than it appears. If the
basic meaning of these verbs is simply that the agent moves the theme, then the addition of a
recipient is enough to narrow the movement to ‘giving’.[17]

    The verbs reconstructed below also raise formal challenges. Broadly, these are due to the
fact that words of high token frequency may fail to undergo changes that would otherwise
affect them. For example, the Lukep (Pono) pair mentioned above, _-kaua_ and _-kap_, are
exceptional in encoding their object respectively as singular and plural. Lukep (Pono) has
generally lost POc object indexing enclitics, but retains _-a_ 3SG on a small number of now
‘irregular’ verbs (D’Jernes (2002).

[17] Narasimhan et al. (2012:10) note that Tzeltal, a Mayan language of Mexico, has a semantically general
     ‘put’ verb that encompasses both ‘put’ (inanimate goal) and ‘give’ (animate recipient) meanings.

    However, at least one such irregularity originated long before the emergence of POc. Blust
(ACD) reconstructs PAn/PMP _*alap_, PMP _*alaq_ both ‘fetch, get, take’, and PAn _*ala_ ‘take,
get, fetch, obtain’. Their similarities of form and meaning indicate that they have a shared
origin that cannot be reconstructed. PMP _*alap_ and _*alaq_ were both inherited into POc, but
with a complication. The predicted POc transitive forms are _*alap-i-_ and _*alaq-i-_. The
former is reflected in Gela and Tongan (immediately below). But more widely reflected are
forms in which initial _*a-_ has vanished, i.e. _*lap-i-_ and _*la(q)-i-_. The _*a_-less forms evidently
already occurred in POc, and for clarity’s sake are reconstructed separately below

    Three further verbs which, like those above, denote simple caused movement, are

monosyllabic CV form. Most POc roots are polysyllabic. The New Caledonian forms in this

    The exact form of the reconstruction below is not entirely clear. Evidence for the phoneme
following initial _*ka-_ is conflicting. Seimat and Kilivila _kau_, Lukep (Pono) _-kau-a_, Patep _ko_,
Sinaugoro _-ɣau_, Wayan Fijian _kau_ and Samoan _ʔau-mai_ support the reconstruction of POc
_*kʷau_. Other evidence points to a labial, but which labial is unclear. Tuam _ɣam_, Mangap _kam_,
and Nehan _kaba_ support _*kʷabV_, while a number of items indicate _*kʷap_. There are two
possible explanations here. One is that the cognate set reflects more than one POc
morphological variant, just as Lukep (Pono) preserves two variants (D’Jernes 2013). The
other is that this is not one cognate set but two, reflecting similar but separate POc forms. The
forms listed under ‘cf. also’ complicate the picture, but appear to reflect a separate form _*ka[-i-]_.

No verb of lowering can be reconstructed, but a number of languages form a verb ‘lower’ by
attaching a reflex of the POc causative prefix _*pa-_ to a verb meaning ‘be deep’ or ‘go down’.
Examples include Bariai (NNG) _pa-sil_ from _sil_ ‘deep’, Sursurunga (MM) _a-sih-əi_ from _sih_ ‘go
down’, To’aba’ita (SES) _faʔa-sifo-a_ from _sifo_ ‘go, move down, descend, more or less
vertically’.

6.6.1.3 Force-profiling verbs: pushing and pulling

Verbs of pushing and pulling profile the force that the agent exerts on the theme in order to
move it. Whether the agent accompanies the theme along the path of movement is not part of
the verb’s lexical meaning, but is conveyed by the construction in which the verb is used, e.g.
They pulled the canoe up the beach (accompanied caused movement) vs He pulled the bag
open (unaccompanied caused movement).

6.6.1.3.1 Pushing

Oceanic languages tend to have a number of path-profiling verbs of pushing, e.g. ‘push open’,
‘push in’, ‘push through’, ‘push aside’, ‘push away’, ‘push under’, ‘push against’. None of
these can be reconstructed from available data, but these ‘push’ terms from Lou (Adm), Lewo
(NCV) and Sinaugoro (PT) give an indication of one reason for this.

__table__
Lou (Adm) |
_suek_      | ‘push’
_suer_      | ‘push ground’
_susuer_    | ‘push ground with foot’
_suput_     | ‘push away, make go’
_susuŋ_     | ‘push clothes up’

__table__
Lewo (NCV) |
_suponia_    | ‘push’
_suponipu_   | ‘push and turn s.t.’
_supʷoni_    | ‘push, shove’
_susuni_     | ‘move, push’
_suwani_     | ‘push into hole to block it’

Both the lists above, geographically separated as they are, consist of words with initial _su-_. The
fact that so many ‘push’ verbs in each language begin with the same syllable cannot be
coincidence, and probably tells us that these forms reflect earlier nuclear serial verb
constructions, a productive construction in which two verbs formed a compound (Lou _suek_
‘push’ is an exception: _-ek_ reflects the POc applicative suffix _*-aki(n)_). This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that in Sinaugoro, such forms still are transparent compounds where the
second element has its own lexical meaning (forms preceded by a hyphen in the third column
always occur as the final part of a compound).

                                                                  Posture and movement 431


__table__
Sinaugoro (PT)
dori         ‘push’
dori-faka    ‘open by pushing’                faka    ‘between’
dori-ɣau     ‘close by pushing’               -ɣau    ‘cover’
dori-maraɣe ‘push up’                         raɣe    ‘go up’
dori-riɣo    ‘push down’                      riɣo    ‘go down’
dori-rosi    ‘push out’                       -rosi   ‘out’
dori-tari    ‘push down on the ground’        -tari   ‘down’
dori-toɣa    ‘push inside’                    -toɣa   ‘inside’

Sinaugoro _dori_ ‘push’ is not cognate with Lou or Lewo _su-_ but the latter are probably cognate
with each other and probably reflect POc _*qusur_ ‘push, shove’ with loss of the first syllable.
Other Oceanic ‘push’ forms with initial _su(r)-_ are listed under ‘cf. also’.

    A second POc term for ‘push’, _*juju(n)_, _*juni-_ ‘push’, is reconstructed below. There are
some unanswered marginal queries about this reconstruction. It is reflected to my knowledge
in only one non-WOc language, Lau, but Lau does not usually contain WOc loans, and is a
reliable witness. Ughele and Marovo _juno-_ suggest a transitive form †_*juno-_, but all other
reflexes point to instantiation of the paradigm identified by Blust (1977a) (vol.1:25), i.e. the
forms as reconstructed.

6.6.1.3.2 Pulling

_*puti-_ ‘pick (fruit +), pluck (feathers +), pull out (weeds +)’, is widely reflected (vol.1:277–278).
An apparently simple verb of pulling, POc _*Rape_ ‘pull, drag’, has quite widely

6.6.2 Accompanied caused movement

Verbs of accompanied caused movement are verbs of carrying and dragging. Many Oceanic
languages have no default verb of carrying, but employ a number of carrying verbs, depending
on how something/someone is carried and to a lesser degree on what is carried.[18] Meanings that
crop up with considerable frequency include

__block__
- carry on the head
- carry hanging from the head
- carry a child in a sling on the back
- carry on the shoulder
- carry hanging from shoulder
- carry piggyback
- carry with a shoulder pole
- carry on a long shoulder pole between two people
- carry under the arm (and on the hip)
- carry in both arms
- carry on a canoe

Of these, the first three modes listed are usually restricted to women, whilst carrying something
on or hanging from the shoulder is typically a male mode. Hill (2015) remarks, ‘In the villages
of Longgu district there is only one way to transport goods or children on land and that is for
people to carry them. There are no animals used to carry loads, no bicycles, wheelbarrows or
cars.’ This was true of all pre-contact Oceanic speaking communities and was true of
communities speaking POc. Hill goes on to point out that while Longgu does not have a
generic verb ‘carry’, it does have a verb _zabe_ ‘not carry anything’, ‘behavior that is
considered either unusual or unacceptable’ in a community where every able-bodied person
must contribute to the daily labour of the village.

[18] I am indebted to Andrew Pawley for a copy of Pawley (1997), to Deborah Hill for allowing me to read a
     pre-publication draft of Hill (2016), and to people who provided Hill with lists of carrying verbs:
     Wolfgang Sperlich for Nakanai (drawing on Chowning & Goodenough 2014), Ralph Lawton for
     Kilivila and Alexandre François for Hiw.

6.6.2.1 Carrying in general

POc, however, appears to have used _*puat_ as a generic verb of carrying and transporting,
although when the agent was male it apparently also could have the specific meaning ‘carry on
the shoulder’. In its generic sense it probably overlapped with POc _*kʷau_, _*kʷap(i)_ ‘get,
take’ (§6.6.1.1), but the glosses in the cognate set below suggest that generic _*puat_ profiled
carrying or transporting a load, whereas _*kʷau_, _*kʷap(i)_ denoted carrying in a more general
sense.

6.6.2.2 Carrying on the head

The central meaning of POc _*suqun_ was with reasonable certainty ‘carry on the head’, attested
by non-Oceanic cognates from Taiwan to CMP (ACD). In Takia and Megiar the meaning has
been extended to carrying in general. In NCV, as Clark (2009) recognises, the extension is to
wearing on the head, then to wearing in general. That these terms are cognate is confirmed by
the presence of the glottal stop in Namakir _hiʔin_, Namakir being the only NCV language
regularly to reflect POc/PNCV _*q_.

    PWOc _*kud(r)u_ is also reconstructable as a term for carrying on the head. How this
differed in meaning from POc _*suqun_ is not clear, but the Mangap and Nakanai glosses below
note that women carry burdens in this way, and it may be that _*kud(r)u_ denoted a female
carrying style.

6.6.2.3 Carrying hanging from the head

When a woman from New Guinea carries a loaded netbag (_bilum_ in New Guinea Tok Pisin),
she lets it hang down behind her resting on her back and she pulls its woven handle over her
head to rest across her forehead so that the bag is suspended from it. Occasionally other loads
are carried in this way too. Interestingly, no POc term for this mode of carrying can be
reconstructed, and this matches the fact that no term for a netbag can be reconstructed either
(vol.1:79), apparently because the bilum was a New Guinea highland artefact that spread to the
lowlands after the dispersal of Oceanic languages from NW Melanesia. This carrying mode has
spread into the Solomon Islands, but is attested only at odd locations in the north of Vanuatu.

   Some Admiralties and WOc terms for this carrying mode, along with one NCV term, look
as if they are reflexes or borrowings of reflexes of PWOc _*kud(r)u_ ‘carry on the
head’ (§6.6.2.2). Note that Tawala and Gapapaiwa _gedu_ share the replacement of _-u-_ by _-e-_
also found in Iduna _kedu_ above.

The most likely borrowing above is Poeng _kule_ as Poeng _-l-_ reflects POc _*-r-_, _-R-_ or _-l-_ but not
_*-d(r)-_. Significantly Madden (n.d.) annotates this entry with a comment that Poeng speakers
do not normally make or use bilums.

6.6.2.4 Carrying piggyback

The main POc term for carrying someone piggyback (or pick-a-back, the older English form) is
_*pʷa(p,pʷ)a_, which is of PAn antiquity. Its exact POc form is uncertain, as the phonological
evidence is conflicting. At the same time, the similarities in both form and meaning make it
probable that these items form a cognate set. PMP _*baba_ could regularly have become either
POc _*baba_ or _*papa_. Clark (2009) correctly observes that NCV items reflect either PNCV/
POc _*baba_ or PNCV _*bava_ (POc _*bapa_). One might reconstruct alternant POc forms, but
there is a solution which unites the apparently conflicting lines of evidence. Lynch (2002e)
shows that PMP labials surface sporadically as POc labiovelars, and that the reflex of POc _*pʷ_
in WOc languages is often a fortis _p_. The evidence below suggests that the initial POc
consonant was indeed _*pʷ_, an inference supported by the rounded vowels of Poeng _pope_ and
Arosi _boha_. It is less clear whether the medial consonant was _*-pʷ-_ or _*-p-_, as some reflexes are
fortis, others lenis.

   There are also forms reflecting POc _*papa_, but I argue in §6.6.2.5 that these form a
separate cognate set.

6.6.2.5 Carrying a child in a sling on the back

During the research for this chapter the set below was included in the set in §6.6.2.4 above.
Two facts led to its separation and to the reconstruction of POc _*papa_. First, Lonwolwol has
two forms, _baba_ and _fefa_ (N Ambrym _fafa_), admittedly not very different in meaning. Second,
Polynesian forms reflect PPn _*fafa_ rather than _*papa_.

    It may well be that there is a historical connection between POc _*pʷa(p,pʷ)a_ ‘carry pick-a-
back’ and POc _*papa_, tentatively ‘carry a child slung on the back’. It is also possible that
reflexes of one have been contaminated by reflexes of the other.

6.6.2.6 Carrying on the shoulder

See also the generic carrying verb POc _*puat_ (§6.6.2.1), which also seems to have had a
specific use ‘carry on shoulder’.

   The terms listed below reflect POc _*[qa]paRa-_ ‘shoulder’, reconstructed in §3.5.3. It is
possible that the term has been repurposed as a verb at various times and places, but two facts
speak against this. First, all the forms listed reflect _*qapaRa_ rather than simply _*paRa_. As
noted in the reconstruction of _*[qa]paRa-_, there are a number of body-part and other nouns
that are reflected with and without _*qa-_. If the repurposing had taken place on various
occasions, we would expect some reflexes without _*qa-_, but none are found. Second, the
repurposing must be quite old, as the Malalamai, Gapapaiwa and Longgu forms are no longer
used for ‘shoulder’, and the Gumawana, and Misima forms are no longer identical to the noun
‘shoulder’.

6.6.2.9 Carrying on a long shoulder pole between two people

Once a pig has been captured for slaughter, the favourite way to carry it in Melanesian
communities is to tie its legs to a pole, such that the pole can be placed across the shoulders of
two men, standing one behind the other, one at each end of the pole, the pig hanging between
them. Terms for this mode of carrying occur in numerous Oceanic languages, but no extensive
cognate sets are found. The three items below are nonetheless attested.

6.6.2.10 Carrying under the arm (and on the hip)

The stem of POc _*qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_, *qa(p,pʷ)is-i- ‘carry (a child) on the hip or under the arm’ appears to
reflect PAn _*qapiC_/PMP _*qapit_ ‘tongs, anything used to hold things together by
pinching’ (ACD). However, aside from the extension in meaning, this derivation is not
straightforward. An irregular reflex, POc _*kapit_ ‘tongs’; _*kapi(t)_, _*kapit-i-_ ‘grasp (with tongs)’
is reconstructed in vol.1 (p148) (with hindsight this should more accurately be _*ka(p,pʷ)it_ ‘tongs’;
_*ka(p,pʷ)i(t)_, *ka(p,pʷ)it-i-)_. Its irregularity lies in the presence of _*k-_ for expected †_*q-_. The terms
in the set below, however, do reflect _*q-_.

    POc _*qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_, _*qa(p,pʷ)is-i-_ is nonetheless irregular in a different respect. Instead of
stem-final _*-t_ it reflects _*-s_. The one exception is the Teop term under ‘cf. also’ below, which
reflects _*ka(p,pʷ)it-i-_ ‘grasp (with tongs)’. The apparent replacement of _*-t_ by _*-s_ in the POc
form may reflect palatalisation or borrowing at a very early stage, perhaps pre-POc.
Alternatively, the resemblance between _*ka(p,pʷ)it_ and _*qa(p,pʷ)i(s)_ may be a matter of chance.

    Despite its formal similarity to the set above, the cognate set below evidently reflects PMP
_*qabin_ ‘hold or carry under the arm’, POc _*qapi(n)_, _*qapin-i-_ ‘hold or carry under the arm’.
However, contamination from POc _*qapiŋa_ ‘armpit’, itself a nominalisation formed from POc
_*qapi(n)_ (§3.5.4), has evidently occurred in Yalu, Mota, Raga and Rennellese and in the
Dangal and Buang forms under ‘cf. also’, which have _ŋ_ for †_n_. All the forms under ‘cf. also’
reflect _*k-_ rather than †_*q-_, apparently reflecting contamination from POc _*kapi(t)_, _*kapit-i-_
‘grasp (with tongs)’ (vol.1:148).

6.6.2.12 Carrying on a canoe

Blust (ACD) reconstructs three formally similar PMP terms for ‘load a canoe’: _*Rujan_, _*lujan_,
and _*ujan_. He offers no explanation for the existence of three similar forms, and nor can I. In
vol.1 (p198) it was inferred that Oceanic items reflected POc _*lujan_, and _*ujan_. With a better
understanding of Oceanic sound correspondences, _*Rujan_ is inferred here, rather that _*lujan_,
and the two POc forms are reconstructed as _*Rujan_, _*Rujan-i-_ and _*ucan_, _*ucan-i-_, both ‘load
(s.t.) onto a canoe, transport by canoe’. The two reconstructions differ in two consonant
correspondences. The key lies in the medial correspondence. SE Solomonic, Fijian and
Polynesian terms unambiguously reflect POc _*-j-_ and are assigned to a single cognate set,
whose initial consonant correspondence—Proto Southeast Solomonic _*l-_, PCP *0̷- —regularly reflects POc _*R-_.

# FIXME: update/replace/deprecate reconstruction in vol1?

    The second set reflects POc _*ucan_, _*ucan-i-_. Several irregularities in the medial consonant
reflex are noted below, but none is assignable to _*-j-_.

    Finally, the Micronesian set assembled by Bender et al. (2003) may reflect either POc
_*Rujan_ or _*ucan_. POc _*R_ is lost in many Micronesian etyma, while _*c_ and _*j_ are merged
except in Kosraean, which does not have a known reflex of either _*Rujan_ or _*ucan_.

6.6.2.13 Dragging

Dragging is a form of accompanied caused movement, in that the agent follows the same path
as the theme (the thing dragged). In this respect it differs from pulling, where, as with putting,
some part of the agent remains in contact with the theme but the agent doesn’t follow the
theme’s path (§6.6.3). Only one dragging verb is reconstructable, and only to PROc.

>

6.6.3 Unaccompanied caused movement

Verbs of unaccompanied caused movement form two categories, based on whether or not some
part or tool of the agent remains in contact with the theme until the theme reaches its goal. If it
does, then we have a putting verb like put, insert or immerse (§6.6.3.1). If it doesn’t, the verb
is a verb of sending, like send, drop, throw or pour (§6.6.3.2).

6.6.3.1 Putting

‘Putting’ is used here in a specialised sense. The English verb _put_ is ubiquitous. It occurs in
dozens of idiomatic phrases like _put out the light_, _put on clothes_, _put to death_, _put down_
(‘humiliate’), _put out_ (‘annoy’), _put off_ (‘postpone’). Its core meaning, however, has to do with
moving something to a named location, as in put on the table, put into the bag and so on.

    Some verbs of putting profile the resulting posture of the theme, e.g.
_He sat the child on the chair_ (result: the child was sitting on the chair). Others profile the
path to the resulting location, e.g. _He inserted the key into the keyhole_ (result: the key was
in the keyhole).

    Verbs of putting in the world’s languages vary as to whether they have a simple verb of
putting like English _put_, whether they have verbs that specify the target posture of the theme
(i.e. the thing that is put), like German _setzen_ ‘sit, seat’, _stellen_ ‘stand’ and _legen_ ‘lay’, or
whether they have a number of putting verbs that, like insert, specify the path of putting, e.g.
‘put into’, ‘put through’, ‘put on top of’, ‘put down’, ‘put up (e.g. onto a shelf)’, ‘put out (e.g.
to dry)’, ‘put on a pile’ and ‘put in a line’ (Narasimhan et al. 2012).

    These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Oceanic languages tend to be of the
third type, and the list of path-of-putting categories in the previous sentence is based on
Oceanic tendencies. At the same time, most Oceanic languages have a simple ‘put’ verb
(§6.6.3.1.1), and many have verbs for ‘stand (s.t.) (on s.t)’ and ‘lay (s.t.) (on s.t)’ (§6.3.1.2).
Few, however, have a verb for ‘sit (s.t.) (on s.t)’, presumably because, as noted in §2.1, sitting
is typically not encoded by a dedicated verb.

    Oceanic dictionaries sometimes appear to be incomplete when it comes to putting verbs.
One which does contain a comprehensive collection is Pawley & Sayaba’s (2003) dictionary
of Wayan Fijian, which includes the putting verbs tabulated below (two leftmost columns)
together with the bases from which they are derived (third and fourth columns). All have the
theme as their object except _drosomi-_/_drosoti-_ ‘put s.t. inside’, which takes the location as its
object.

    Some interesting patterns emerge from the tabulation. There are far more path-profiling
than posture-profiling verbs. All the verbs listed except the last are derived from a base listed
in the dictionary, and a majority are derived from undergoer-subject verbs (U-verbs;
vol.1:23). Four are derived from a noun denoting the path’s destination. Each of the derived
verbs is simply a transitive form of its base, with the exception of vaka-dureni ‘stand s.t. up,
make s.t. stand’, formed with the causative prefix _vaka-_. The latter is a posture-profiling
putting verb, and supports the view that Wayan Fijian is indeed, in the preliminary typology
of Narasimhan et al. (2012), a language that elaborates path-profiling rather than
posture-profiling verbs of putting.

    None of these observations is inconsistent with the data available for other Oceanic
languages (other than perhaps Polynesian). Certainly, path verbs play a major role
everywhere. Whether they are commonly derived from U-verbs it is impossible to say, as
comprehensive dictionaries are not available for other languages that may share this
derivation. Another extensive set of verbs of putting is from Mangap-Mbula, which, like all
Oceanic languages on or near the New Guinea mainland, does not have U-verbs. and lacks
transitive derivational morphology other than the causative prefix _pV-_, which occurs on three
posture verbs (the language is exceptional in having a ‘sit’ verb here) and two path verbs.
Mangap-Mbula putting verbs are shown in Table 17.

   Simple verbs of putting often occur in serial verb constructions. In terms of the division
into manner (locomotion), path (geographic direction) and deictic direction verbs put forward
in §6.3 on the basis of occurrence in these constructions, simple verbs of putting occupy the
manner slot, i.e. they are verbs of (caused) locomotion. This follows from their encoding the
act of putting and from their lack of directional meaning, as well as from their place in serial
verb constructions.

   Other apparently simple ‘put’ verbs have only two or three known reflexes. However,
whether POc had more than one or two simple ‘put’ verbs is questionable, and it is possible
that both *taRu and the two verbs below each had a more specific meaning.

6.6.3.1.2 Posture-profiling verbs of putting

Assuming that lexical sources are reliable, Oceanic languages have far more underived path-
than posture-profiling verbs of putting. Where posture-profiling ‘put’ verbs occur, they tend to
be transparently derived from posture verbs, as the Wayan and Mangap examples above show.
Other instances include those in Table 18.

No underived POc posture-profiling verbs of putting can be reconstructed, but it is likely that
there were verbs consisting of cardinal posture stems (§2.1–2.3) prefixed by causative _*pa-_.
The data in §6.2.4.3 also suggest that transitive ‘hang’ was formed from an intransitive ‘hang’
verb.


6.6.3.1.3 Path-profiling verbs of putting

Despite the high numbers of verbs of putting in Oceanic languages that specify a path
(§6.6.3.1), only one POc path-profiling verb of putting can be reconstructed, namely _*soŋo_ ‘put
into, insert’.

   At first blush, the absence of POc reconstructions seems to contradict the statement that
Oceanic languages have numerous path-profiling ‘put’ verbs. However, it is probably the very
plethora of such verbs in Oceanic languages that leads ironically to the absence of cognate
sets. The large number of ‘put’ verbs and their propensity to be derived apparently means that
the lexical replacement rate is high in this semantic domain, so that cognates often vanish.

6.6.3.1.4 ‘Putting’ in reverse: removing

‘Removing’ in the title of this section refers to acts of unaccompanied caused movement that
are opposite in direction to ‘putting’ (e.g. _He took the knife from the table_). In §6.6.1.1 it is
argued that POc probably had no simple verb of removing that denoted the reversal of
putting. Instead it had a simple verb of caused movement that covered both the reversal of
putting and accompanied caused motion, i.e. ‘bring’ and ‘take’.

   Across the world’s languages verbs of putting often profile both the path along which the
object is moved and/or its resulting posture, but verbs of removing tend to profile only the
source from which it is moved, not its former posture. Languages in which a verb of
removing also encodes the object’s posture are rare (Narasimhan et al. 2012:10), but one of
them occurs in the heart of Melanesia. In the Papuan language Yélî Dnye, located on the
periphery of WOc, there are verbs meaning both ‘put into’ and ‘take out of’, ‘put onto’ and
‘take off of’, ‘stand/lay/hang at a location’ and ‘unstand/unlay/unhang from a
location’ (Levinson & Brown 2012). Oceanic languages, however, do not resemble Yélî
Dnye in this respect. This is no surprise, as even their verbs of putting tend not to profile
posture (§6.6.3.1.2). Instead, we typically find a simple verb of removing (‘take out of/from/
away’) along with numerous specialised removal verbs, depending on what is being removed
and from where. Many of these verbs concern common domestic processes: removing bark
from wood, removing the husk from a coconut, removing fruit from a branch, removing flesh
from a coconut or a mollusc, removing the stones from an earth oven, or removing the
serrated edge from pandanus leaves. No attempt is made to reconstruct verbs for these
meanings here, because they lie outside the semantic domain with which this chapter is
concerned and are reconstructed elsewhere (vol.1:165–168, 277–279). However, Blust (ACD)
has reconstructed a simple verb of removal, POc _*unus_, _*unus-i-_ ‘withdraw, pull out,
extract’ (I take ‘pull’ in the glosses below simply to be a consequence of caused movement
towards the agent).

‘Send’ verbs denote caused movement where the agent neither accompanies the theme in its
movement nor, unlike ‘put’ verbs, remains in contact with the theme until it reaches its goal. In
this semantic domain one might expect to be able to reconstruct a simple ‘send’ verb and one or
two more verbs whose meaning satisfies these criteria, namely ‘drop’ (‘let fall, cause to fall’)
and ‘throw’.

    Curiously, neither a simple ‘send’ verb nor one meaning ‘drop’ is reconstructable on the
basis of available data. There is no immediately obvious reason for this, as Oceanic languages
often have verbs with each of these meanings, but they do not form widespread cognate sets.
Many ‘send’ verbs appear to reflect the POc causative prefix _*pa[ka]-_ but the roots to which it
is attached do not occur independently in the data. Two that do are Teop (MM) _va-nao_
‘send’ (_nao_ ‘go’) and Wayan Fijian _vā-kauti-_ ‘send s.t., have s.t. carried or taken’ (_kau_ ‘be carried,
taken’). Takia uses a periphrastic causative _-gane -ao_ ‘send’ (_-gane_ ‘do’, _-ao_ ‘go’). A number of
‘drop’ verbs similarly reflect the causative prefix: Poeng (NNG) _pa-pu-e_ ‘drop, cause to fall’
(_pu-pu_ ‘fall’), Iduna (PT) _-ki-ve-beʔu-_ ‘drop from hand, make something fall’ (_beʔu_ ‘fall’, _ki-_ ‘do with
hand’, _ve-_ CAUSATIVE), Misima (PT) _pa-bun_ ‘drop’ (_bun_ ‘fall’), Wayan Fijian _vaka-lutu-ni-_ ‘drop
(s.t.)’ (_lutu_ [VI] ‘drop, fall’). It thus seems possible that POc used causatives for ‘send’ and ‘go’,
and that the plethora of ‘send’ forms in Oceanic languages reflects a re-purposing of other verbs.

    The situation with ‘throw’ and ‘pour’, however, is quite different, perhaps because ‘throw’
also profiles the kind of force applied to the theme and ‘pour’ the action applied to the vessel
containing the liquid.

6.6.3.2.1 Throwing

   It seems fairly clear that throwing stones was a primary sense of POc _*piri(ŋ)_.

6.6.3.2.2 Pouring

Several verbs of pouring can be reconstructed. The most widely reflected is POc _*liŋi(s)_, _*liŋis-i-_
‘pour out, spill (liquid)’. POc _*puRi_ ‘pour water on’ took the goal as its object. PWOc _*jiwaR_,
_*jiwaR-i-_ ‘pour out (liquid)’ is reflected only in WOc languages, and seems to have replaced
_*liŋi(s)_/_liŋis-i-_. It is not clear whether its object was the (liquid) theme or the goal of pouring.
As noted below, it may have an earlier shared history with PCP _*suqi_ ‘pour water on/into’,
which took the goal as its object.

   The relationship, if any, between the two reconstructions below, PNGOc _*jiwaR_, _*jiwaR-i-_
‘pour out (liquid)’ and PCP _*suqi_ ‘pour water on/into’, is somewhat puzzling. Each is based
on a regionally restricted cognate set, and the formal similarities between them suggest that
they may share an earlier history. Indeed, the Fjian (Bauan and Wayan) terms under PCP _*suqi_
could also reflect _*jiwaR-i-_, if one assumes that the sequence _*-iwa-_ is readily reduced to
_*-ua-_ (as in Takia and Sio), then _*-u-_ (as in Kela and Numbami). This would give PCP _*juRi_,
hence, e.g. Wayan _sui_. Concomitantly, _*suqi_ would then be demoted to PPn status. Either way,
though, PPn _*-q-_ cannot be reconciled with PWOc _*-R-_ without resorting to ad hoc
speculation.

7               Physical acts

7.1     Introduction

This chapter presents reconstructions of POc verbs for acts performed with the body or its parts
that do not readily fit into the volume’s other chapters. It is, in a sense, a collection of leftovers,
but it is a collection that has lessons to teach us.

    Terminological reconstruction uses the terminologies of present-day speakers of Oceanic
languages as the basis for constructing a hypothesis about the semantic structure of a
corresponding POc terminology. This is relatively easy to do if we are reconstructing a set of
nouns, like terms for the parts of a canoe (vol.1, ch.7) or the parts of the human body (this
volume, ch.3), as these are objects or entities that can be identified visually. It is more difficult
when the terms to be reconstructed consist of classes of objects or entities, and class
boundaries are determined by cultural and environmental factors, as is true, for example, of
plant (vol.3, ch.3) and animal taxonomies (vol.4, chs.3 and 8), of the times of the day
(vol.2:294–304), and of human age cohorts (this volume, §2.4.1).

    Such classifications differ from one part of the world to another, and sometimes differ
across Oceanic communities too. But these classifications can often also be related to objects
or entities that have material existence. Verbs, however, denote events and states. Some of the
semantic distinctions they make relate to events with physical components (‘winds blow’,
‘people urinate’), but others are more abstract. The more abstract they are, the more careful we
need to be not to assume that distinctions encoded by English verbs are similarly encoded by
verbs in Oceanic languages and the more semantic change we find reflected across Oceanic
cognate sets. To draw examples from this short chapter, Oceanic languages tend to encode
‘beckon’ and ‘wave’ by the same verbs (§7.3.1), and this is also true of ‘slap’ and
‘clap’ (§7.4.1). Acts of washing in Oceanic languages defy single-verb English translations
(§7.6).

    The somewhat abstract nature of verb meanings means that the internal classification and
even the grammatical encoding of a whole domain may be quite different from its
classification and encoding in English. For example, many Oceanic languages use serial verb
constructions to encode movement, thereby partitioning meanings into manner of movement,
geographic direction of movement, and deictic direction of movement (vol.2:256–283 and this
volume, §§6.3–6.4), with verbs (or directional morphemes) that occupy each slot in the
construction.

    A second effect of the abstract nature of verb meanings, however, is that verbs cannot
always be neatly assigned to terminologies, as they sometimes overlap more than one
semantic domain. Verbs meaning ‘wait’ and ‘hide’ both have a location component. In this
they resemble the posture verbs discussed in §6.2, but neither has a posture component.
Instead, ‘wait’ has a component of expectation which in certain contexts allows interpretation
as a verb of cognition (ch.10), whilst intransitive ‘hide’ resembles a location verb (§6.2) and
transitive ‘hide’ a putting verb (§6.6.3.1), but both entail the element of concealment from
certain people.

458 Malcolm Ross

    Most of the verbs in this section are verbs that defy neat assignment. Verbs of working
(§7.2.2) arguably belong with the verbs associated with horticultural practices (vol.1:129–134),
as POc speakers—unsurprisingly—had no concept corresponding to ‘work’ in its
western sense. The closest equivalent was ‘work in the food garden’. The pair of verbs
meaning ‘clap hands’ and ‘slap with open hand’ in §7.4.1 properly belongs with verbs of
hitting in vol.1:267–274, and is a corrigendum in the light of more data to a reconstruction
presented there.

    All the reconstructions in this chapter denote physical acts, beginning in §7.2 with the most
general of these, verbs of doing and working. Then follow two sections on actions done with
the hand or arm: beckoning, waving, fanning, seizing and taking hold of, and grasping and
holding (§7.3), clapping, slapping and tickling (§7.4). Section 7.5 contains verbs of stamping
and treading on, these being the only foot and leg actions that do not fit neatly into manner-of-
movement verbs in §6.3. Section 7.6 similarly deals with actions in water that do not belong in
the Oceanic manner-of-movement category. Section 7.7 contains the verbs of waiting and
hiding briefly discussed above.


7.2     Doing and working

7.2.1 Doing

Probably every Oceanic language has a verb meaning ‘do’. Its most common use is with a
nominal object denoting an activity, especially in phrases meaning ‘do work’. In many
languages it also occurs in the question ‘What are you doing?’ but this usage is somewhat less
widespread, as a number of Oceanic languages have an interrogative verb ‘do what?’.

   It is clear that POc _*pai(t)_/_*pait-i-_ can be reconstructed, but it is striking that there are large
geographic gaps in the distribution of its reflexes, pointing to widespread lexical replacement
leading to numerous local cognate sets but none that unambiguously reconstructs to PROc,
PEOc or PWOc, let alone POc. This is probably a result of the fact that in ‘do’ + nominal
syntagms, ‘do’ is frequent and typically unstressed. It is therefore subject to phonological
reduction which encourages replacement. There is, for example, a scattering of forms with the
template _*gV_: Takia (NNG) _-ga[ne]_, Iduna (PPT) _-ga_, Nakanai (MM) _igo_, all meaning ‘do,
make’, and Tolo (SES) _ago_ ‘work’, but their monosyllabicity and the mismatches among their
vowels suggest that they could readily be due to independent parallel development.

7.2.2 Working

Pre-contact Oceanic languages had no term for ‘work’ in its Western senses of ‘work as
opposed to leisure’ or ‘work as gainful employment’. The closest concept, and one the term for
which has in some languages been extended to include gainful employment, is that of labouring
in the garden to grow food crops, and especially working to clear land for a garden.

    The POc verb for ‘work in the food garden’ was identical in form to the noun for ‘food
garden’ (vol.1:117–118), _*quma_.

The terms for ‘food garden’ in three MM languages are nominalisations formed with the
nominalising infix _*<in>_ and _*quma_, indicating that in the early MM linkage, _*quma_ was a verb
meaning ‘make a garden’. The three forms that reflect _*q<in>uma_ ‘garden’ are Bulu _ɣ<in>uma_,
Kia _(n-un)uma_ and Roviana _(in)uma_, all ‘food garden’.

   A second term for working in the garden is found in a number of PT languages and MM
languages of northern New Ireland which appears to reflect WOc _*pai-sok_, _*pai-sok-i_ ‘plant
(tuber +)’.

The etymology of these terms is complex and not entirely clear. Their shape suggests that they
reflect a compound, as morpheme-internal _*-ai-_ is not a usual part of the POc phonological
template. An obvious candidate for the first morpheme is POc _*pai(t)_ ‘do, make’, reconstructed
above in §7.2.1. However, the MM forms bear an obvious resemblance to the set reflecting
POc _*paso(k)_, _*pasok-i_ below, an expanded version of the set in vol.1:132. POc _*paso(k)_ has
a history as a unitary morpheme, and to account for PWOc _*pai-sok_, folk etymologising must
be assumed, whereby _*paso(k)_ was reanalysed as _*pa-(a)so(k)_, consisting of _*pa-_, the POc
causativiser, and the root POc _*asok_ ‘plant in holes in the ground’ (ACD).[1] The prefix _*pa-_ was
then replaced by _*pai-_.

There remains the question of the origin of the apparent PT reflexes of PWOc _*pai-sok_ listed
above. First, a majority of PT languages reflects an innovation whereby _*-a_ is added after a
PWOc final consonant, i.e. PWOc _*paisok_ > _*paisoka_. There is also a tendency for _*k_ to
become _*kʷ_ next to a rounded vowel, hence _*paisokʷa_. Medial _*-k-_ was deleted through
lenition, giving _*paisowa_, the form reflected by Bunama _paihowa_. Finally, vowel unrounding
adjacent to a rounded consonant (_*w_, _*kʷ_ etc) is widespread in PT, giving _*paisewa_.

7.3       Hand and arm actions

Hand and arm actions for which reconstructions are given in this section include beckoning and
waving (often the same verb), fanning, taking hold of, seizing by force, and holding something
in one’s hand. Verbs meaning ‘point (at)’ are not given here but are listed as part of the cognate
set supporting POc _*tusu-_ (N) ‘forefinger’; _*tusuq-i-_ (VT) ‘point at’ in §3.6.8.2.

7.3.1 Beckoning and waving

POc speakers perhaps had two beckoning gestures. In one, the hand was extended palm down,
in the other, hand up. In traditional Oceanic societies (and in SE Asia), the beckoning palm
down is the polite gesture, whilst beckoning palm up, European-style, particularly with an
extended forefinger, is considered rude. There are a few indications among the glosses of
reflexes (Babatana, Longgu, Marshallese) that POc _*qalo(p)_, _*qalop-i-_ denoted beckoning with
the palm down. However, it seems possible that it also had the generic meaning of waving or
making hand gestures.

    Alongside POc _*qalo(p)_ we also find _*ta(Ra)-qalo(p)_ (VI) ‘beckon, wave’. The function of
the prefixed element is not understood,[2] and it is not clear how the prefixed and intransitive
unprefixed forms differ in meaning.

   POc _*kamo(t)_, _*kamot-i-_ may have denoted the impolite beckoning style, with the palm
turned up and forefinger extended, but this is attested only by the Kove gloss. In Polynesian
languages reflexes of this term denote both hand and eye signals. The Rennellese reflex
denotes the polite beckoning style, but this may be the result of an extension in meaning from
impolite beckoning to hand and eye signals in general.

   Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP _*away_ ‘beckon with the hand’ and PMP _*kaway_ ‘wave the
hand or arms; call by waving’. The morphological relationship between the two is uncertain:
they may reflect the same Austronesian root (Blust 1988). A few Oceanic reflexes of _*kaway_
are found, allowing reconstruction of POc _*kawe_ ‘wave the hand’. There are also reflexes of
an apparent POc _*dawe_, perhaps descended from a PMP form reflecting the same
Austronesian root, but in the absence of non-Oceanic reflexes this can be reconstructed only to
PNGOc.

7.3.2 Fanning

The commonest fan in Oceanic speaking communities is probably one made from the coconut
frond.

     Reflexes of POc _*iri(p)_, _*irip-i-_ (V) ‘fan’ and its nominalisations are common in EOc
languages. If the analysis of Lou _tɛrip_ and Nyindrou _taleh_ as reflexes of the root _*irip_,
prefixed with _*ta-_ SPONTANEOUS (§1.3.5.4), are correct, then the form _*ta-irip-i-_ ‘fan oneself’
is reconstructable to POc. However, this analysis presupposes an early Oceanic form _*ta-iripV_
in order to account for the retention of Lou and Nyindrou _-p_, and it is not clear why there
should have been a final vowel here.

                                                                                        Physical acts 465

   The final consonants of PMP _*irid_ and POc _*irip_ do not match, but the Oceanic evidence
supports only _*irip_.[3]

   There are no known WOc reflexes of _*irip_, which seems to have been replaced by PWOc

7.3.3 Seizing, grabbing, snatching, taking hold of

A good many Oceanic languages make a distinction between a verb meaning ‘take hold of’ and
one meaning ‘hold’. POc verbs that evidently meant ‘hold’ are found in §7.3.4. POc _*lawe_
meant ‘take hold of’, whilst POc _*paRo_ appears to have denoted seizing something violently.

7.3.4 Grasping, gripping, holding with hand

Four verbs in the semantic domain ‘hold in the hand’ are reconstructed below. They are POc
_*qabi_ ‘take hold of, grasp’, POc _*tau(r)_/_*taur-i-_ ‘hold (in hand)’, POc _*poso_ ‘hold’, POc
_*gogo(m)_/_*gom-i_ ‘hold in the fist’. It is difficult to assign more precise meanings to them, but
the meaning ‘hold in the fist’ for POc _*gogo(m)_ is strengthened by that of non-Oceanic
cognates.

   Blust (ACD) reconstructs POc _*qabi_ and POc _*abi_, both ‘take hold of, grasp’, and POc
_*abit_ ‘hold, get, take’, reflecting PMP _*ambit_ ‘seize with the hands’. On the assumption that
the cognate set below reflects a single POc form, the data attest POc _*qabi(t)_, _*qabit-i-_.
Root-final _*-t_ is attested in the Lenakel forms.[4] This suggests that the PMP reconstruction should be
_*qambit_.

7.4      Interpersonal actions

This section is concerned with acts that people perform on each other, again with the hands.
Verbs of hitting are reconstructed in vol.1:271–274. Not all of these are typically used of hitting
a fellow human being, but one that is is reconstructed afresh in §7.4.1 in the light of a much
expanded data base. A term that might have found its way into this section is ‘stroke’ (in the
sense of running one’s hand over part of another’s body), but the only relevant POc
reconstruction is _*samo(s)_, _*samos-i-_ ‘massage, stroke’, reconstructed in §5.4.2.2.
Reconstructing a verb for ‘tickle’ raises a formal challenge that is discussed in §7.4.2.

7.4.2 Tickling

The collection of Oceanic items considered here is better described as a set of lookalikes than
as a cognate set, as it includes instances where regular sound changes have simply not taken
place and perhaps also instances where idiosyncratic changes have occurred. This appears to
be the result of onomatopoeia, such that the overall shape of a word is retained but some
phonological contrasts are unimportant. Clearly this was already the case in PMP, as Blust
(ACD) reconstructs _*kilik_, _*kirik_, _*kidi_, _*gidik_ and _*giri_, all ‘tickle’. The onomatopoeic
template is clear: _*KiRi(k)_, where _*K_ is a velar stop, voiced or unvoiced, and _*R_ is a voiced
apical (PMP _*l_, _*r_ or _*d_). These shapes survive remarkably well into Oceanic, despite the
fact that PMP _*k-_ and _*g-_ regularly merge then split into POc _*k-_ and _*g-_ with a strong
preference for POc _*k-_, whilst PMP _*-d-_ and _*-r-_ normally merge as POc _*-r-_. This implies
that onomatopoeic terms for ‘tickle’ have not been affected by regular sound changes.

    Partly as a means of simplifying presentation, I reconstruct POc forms below, but because
regularity of sound change does not apply, there is no guarantee that a given item is directly
descended from the reconstruction under which it is listed. It follows from this that there is
also no guarantee that the reconstructions are correct, especially where there are fewer
reflexes.

The items listed under ‘cf. also’ immediately above may reflect either _*kili(k)_ or _*kiri(s)_.

    The three putative POc forms above have reasonable support both from reflexes and from
non-Oceanic cognates. But their root-final consonants are perhaps also significant. If the
root-medial liquid is _*-l-_, then the root-final consonant is _*-k_, but if the root-medial liquid is _*-r-_,
then the root-final consonant is _*-s_. This suggests two distinct early Oceanic templates, _*Kilik_
and _*Kiris_.

    There is a variety of other Oceanic forms that conform to one of these templates but
reflect the ‘wrong’ protoform. The items below are shown with in the fifth column the POc
forms they reflect if regular sound changes are applied. All the latter display medial _*-d(r)-_,
but it seems somewhat unlikely that such protoforms ever occurred, as they would reflect
PMP _*Kindis_, for which there is no evidence. The hypothetical forms in the sixth column are
the forms expected if regular sound changes had applied to the template _*Kiris_. It is fairly
obvious that Mussau _kiri_, Halia _giri-_ and Paamese _kir-kiris-i_ reflect the failure of a sound
change to apply to the medial _*-r-_. Dawawa _gidi_ perhaps reflects the formation of a new
template _*Kidi_, which was also the antecedent of Mwotlap _ɣin-ɣin_. Voiced stops normally
occur in Gapapaiwa only in loans from nearby PT languages, but _gidi_ may reflect the presence
of unusual sounds in an onomatopoeic item.

7.5     Foot and leg actions

A good many actions of the feet and legs are obviously verbs of locomotion like ‘walk’, ’step’,
‘run’, ‘crawl’, ‘limp’ and ‘hop’, for which reconstructions are presented in §6.3, and
‘wade’ (§6.3.3.2). Dancing is an activity with substantial cultural associations in Oceanic
communities, and belongs in vol.6. This section was planned to deal with the remainder:
kicking, stamping and treading on. However, no cognate sets with the narrow meaning ‘kick’
have been found. When someone deliberately kicks something or someone, this is often
expressed with ‘hit with the foot’, and some reflexes of verbs for stamping and treading on
sometimes have as one of their senses ‘kick with the sole of the foot’. Hence the
reconstructions in this section both relate to stamping and treading on: POc _*paRas_ (VI) ‘step,
tread’, _*paRas-i-_ (VT) ‘step on, tread on’ and PEOc _*butu_ (VI) ‘stamp foot, tread, kick’,
_*butuR-i-_ ‘stamp on, tread on, trample’.

7.6      Bathing and washing

Like §7.5, the present section presents reconstructions for verbs encoding concepts other than
locomotion. Hence reconstructions for verbs of swimming, moving about under water, and
floating are given in §6.3.3. They include POc _*tuRu(p)_ ‘wade’ and POc _*kaRu_, POc _*qasa_
and PEOc _*olo_, all ‘swim’. The reconstructions in this section are actions involving water but
not locomotion, and fall into two semantic sets: verbs denoting bathing, i.e. washing one’s body
by immersion in water (§7.6.1), and verbs denoting the washing of either part of the body or an
object (§7.6.2).

7.6.1 Bathing, immersing oneself

In traditional Oceanic societies the characteristic method of washing oneself all over is to
immerse oneself in a river or, failing that, in the sea. On the basis of the glosses of their reflexes
two reconstructions seem to have been terms primarily for washing oneself or someone else,
typically a child, in this way. They are POc _*siu-siu_ ‘wash oneself’/_*siuw-i-_ ‘wash s.o’ and
POc _*ri-riu(s)_ ‘wash, bathe’/_*rius-i-_ ‘wash s.o., bathe s.o.’ There is a note in Hutchisson’s
Sursurunga dictionary file that _siwi_, the reflex of _*siuw-i-_, is a generic term for washing, and
this was evidently true of the POc form too.

    The transitional consonant _*-w-_ in _*siuw-i-_ reflects a minor reconstructive challenge. PMP
_*ziuq_ shows final _*-q_, but there is no reflex thereof in Oceanic reflexes. Instead, Oceanic
reflexes point to _*-p_. However, I infer that pre-POc _*siu-i_ acquired a transitional [w] which
was strengthened to Tolai and PEOc bilabial fricative _*-v-_.

   POc _*su-su(p)_, _*sup-i-_ below is phonologically very similar to _*siu-siu_, _*siuw-i-_ above,
and it is tempting to assume that the disyllabic root _*siu_ [*siju] has been reduced from
disyllable to monosyllabic _*[sju]_, then, because the latter conflicts with Oceanic phonotactics,
to *[suː]. This might have resulted in alternant forms in POc or have happened on various
occasions post-POC. However, there is reason to think that this inference is wrong. Reflexes
of _*siu-siu_, _*siuw-i-_ all have to do with washing. Reflexes of _*su-su(p)_, _*sup-i-_ point to a
semantic element of submersion and diving as well as of washing. Moreover, Gela has
contrasting reflexes of _*siuv-i-_ and _*sup-i-_.

   POc _*sugu(p)_, _*sugup-i-_ below appears to have been identical in meaning with POc
_*su-su(p)_, _*sup-i-_ immediately above. If there is a historical connection between them, however, it
is difficult to see what it is. Neither has known non-Oceanic cognates, and one can only
speculate that two POc dialects perhaps borrowed cognate terms from neighbouring Papuan
languages. The Tongan and Niuean reflexes below reflect PPn _*uku_ rather than expected
_*huku_ (which Tongan and Niuean would reflect as _huku_).

   The forms in initial _ñ-_ and _n-_ listed below under POc _*ñu-ñu(p)_/_*ñup-i-_, _*ñugu-i-_ and
_*ñulu-i-_ presented a reconstructive problem, as the non-initial consonants do not correspond.
The transitive verbs below are each followed by a parenthesised protoform from which they
could be descended. At first sight, these appear chaotic, but two sets of facts conspire to
provide a solution. The first is that an initial _*ñ-_ on a verb sometimes reflects the application
of the PMP actor-voice formative _*[pa]N-_ (vol.1:29–30) to a root with initial _*s-_. The second
is that the non-initial consonants are identical to those found in _*s_-initial forms with the same
meanings, including _*sup-i-_ and _*sugu-i-_ reconstructed above. The hypothesis that emerges is
that the transitive forms in _*ñ-_ reflect application of _*[pa]N-_ to _*s_-initial roots. It is difficult to
be certain how the fragmentary survivals from the PMP system worked in POc, but it is
reasonable to infer that, for example, _*ñu-ñu(p)_ was the actor-voice intransitive form, _*sup-i-_
the transitive (see the discussion of intransitive and transitive forms of the verb ‘eat’ in
§4.3.1.1). This implies that reduplicated intransitive forms like E Kara _su-suf_ and Vurës
_suv-suv_, listed above under POc _*su-su(p)_/_*sup-i-_, were back formations created from transitive
_*sup-i-_ corresponding intransitives, by applying the POc pattern noted in vol.1:25 (see also
Evans 2003:81–84). Similarly, transitives like Seimat _nuh-i_ and Baluan _nup_ reflect the
converse application of this pattern to intransitive _*ñu-ñu(p)_. The fact that two POc verb pairs,
_*su-su(p)_/_*sup-i-_ and _*ñu-ñu(p)_/_*ñup-i-_ can be reconstructed suggests that these processes
occurred at some pre-POc stage.

The third of these sets, supporting the reconstruction of _*ñulu-i-_, does not correspond to a form
in _*s-_ reconstructed above. Instead we find three Admiralties forms reflecting _*ñ-_ and three
New Ireland (MM) forms reflecting _*s-_ which together allow us to reconstruct two POc
transitive forms, _*ñulu-i-_ and _*sulu-i-_ ‘wash s.o.’.

   POc _*su-su(p)_/_*sup-i-_ and POc _*sugu(p)_/_*sugup-i-_, both reconstructed above, denoted
bathing but also had a more specialised sense of swimming. The gloss of the Nakanai reflex of
POc _*lo-loso(p)_ suggests by contrast that it denoted bathing with a more specialised sense of
swimming, perhaps under the surface. In a number of Vanuatu languages the main sense is
now ‘swim’.

   There is a small doubt about the formal reconstruction of POc _*kʷaya_, as NNG languages
have initial _w-_, most non-NNG languages _k-_. However, the latter are fortis reflexes (rather than
lenis _ɣ-_ or _ʔ-_), and thus plausible reflexes of _*kʷ-_.

7.6.2 Washing and cleaning

In contrast to the terms reconstructed in §7.6.2, the terms presented in this section denote
washing one’s hands or face and sometimes washing objects. When they denote washing
objects, it is fairly common to find reflexes with glosses that also mention rubbing something to
get it clean, suggesting that their central meaning is one of cleaning in general, not just of
washing.

    Various scholars have suggested that the particular reflex of POc _*wasi-_ known to them
(e.g. Lichtenberk 2008) is borrowed from English wash via the local pidgin. However, the
collection of reflexes below suggests that a POc term is reconstructable, and that the
resemblance between its reflexes and, e.g., Vanuatu Bislama wasem is a matter of chance.

7.7       Verbs with a location component

The verbs reconstructed below, translated as ‘hide’ and ‘wait’, each have a semantic component
of location, but not of posture.

7.7.1 Wait

One waits somewhere for something to happen. Semantically the verb has both a locational
component (being somewhere) and a cognitive component (expecting an event). Just one POc
verb is reconstructed with this sense.

[6] John Lynch points out that Naman _tərav_, Uripiv _e-triv_, Tirax _trɛv_, Nisvai _tarv-i_ appear to reflect _*tarav_, while
    Neve’ei _terax-en_, Big Nambas, Tape _tərax_ reflect _*tarak_. These forms are all from Malakula, and we can
    offer no account of them.

Motu (PT) _nari_ (VI) ‘wait’, may be the sole reflex of a POc morphological intransitive _*nari_
(reflecting _*[pa]N-_ + _*tari_) (§1.3.5.6).

7.7.2 Hiding

Oceanic languages preserve reflexes of three POc forms descended from PMP _*buni_ ‘hide,
conceal’. Two of these are _*puni_ and _*muni_. Their origin, briefly mentioned in §1.3.5.5, is
transparent. POc _*puni_ was the root form, reflecting PMP _*buni_, and was originally transitive.
POc _*muni_ reflected PMP _*m-uni_, the outcome of adding the actor-voice infix _*<um>_ to the
root _*puni_, to form an intransitive, involving a morphophonemic rule whereby _*<um>_ + _*p-_
became _*m-_. Probably this transitive/intransitive contrast was maintained in POc, as it survives
in Siar (MM) _mumun_ (VI) vs _wun_ (VT) (Frowein 2011:94), but, as the cognate sets below show,
various languages have created an intransitive from _*puni_ and a transitive from _*muni_, with or
without a derivational morpheme.

    The third POc form descended from PMP _*buni_ ‘hide, conceal’ is POc _*buni_. This is
almost certainly not a direct descendant of PMP _*buni_, as POc _*puni_ has that privilege.
Instead, it appears from the glosses of its reflexes to be an alternant to _*muni_, i.e. an
intransitive. The best hypothesis to account for it is that it arose at a pre-POc stage when
marking intransitive with _*<um>_ was at least still partially productive, but instead of _*m_
replacing _*p-_ (the effective outcome of the rule mentioned above), it was added to it to form
pre-POc _*mpuni_, which by regular sound change became _*buni_.

8                Perception

8.1      Introduction[1]

This chapter investigates verbs of perception in Proto Oceanic, based on a comparison of a
sample of daughter languages. A full comparative study of the morphology, syntax and
semantics of this set of verbs in Oceanic languages would require a book. Here we offer an
introductory account, focusing mainly on certain basic semantic and grammatical features of
perception verbs, and building on the work of Bethwyn Evans (2003), whose study of verb
classes and valency-changing devices in Proto Oceanic includes a section on several verbs of
perception.

    Since Aristotle, Western scholars have generally assumed that humans have five basic
senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste and feeling by touch. In a basic sensing event there is an
animate participant, the experiencer, who by means of a body part (eye, ear, nose, tongue,
skin) becomes aware of a separate participant (the stimulus or source). Neurophysiological
research shows that the five senses scheme is too simple. People have additional physiological
systems for sensing pain, temperature, balance and awareness of how our body and limbs are
moving (proprioception).

    Languages of the world generally give these non-basic senses different grammatical
treatment from the basic senses. There are a number of possible explanations for this. Firstly,
no readily-recognised sense organs are participants in sensations that come through these other
physiological systems. Secondly, sensations such as pain, dizziness, and feeling cold are
involuntary, whereas in the case of seeing, hearing, smelling etc. the experiencer may initiate
the process and at least has a measure of control over it. Third, whereas the stimulus or source
of a basic sensory experience is typically an identifiable entity outside the experiencer’s own
body (the thing seen, heard etc.) the source of non-basic sensations like pain, cold or dizziness
is not external and may not be identifiable. Because the sensations may be prolonged, they are
often treated as states and the focus tends to be on their effect on the body. Thus in English we
typically describe feeling pain, fear, cold, itchiness and dizziness in terms of the experiencer or
a body-part being in a state or condition, which is expressed by a predicate adjective (‘My hip
is quite painful’, ‘Are you cold?’, ‘Mary is dizzy’) whereas for the primary sensing events we
tend to use active verbs/verbs with the experiencer as actor (‘I saw/heard John’), rather than
adjectival predicates with the experiencer as involuntary recipient of the stimulus (‘John is
visible/audible to me’).

    for helpful comments.

    The present paper will deal mainly with the treatment of the five basic senses in Oceanic
languages and with the question of whether the different senses receive similar grammatical
and semantic treatment.

    Basic perception verbs vary conceptually along a number of parameters. These are
illustrated in English in the following paradigm, closely based on that proposed by Viberg
(1984). We have labelled the variables as i) sensing, ii) attending and iii) stimulus-subject.[2]

: Table 19       English perception verbs (based on Viberg’s basic paradigm of verbs of perception)

__table__
Sense modality | Sensing                      | Attending              |    Stimulus-subject
sight          | I see many people            | I look at the film     |    The film is visible/looks blurry.
hearing        |  I hear bells                | I listen to the tune   |     The tune is audible/sounds  loud.
smell          |  I smell smoke               | I smell the milk (to see if it is sour)     |    The milk is smelt?/smells sour
taste          |  I taste garlic              | I taste the mixture (to check if enough salt)  |     The mixture is tasted/tastes fine.
touch          |  I feel the wind in my hair. |    I feel the fabric    |    The fabric is felt?/feels velvety.

    Some languages distinguish lexically or grammatically between two kinds of perception
events involving the basic senses: _sensing_ and _attending_. A verb or verbal clause depicting a
_sensing_ event focuses on the animate participant’s experiencing of the stimulus; it is neutral as
to whether this experience was intentional or accidental. In the case of an _attending_ event, by
contrast, an experiencer is depicted as intentionally focusing on a target. Languages may
express the difference lexically, as is done in the English verbs _see_ vs _look_ and _hear_ vs _listen_,
but not in the verbs _smell_, _taste_ or _feel_, where the same term can be used for both sensing and
attending. In either event the experiencer will be subject of the verb, and the verb will usually
be transitive. A matter to be investigated is the way in which intent is signalled in the basic
sensory verbs in Oceanic languages, and its corollary, whether, for each of the basic senses, a
language will use the same verb for both sensing and attending events.

    We may define a canonical perception verb (and clause) cross-linguistically as one that has
the perceiver (experiencer) as the highest ranked argument (the subject in nominative-accusative
languages). However, it is common to find other kinds of clauses used to represent
perceptions. When the focus shifts from the performance of the act to some conclusion, the
source of the perception, the stimulus, will be subject and the verb will be intransitive. Focus
may then, at least for sight and hearing, be limited to acknowledgement of the perception ‘it is
seen/it is heard’ or even acknowledgement of the ability to be perceived ‘it is visible/audible’.
More commonly, further information may be given by a qualifier in the case of all five senses
‘it looks fine/it sounds awful/it smells sour etc.’. The degree to which languages use the same
verb polysemously varies widely. In English, for example, _smell_, _taste_ and _feel_ can all be used
with experiencer or stimulus as subject, while see and hear may use a related or different
lexeme for stimulus-subject.

[2] Viberg uses the following labels: Experience (= sensing), Activity (= attending) and Copulative (=
    stimulus-subject).

                                                                                  Perception 491


    When dealing with an intransitive verb in many Oceanic languages, one must ask: Is this
verb active or stative? Does it take as subject (or highest-ranked argument) an Actor or an
Undergoer? The intransitive forms of many verbs of process or change of state, such as those
that mean ‘open’, ‘close’, ‘break’, ‘cut’, ‘split’, ‘burn’ and ‘block’ are typically stative, taking
as subject the thing that undergoes the process. Many intransitive verbs, both active and
stative, can be transitivised by adding (a) a transitive suffix of the form _–i_ or _–(C)i_ (where _C_ is
a variable consonant) and (b) an object pronoun suffix or clitic; or simply by adding (b).

    Sometimes a language will use a single perception verb form polysemously to represent
two or three basic senses and sometimes also to represent cognitive processes like knowing,
thinking, understanding and remembering, and cultural practices like obeying, paying
attention and learning. Given that sensory verbs are often polysemous in these ways, the
question arises whether there is a universal hierarchy within which senses are ordered, which
will predict the direction of semantic extension. Viberg (1984) finds some evidence for the
following hierarchy: sight > hearing > touch > smell, taste. This hierarchy implies that vision
has primacy over the other senses, such that a verb of seeing may be extended to refer to at
least certain senses lower on the scale, but not the reverse. Hearing in turn has primacy over
touch, smell and taste.

    With these issues in mind, let us turn to the Oceanic languages. Our project is hampered by
the fact that dictionaries and grammars of Oceanic languages seldom provide careful and
detailed descriptions of the grammar and semantics of verbs of perception. Dictionary entries
often fail to state whether a particular verb is transitive or intransitive, and derived forms are
often not given full glosses. In some cases these gaps in the data limit our ability to make
secure reconstructions.


8.2     Seeing

All Oceanic languages have at least one transitive verb whose primary sense is ‘see s.t.’ (and
which may also mean ‘look at s.t.’). The experiencer is the subject and the source/stimulus the
direct object. Typically they also have a number of transitive verbs for intentional visual
activities comparable, for example, to English ‘peer’, ‘peep’, ‘glance’, ‘gaze’ and ‘stare’. Verbs
which we might call ‘verbs of directed looking’ (_look around_, _up_, _down_, _in_, _out_, _over_, _away_, _into_
etc.) are likely to be expressed in Oceanic languages by a serial verb construction or by a
combination of verb and directional marker (cf. Ross 2003b:256; Ross 2004a).

    Verbs of seeing and looking may also be used intransitively with the perceiver as subject.
Examples are Motu _ita_ (VI) ‘see, look’, _ita-i-_ (VT) ‘look at s.t.’, Arosi _rio_ (VI) ‘see’, _rios-i_ (VT)
‘look at s.t.’, and Wayan Fijian _tola_ ‘see, look’, _tolav-i-_ ‘see s.t.’.

    POc _*kita_ (VI) ‘see’, _*kita-i-_ (VT) ‘see s.t.’ is a well-supported reconstruction with reflexes
in both Western Oceanic and Eastern Oceanic languages. It is also noteworthy that a number
of Eastern Oceanic languages have extended the meaning of their reflexes to include ‘know’
and ‘understand’.[3]

    There are a number of competing reconstructions with some claim to be the general term for
‘see’. Reflexes of _*kita_ and _*reki[-]_ (with doublet _*reqi[-]_) occur almost in complementary
distribution (with some overlap in North New Guinea), and a distinction in meaning between
them cannot be clearly identified. Both _*reki[-]_ and _*reqi[-]_ are reconstructable to POc with no
clear difference in meaning. Only Bugotu and Gela reflect both members of this pair with the
reflex of _*reki[-]_ referring to seeing and the reflex of _*reqi_ to directed looking.

[3] Some Proto Central Pacific languages identify a “sixth sense”. PCP _*ki[t,d]a-vi_ (VT) ‘to sense without
    actually seeing, hearing, etc., have a premonition that s.t. will happen’, is reconstructable based on
    reflexes in Bauan and Wayan Fijian, Tongan, Samoan, Maori and Rarotongan. This is doubtless cognate
    with POc _*kita_ ‘to see’.

   Another putative POc reconstruction, _*ta(d,dr)aq_ has reflexes in a number of Meso-Melanesian
languages that predominantly mean ‘see’. In other subgroups its reflexes more
often mean ‘look at’, ‘observe’ (Micronesian) or to ‘look upwards’ (North New Guinea and
South East Solomonic). If POc _*ta(d,dr)aq_ proves to be related to PMP _*tiŋadaq_ ‘look up,
look skyward’, reconstructed by Dempwolff (1938), it would support the ‘look upwards’
gloss.

   Proto Oceanic also had a number of lexemes of visual perception carrying additional

_*(s,j)ila(k)_ ‘look sideways, glance around’. Similarities of form between _*tirop_, _*kilop_ and

The Wayan verb _kilāti-_ ‘know’ conflates a form reflecting _*kilat_ with the sense ‘know’, the result
perhaps of a blending of a reflex of _*kilat_ with a reflex of _*kila[la]_ ‘know’ (§10.2).

    Polynesian reflexes of POc _*(s,j)ila(k)_ ‘glance around’ sometimes refer to the mental
attitudes attributed to someone glancing at something or somebody.

   In a number of Oceanic languages patterns of polysemy indicate a close association
between seeing and knowing. That vision is our primary source of objective data about the
world is supported by child-language studies and by cross-linguistic studies of evidentials
(Sweetser 1990:39). In Oceanic languages a seeing verb always refers to sight alone, never
including other senses. The association between seeing and knowing is illustrated in reflexes
of POc _*kita_ and _*re(k,q)i_ above and of POc _*qilo_ below. The latter has been tentatively
reconstructed as ‘be aware of, discern, see’. The most detailed evidence is from the Polynesian
glosses, and this indicates that ‘know, be aware, recognize, notice’ is the core meaning, with
‘see’ as an extension.

Gedaged (NNG) _il_ (V) ‘look at, behold, discern, perceive’; (N) ‘sight, view’ could reflect either
_*qilo_ or _*kita_, and we have no way of choosing between them.

    We have considered the possibility that _*qilo_ derives from POc _*liqos_ (see above) by
metathesis. Certainly the set of cognates supporting _*qilo_ is in near-complementary
distribution (according to subgroups) with those supporting _*liqos_. One could argue that
Nakanai _hilo_ is an independent development from the metathesis in Remote Oceanic
languages. However, the semantic range of reflexes of _*qilo_, especially in Polynesian, appears
to differ from _*liqos_ reflexes.

    A number of additional Polynesian forms are derived from POc _*qilo_. These forms are
cited because they throw further light on the semantic range of _*qilo_.

    Although POc verbs like _*kita_ ‘see’, _*kita-i-_ ‘see s.t.’ and POc _*liqo(s)_ (VI) ‘see, look’,
_*liqos-i-_ (VT) ‘see s.t., look at s.t.’ have both a transitive and intransitive form, their reflexes
tend to occur in utterances with a specific object. _*liqos-i-_ or one of the other reconstructed
‘look’ forms can be used to signal that the act is intentional or more tightly focused.

   It is rare for a seeing verb to be able to take either experiencer or stimulus as subject. We
have reconstructed a single verb, POc _*kila(t)_ (U-verb) ‘be seen clearly, discerned,
recognised’, (A-verb) ‘see clearly, discern, recognise’, where reflexes in Micronesia and
Polynesia show that the same verb may carry either interpretation. Elsewhere, we have located
examples where a seeing verb is used intransitively as a stative verb with source as subject
only in the Tongan and E Futunan reflexes of _*kita_ with meaning ‘appear, come into view’.
Evans (2003:68) concurs with respect to their rarity, but remains open as to whether
intransitive _*kita_ was (in Evans’ terms) Actor or Undergoer subject, or perhaps either. The
balance of the evidence favours Actor subject only.


8.3     Hearing

All languages in our sample have a transitive verb with ‘hear s.t.’ as one of its senses or its only
sense, though in a number of Eastern Oceanic languages this verb may be extended to
perceiving by non-visual senses. POc _*roŋoR-_ ‘hear s.t.’ is generally reconstructed. However,
there are certain problems associated with the formal reconstruction, to be discussed below.

    A substantial number of reflexes of _*roŋoR-_, distributed across different high-order
subgroups, carry the meaning ‘listen (to s.t. or s.o.)’, and it is likely that this sense was part of
its semantic range in POc. An intransitive form, POc _*roŋoR_ ‘hear’, is also reconstructable. In
just a few languages this form is reflected as a stative verb, ‘be heard’, with the sound or its
source as subject. We have located reflexes with the meaning ‘[be] heard’ only in Gela, the
Fijian languages and Tongan. This limited distribution suggests that the stative use has been
developed independently in Gela and the Central Pacific languages. (Evans 2003 points out
that in Philippine languages cognates show a similar uneven pattern of polysemy.)

    It is likely that when Proto Oceanic speakers wished to comment on the nature of a sound
they used the source as subject of a sound-specific verb, as the drum is sounding, the leaves
are rustling, their voices were audible etc. Perception is implied, but the lexemes are not
derived from verbs of perception. Oceanic speakers have a considerable vocabulary for the
names of particular sounds, typically using them as both noun and verb. One of the more
common ones is a reflex of POc *taŋis, an intransitive verb usually translated by ‘cry’, used to
describe any sound characteristic of its source, as a cock crowing, dog howling, drum beating
etc. In To’aba’ita, for instance, one could say _suʔari e aŋi ka ƒaluƒalu_ ‘the drum is
loud’ (_suʔari_ ‘drum’, _aŋi_ ‘to cry’, _ƒaluƒalu_ ‘sound loudly, of a drum’ (lit. ‘The drum is making
a sound and it is loud’.) Samoan uses a term for ‘voice’, _leo_ with verbal meaning ‘sound’ as in
_e leo taʔe_ ‘it sounds cracked’ (_taʔe_ ‘cracked’). The following is a random sample of sound
terms: Tolai _tin_ ‘sound, as a coconut falling to the ground’, _del_ ‘sound as the beating of a
drum’, _luluga_ (N,VI) ‘sound, as wind or rain’; To’aba’ita _ākwaʔa_ ‘make a slapping sound, as of
a flat object’, _ŋalu_ ‘of the sound of talking, be audible’, _kutakuta_ ‘make a relatively loud,
vibrating, pulsating sound’; Niuean _pakō_ ‘make a knocking sound’, _kalī_ ‘make a rustling
sound’, _pakē_ ‘make a light crackling sound’.

    Listening to something is sometimes given an extended cognitive meaning. In a number of
languages (Gedaged, Nakanai, Nehan, Sursurunga, Sa’a), ‘hear/listen’ has been extended to
‘understand’.[4] A different extension of meaning is noted in many Southeast Solomonic and
Central Pacific witnesses, where the meaning ‘obey, take notice of s.o.’ is present alongside
‘hear, listen’. In Lakon (NCV) _ruŋ_ means ‘hear, feel’, but also ‘obey’ and ‘know’ (Alexandre
François, pers. comm.). In Central Pacific languages this sense is usually associated with
reflexes of _*paka-roŋoR_, which contains the intensifying prefix _*paka-_.

    Certain difficulties arise in the reconstruction of the POc form(s) for ‘hear’. We concur
with Blust (ACD) who proposes POc _*roŋoR_, with initial _*r_, as the regular continuation of
PMP _*deŋeR_. This is supported by non-Oceanic, Eastern Oceanic and Schouten evidence.
_*loŋoR_ was a Western Oceanic variant, reflected in all WOc languages in which reflexes
occur, except in the Schouten languages (Wogeo, Kaiep, Kairuru, Ali, Sissano and Sera).

   Ross has hypothesised that the change in the final _*-R_ to _*-n_ and in the initial _*r-_ to _*l-_ was
dissimilatory: to avoid two different trills (_*R_ and _*r_) in the same very common word

    The next set, although theoretically supporting a putative POc _*noŋo(-noŋo)_, may simply
reflect a number of parallel changes to _*loŋoR_ or _*roŋoR_ in which different languages
independently assimilated initial _*l-_ or _*r-_ to the medial nasal.

8.4     Smelling

Verbs of smelling in Oceanic languages typically have an intransitive use, in which the source
of the smell is the subject, and a transitive use in which the perceiver is subject and the source is
direct object. Some examples follow.

   The reconstruction of POc _*s[a,o]ŋin_ (VSt) ‘emit a smell’, _*s[a,o]ŋin-_ (VT) ‘smell s.t.’ is
well supported if we accept that this form underwent sporadic changes in both the initial and
final vowel. From the range of glosses exhibited by reflexes, it seems likely that _*s[a,o]ŋin_
had both actor subject and source subject interpretations.

   A separate term for the action of deliberately sniffing at something, POc _*asok_[6] ‘to sniff,
kiss’ _*asok-i_ ‘sniff or kiss s.t.’, is reconstructable. This term continues a PAn etymon, _*Sajek_.

[6] Note the contrast of meaning with POc _*pVŋu_ (VI) ‘blow nose, sniff, snort’.

[7] Numfor, a South Halmahera-West New Guinea language, has a reflex of PMP _*hajek_: _yas_ ‘native
    manner of kissing by smelling the face’. This meaning is mirrored in an Oceanic cognate of _*hajek_ only
    in Rotuman, but illustrated also in Motu _harahu-a_ ‘to smell, kiss’, in the ’Are’are and Sa’a term _nono_
    ‘to kiss, place the face against, sniff’, in Mota _pupupun_ or _punpun_ ‘to snuff [sic] in the native way of
    kissing’ and in a number of reflexes of PPn _*soŋi_ ‘smell s.t, sniff s.t., greet s.o. by pressing nose to face
    or limb and sniffing’.

a chance resemblance, as PSV _*-e-_ does not regularly reflect POc _*-o-_.

    Tryon (1976) lists a number of NCV languages which denote ‘smell s.t.’ by compounding
reflexes of _*roŋoR_ ‘hear’ with reflexes of _*bona(s)_, to reflect PNCV _*roŋo-bona_, e.g. Raga
_roŋ-bunina_, Lametin _roŋ-bonai_.

    Our starting point for the cognate set below is a pair of PMP forms, _*bahu_ (V) ‘smell bad’,
reconstructed by Dempwolff, and _*bahu-an_ (N) ‘odour, stench’, reconstructed by Blust (ACD)
as a suffixed form of Dempwolff’s _*bahu_. Dempwolff glossed _*bahu_ as a noun, but it seems
likely that it was used as a verb, since _*bahu-an_ includes the nominaliser _*-an_. Blust
reconstructs _*bahu-an_ as Proto Western Malayo-Polynesian, but the Oceanic forms listed
below show that it occurred in PMP.[8]

    Most Malayo-Polynesian languages have lost _*h_, with the result that _*bahu_ and _*bahu-an_
respectively became _*baw_ and _*baw-an_. By regular sound change _*baw_ probably became
POc _*bo_, but _*baw-an_ may have survived in this form in POc alongside _*bo-an_ (see
discussion of Manam _bʷau_ below). POc _*bo_ is a phonotactically rare phenomenon, a
monosyllabic lexical root. There has long been a tendency in Austronesian languages to make
lexical forms disyllabic, and so _*bo_ occurs with a number of extensions, some of which we
cannot fully explain. Some of these extensions are disyllabic roots in their own right: see Bola
_bu-roŋi_, Bola (Harua) _bo-roŋi_, both ‘(s.o.) smell s.t.’ under POc _*s[a,o]ŋin_ ‘emit a smell’
above, and the Woleaian and Carolinian examples below. In Central Pacific and Micronesian
languages a monosyllabic lexical root becomes bimoraic, i.e. its vowel is long.

    The POc noun _*bo[-]_ is shown below with a bracketed hyphen, as a number of its reflexes
are monovalent nouns. Monovalent reflexes in Ponapean and Puluwatese suggest that the POc
monovalent form was sometimes _*boe-_, and it is perhaps this form that is also reflected by
Kiribati _pʷoi_ (zero-valency noun) and Bauan _boi_ (intransitive verb).

[8] Thanks are particularly due to Malcolm Ross for making a detailed analysis of these two forms. The
    following paragraphs are based substantially on his comments.

    Among the reflexes of POc _*bo-an_ below Manam _bʷau_ requires particular comment. At
first sight it looks as if it reflects a POc _*baw_, i.e. a form in which earlier _*-aw_ has not become
POc _*-o_. It is rather more likely, however, that it reflects POc _*baw-an_, with regular loss of
final _*-n_ and consequent irregular loss of _*-a_, since earlier word-internal _*-aw-_ did not always
become POc _*-o-_. Gumawana _bowana_ is the only form below which attests to the presence of
POc final _*-n_. Note that the Gumawana and Gapapaiwa forms both serve as verbs as well as
nouns.

    Blust (1988) has reconstructed a family of PAn ‘stench’ words which all contain the
phonemic sequence _*qaŋe-_ (_*qaŋeSit_ ‘stench, musky odor of an animal’, _*qaŋeliC_ ‘stench of
burning substances’, _*qaŋeRiS_ ‘stench of fish’, _*qaŋeRu_ ‘stench of spoiled or souring organic
matter’ and _*qaŋeseR_ ‘stench of urine’). The only clear trace of these in Oceanic languages is
in the Gela term: _aŋo_ ‘emit a sour smell, as of urine’.

    Oceanic languages often have terms for the smell of urine and other body secretions, and
terms for various other odours, good and bad. Milner’s Samoan dictionary, for instance, lists
_soŋo_ (V) ‘smell of urine etc.’, _lalaʔoa_ (V) ‘smell of fish’, _sauŋa_ (N,V) ‘smell of stale food etc.’,
_ʔalalā_ (N,V) ‘smell of meat or fish when cooked’, _elo_ (V, ADJ) ‘give an offensive smell of
decomposing flesh’. However, few terms for specific odours have been collected from other
languages and we have been unable to make reconstructions other than the one above and the

    Familiar smells may be lexicalised, either as a stative verb or noun, e.g. _*(q)aŋo(R)_ ‘smell,
as of urine’ (from PAn _*qaŋeSeR_ ‘stench of urine’), _*soŋo_ ‘[be] acrid, pungent, as smell of
urine’ (from PMP _*seŋet_ ‘acrid, pungent, of odor’), and _*masi(t)_ ‘smell bad; [be] sour, acid,
fermented’ (from PMP _*maŋsit_ ‘vile smell’). Although these three POc reconstructions have
here been given a verbal form, it is evident that in two cases the PAn or PMP antecedents are
nouns and in the third, many of the lower level reflexes are also nouns. It is noteworthy that in
all the cognate sets supporting verbal ‘smell’ reconstructions there are examples of the verb
functioning also as a noun. This tendency has not been noted in any of the other sense-related
verbs other than in the terms given to specific sounds. We have reconstructed one generic
noun, POc _*bo[-]_ ‘odour, scent’ which can also be used as a stative verb, meaning ‘have an
odour’.

8.5      Tasting

Taste is the sense that informs us about what we are eating or drinking. Perception of taste is
usually the outcome of an intentional act. POc _*ñami-_ (VT) ‘taste s.t., test the flavour of food’ is
well attested, with reflexes scattered across diverse subgroups. Reflexes of a partially
reduplicated form, _*ña-ñami_, also occur in some languages as a stative verb, meaning ‘be tasty,
taste good’. The attribution of this sense to POc is somewhat strengthened by extra-Oceanic
cognates. A fully reduplicated form, _*ñami-ñami_ is also reflected in Ramoaaina (MM), Gela
and Longgu (SES), Marshallese (Mic) and Rennellese (Pn), and this may have been an
intransitive verb meaning ‘to taste, do tasting’.

    _*ña-ñami_ has a PMP antecedent in the form of PMP _*ñamñam_ ‘taste, tasty’ which Blust
(1989) reconstructs on the basis of Tagalog _namnam_ ‘savor, taste; palatal sensation’ and Selaru
_nanam_ ‘sweet’ together with Oceanic reflexes. POc _*ñami_ appears to continue the PMP root
_*ñam_ with the addition of the transitive sufix _*-i_.[9]

    Except for Tikopia, which has doublets _nami_ ‘taste’ and _namu_ ‘odour, bad smell’, the
Central Pacific reflexes of _*ñami_ show a vowel change _*i_ > _u_. Polynesian reflexes tend to blur
the distinction between taste and smell, both senses contributing to the assessment of quality
of food. The shift from flavour to odour is complete in Pukapukan, Rennellese and Samoan.

[9] There are many parallel cases of PMP disyllables of the form R-R (where R is a monosyllabic root)
    being continued in Oceanic as R-_i_ (Blust 1977, Ross 1998c:24-25).

                                                                                    Perception 511

There is a formal similarity between _*ñami_ and the next two reconstructions, _*tami_ and
_*mamis_, together with _*(d,dr)amʷi_ ‘lick’ (§4.3.5.2). They may ultimately share descent from a
PAn monosyllabic root, _*mis_ (Blust 1988).

    It is possible that POc _*mamis_ ‘sweet’ has evolved by a different route from POc _*mamis_
‘try by tasting’. Whereas the former is derived directly from PAn and PMP etyma, the latter
may be the product of contamination between POc _*mamis_ ‘sweet’ and POc _*ñami_ ‘to taste
s.t.’.

    Some Oceanic languages lack a verb dedicated to the meaning of intentional tasting.
Instead, they use a verb whose basic meaning is more general, such as reflexes of POc _*topoŋ-i_
‘try/attempt s.t.’ or ‘sample s.t.’, or terms for ‘nibble’ or ‘lick’. To limit such a verb to the
tasting of food or drink a qualifier is added. Thus in Seimat one says _ŋa ani tohoŋi-wa_ ‘I taste
the food’ (_ani_ ‘eat’, _tohoŋi_ (VT) ‘try, attempt s.t.’) and in Tolai _an-tamai_ (VT) ‘to taste, of
food’ (_an_ ‘eat’, _tamai_ ‘taste, try’). Kwaio has _ʔana toʔona_ (_ʔani_ ‘eat’, _toʔona_ ‘put to the test’)
and _mea toʔona_ (_mea_ ‘tongue’, _toʔona_ ‘put to the test’), both meaning ‘taste (food)’, while
To’aba’ita has _qani-toʔona_ ‘taste s.t. by eating it, try the taste of s.t.’ (_qania_ ‘eat’, _toʔona_ ‘test,
check’) and _kuqu-toʔona_ ‘drink s.t. to see what it is like’ (_kuqu_ ‘drink’).

[10] Compare Motu _daua-toho_ ‘to feel a thing’ (_dau-_ ‘stretch out the arm’, _toho_ ‘try’)

                                                                                         Perception 513


    A speaker of POc could pass judgement on the taste of something in the mouth by using an
adjectival verb, with the source of the flavour as subject. The following verbs are specifically
taste descriptors: _*mamis_ ‘[be] sweet, _*ña-ñami_ ‘[be] tasty, taste good’ and _*maqasin_ ‘[be]
salty’ (Ross et al., 2003:68). A PPn verb _*suqa_ (VI) ‘have a certain taste or flavour’ is
reconstructable, occurring in the compound _*suqa-malie_ ‘taste good; sweet, delicious’.
Another strategy is to use a compound of the form V + modifier, where V is a verb meaning
‘eat’ or ‘drink’, e.g. Wayan Fijian _kani vinā_ ‘be tasty (lit. ‘eat well’), _kani ðakaðā_ ‘taste
bad’ (‘eat bad’).

    While smelling terms are frequently nouns, taste terms are predominantly verbs. The only
examples in our cognate sets where reflexes of a reconstructed verb are used as a noun are in
Niuean and Tikopia reflexes of POc _*ñami-_ (VT) ‘to taste s.t.’, and in each case the term has
changed its meaning from taste to smell.


8.5         Perceiving by touch

The sense often labelled ‘touch’ has to do with perceiving pressure on the skin. Awareness of
such pressure is expressed in English by the verb ‘feel’, e.g. ‘I can feel the wind in my face’.
More commonly the reference is to contact between skin, usually hand, and a solid object,
resulting in awareness of some property of the latter’s surface. ‘Feel’ is also used in English to
denote awareness of a physiological or emotional condition, e.g. ‘feel sick or frightened or
responsible’. We will not be concerned here with the latter sense of ‘feel’.

    POc _*si(g,k)il_ ‘touch with the fingers’ is our strongest candidate for a verb meaning
‘perceive by touch’. Reflexes of POc _*taŋo(p)_ ‘take hold of, grasp, touch with the hand’ tend
to carry the additional meaning of deliberately taking hold or grasping. In some languages
reflexes of a PWOc term _*sau_ ‘reach out with hand, touch’ may be combined with a verb
meaning ‘try’ to express that meaning, as in the Motu and Nakanai examples below, but we
cannot reconstruct a specific compound verb for PWOc meaning ‘perceive by touch’. Other
Oceanic languages use verbs that are either primarily verbs of manipulation (do s.t. by hand,
grope, grasp, poke, stroke etc.) or of making contact in a physical sense, without involving
awareness (be in contact, reach), although some may have had ‘perceive by touch’ as a
secondary sense.

particular sense, namely: _*kita-_ ‘see s.t.’, _*roŋo-_ ‘hear s.t.’, _*sa[a,o]ŋin-_ ‘smell s.t.’, _*ñami-_
‘taste s.t.’ and _*si(g,k)il-i-_ ‘touch with the fingers’. Certain of these verbs were polysemous but
each had a canonical use in which the grammatical subject is the experiencer of an act of
perception and the direct object is the stimulus.

    Three of the above reconstructions, _*roŋo-_, _*sa[a,o]ŋin-_ and _*ñami-_ are reconstructable
with both ‘sensing’ and ‘attending’ senses, that is both with and without intention. Reflexes of
_*si(g,k)il-i_ are apparently typically used with an intentional force. In order to express the
meaning ‘listen’ a number of languages (Southeast Solomonic, Fijian, Polynesian) add an
intensifying prefix to _*roŋo_, providing some evidence for PEOc _*paka-roŋo(R,n)-_ ‘listen to
s.t.’. This kind of semantic extension was probably not characteristic of _*kita-_ ‘see s.t.’. To
denote intentional acts of visual perception POc speakers, like English speakers, could choose
from a range of different transitive and intransitive verbs meaning, e.g. ‘look (at s.t.)’,
‘glance’, ‘look intently or closely’, ‘peer (at s.t.)’ and ‘look for s.t.’. There are many more
verbs denoting kinds of visual activities than there are verbs denoting kinds of hearing,
smelling, tasting and sensing by touch, and many of the former involve intent.

    With regard to meanings where the stimulus or source is subject, POc perception verbs
vary in their ability to occur as stative verbs. With verbs of seeing and hearing, stimulus-
subject verbs are very rare in daughter languages. A single reconstruction, POc _*kilat_ (U-verb)
‘be seen clearly, discerned, recognised’, (A-verb) ‘see clearly, discern, recognise’, has been
made. Languages tend instead to use verbs unrelated to the transitive forms to represent
meanings like ‘be visible/be seen/appear, be audible/be heard/sound’. When the focus is on the
outcome of hearing, languages generally have a range of stative verbs comparable to ‘be
noisy, be loud’. We have collected a number of such terms but have made no reconstructions.
Languages tend also to have many terms for specific sounds which can be used as stative
verbs with source as subject. In such cases the act of perception is implied. A number of these
verbs also act as nouns, a feature shared with those smell verbs that refer to specific odours.

516 Meredith Osmond and Andrew Pawley


    In the case of smelling and tasting, however, stative verbs derived from actor-subject verbs
are common in Oceanic languages and several such pairs have been reconstructed for POc,
e.g. _*s[a,o]ŋin_ (VSt) ‘emit a smell’ (alongside _*s[a,o]ŋin-_ (VT) ‘smell s.t.’), POc _*quruŋ_ (VSt)
‘emit a smell’ (alongside _*quruŋ-i_ (VT) ‘to smell s.t.’) and POc _*ña-ñami_ (VI) ‘[be] tasty, taste
good’ (alongside _*ñami-_ (VT) ‘to taste s.t.’). For verbs of smelling and tasting it is also possible
to reconstruct stative verbs that refer to qualities specific to one sense, as POc _*soŋo_ ‘be acrid,
pungent’, POc _*masi(t)_ ‘smell bad; [be] sour, acid, fermented’ _*mamis_ ‘[be] sweet, _*ña-ñami_
‘[be] tasty, taste good’ and _*maqasin_ ‘[be] salty’, although only _*ña-ñami_ is derived from an
experiencer-subject verb. The others can be attached to appropriate nouns without the need for
a verb of sensing.

    The variations in the linguistic expression of the different senses that we find in Oceanic
languages are grounded, at least in part, in the nature of the senses themselves. Each human
sense operates under certain conditions that influence the way it is expressed. See and hear
have a degree of commonality in that the experiencer must channel his or her focus on one
aspect singled out from the many possible sights or sounds present. For Proto Oceanic, this
focus is represented by the object of a transitive verb. In contrast, for smell and taste the
sensation is likely to be the only one of that kind available to the experiencer at that moment.
As with feel, it is likely that we know already what we are focusing on, particularly if we are
in contact with the object perceived. So in Proto Oceanic it is more usual with smell and taste
for the source to be the subject of an intransitive verb, if necessary with a qualifier.

    Mention was made earlier of the possibility of a universal hierarchy within which the
senses are ordered, which will predict the direction of semantic change. Viberg (1984) finds
some evidence for the hierarchy sight > hearing > touch > smell, taste. Comparison of a large
sample of Oceanic languages shows that most verbs of sensing have remained dedicated to a
single sense. For most people, sight is the primary source of objective data about the world,
and evidently was treated as such by Proto Oceanic speakers. We have no examples from a
sample of many dozens of languages where a verb meaning ‘see’ has extended its meaning to
other senses, although it can carry a cognitive meaning like ‘know’ or ‘recognise’.

    In contrast, _*roŋoR_ ‘hear’ is the most semantically elastic of the sense terms. In some
languages of the Solomons, Vanuatu and Polynesia, reflexes, still with the primary meaning
‘hear’, can be extended to ‘smell’, ‘taste’ and ‘feel’, although never to ‘see’. In the (admittedly
very small) sample of eight languages in Table 21 (two from Southeast Solomonic, two from
North Central Vanuatu and four from Polynesia) it can be seen that, besides hearing, the
bundles of senses included are hearing, smell and taste (4), hearing and touch (2) and hearing
and taste (1). There are no cases where touch is grouped together with smell and taste while
excluding hearing. Thus, if the descriptions are accurate, it is noteworthy that the pattern of
semantic extensions does not correspond exactly to Viberg’s hierarchy in that see remains
outside the hierarchy, while in several languages smell and taste outrank touch.

    Reflexes of POc _*ñami-_, PPn _*namu_ ‘to taste s.t.’, have evidently undergone a shift in
meaning in a number of Polynesian languages. Some reflexes now refer to odour as well as
flavour, and the shift is complete in Pukapukan, Rennellese, Samoan and Tikopia, where
reflexes refer to odour alone. In view of this example it is possible that taste should precede
smell in the hierarchy, although Viberg brackets the two together.

   A number of commentators have proposed that, when it comes to extending sensory verbs
to refer to cognitive processes, humans are visual-centric. That is, verbs of cognition, like
‘know’, ‘think’ and ‘understand’, tend to be recruited from verbs of seeing. However,
Evans and Wilkins (2000:549) write that

__blockquote__
     in Australian languages it is hearing, not vision, that regularly extends into the cognitive
     domain, going beyond the expected extension of ‘hear’ to ‘understand’ and on to ‘know’ …
     and other cognitive verbs.

   This contrasts with the Indo-European based pattern described by Sweetser (1990) in
which vision is the precursor of knowing. Reflexes of POc verbs _*kita_ and _*re(k,q)i_ ‘see’ and
_*qilo_ ‘be aware of, discern, see’, indicate that, as in the Indo-European pattern, ‘know’ is more
closely affiliated with ‘see’ than ‘hear’. On the other hand, we have examples where
‘understand’ is an extension of both ‘see’ and ‘hear’. We do not have a large enough sample to
draw a conclusion. It may be that context permits either.

   Evans and Wilkins (2000:567) also describe the extension of meaning from ‘hear’ to ‘obey’
as common in Australian languages. We have examples of the same link from ‘hear’ to ‘listen’
to ‘obey’ across a number of subgroups (Southeast Solomonic, Micronesian, North and
Central Vanuatu, Fijian, Polynesian). Sweetser (1990:42) writes that it is widely attested in
Indo-European languages and suggests that the link may well be universal.



9                Body part metaphors

9.1      Introduction[1]

It is part of the human condition that people speak of what is happening in their minds by
equating it with something familiar in the physical world. Although emotions are cognitive
appraisals they are felt physically, and languages the world over tend to express them through
body part metaphors. Body part metaphors (BPMs) can also serve as a useful way of
expressing non-emotional cognitive states or processes such as believing, remembering,
agreeing, etc. and of referring to temperamental qualities such as timid or lazy. They are widely
used in the Oceanic-speaking world, as chapters 10 and 11 show.

    The following are examples from a range of Oceanic languages.[2]

__formgroup__
    Adm: Seimat                |patu ailan       | [head hard/strong] ‘he is obstinate’
    NNG: Bukawa                |titaʔ gi-wing ai | [belly.his it-accompany me] ‘he loves me’
    PT:  Kiriwina              |i-tutu vovo-gu   | [it-hammer body-my] ‘I am excited’
    MM: Nakanai                |la hate-la mamasi| [the liver-his salty] ‘he is angry’
    SES: ’Are’are              |rae hitari-a     | [liver strikes-it] ‘understand’
    NCV: Mota                   lolo-bʷoŋ          [insides-darkness] ‘be ignorant, forget’
    Mic: Ifaluk [3]             |ye tewasi sexa-i | [this be.torn belly-my] ‘I am grief-stricken’

    Particular feelings are expressed as a body part + a predicate, either verb, adjective or noun,
specifying the nature of the feeling. The body part is inalienably possessed (§3.1.1). The BPM
usually takes one of two syntactic shapes. In the first construction, the body part is subject of
the clause and the modifying expression is the predicate. In the second, a compound is formed
(e.g. Mota _lolo-bʷoŋ_ above) which is then used as a predicate, and the affected person is
typically the subject. Klamer (2001) finds both constructions in Central Malayo-Polynesian
languages of eastern Indonesia, and it is reasonable to infer that they both occurred in Proto
Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, the shared ancestor of these languages and Oceanic, and
were continued into POc.

    Less often, the body part is object of a verb (e.g. ’Are’are _rae hitari-a_ above). For purposes
of comparison these expressions are generally given here in the way in which they are often
included in wordlists, i.e. without grammatical elements.

[1] Particular thanks are due to Malcolm Ross for advice during preparation of this chapter. I have also
    benefitted from discussions with Paul Geraghty, Alan Jones and Ralph Lawton.

[2] Glosses given in square brackets are morpheme-by-morpheme glosses.

[3] Ifaluk is a Micronesian atoll whose speakers are closely related to those of Woleai. Its emotional domain
    has been described in detail by Lutz (1988).

520 Meredith Osmond

    In the examples of complex lexemes in this chapter and the following chapters, the same
conventions are used as elsewhere. A monovalent (directly possessed) noun is shown with a
final hyphen. Thus Takia _ilo-_ ‘insides’ represents _ilo-g_ ‘my insides’, _ilo-n_ ‘her/his/its insides’
etc. In a few languages, e.g. Wayan Fijian, the possessor is marked by a prefix rather than a
suffix, and the hyphen is thus initial rather than final. A transitive verb is also often shown with
a final hyphen, indicating an object suffix, and verbs generally are sometimes shown with an
initial hyphen, indicating a subject prefix. As a result, in a BPM a space between words is
sometimes crucial. Thus in To’aba’ita _manata- ruarua_ ‘be undecided, of two minds’ is a BPM in
which _manata-_ ‘mind’ + possessor suffix is the subject and _ruarua_ ‘be two’ is the predicate, while
_manata-ruarua_ with the same meaning is a compound predicate.

    The question to be explored here is whether expressions of this kind can be reconstructed
for POc, and, if they can, what body-part nouns are implicated in these reconstructions.
Reconstructions for specific terms for cognitive states, emotions and character attributes are
found in chapters 10 and 11.

    BPMs are one pattern for forming complex (polymorphemic) lexemes in Oceanic
languages. Another widespread pattern is the serial verb construction.


9.2     Implicated body parts: POc _*qate-_ and _*lalom_

Speakers of Oceanic languages typically identify emotions, temperamental qualities and some
cognitive processes as emanating from either their liver, POc _*qate-_ (§3.7.6), or a quasi-body
part, POc _*lalo-_/_lalom_ (vol.2:237), here translated as ‘insides’ or ‘mind’, although other body
parts may be represented. Both are reconstructable at least as far back as PMP with both a
literal and a metaphorical meaning.

522 Meredith Osmond


    It is worth noting here that while _*qate-_ emotion BPMs are numerous in Western Oceanic
languages and Sa’a, and to a lesser degree in ’Are’are and Kwaio, they are scarce elsewhere.
Motu, Marshallese and Bauan and Wayan Fijian reserve ‘liver’ for use in expressions of
bravery and cowardice. François (2013:204) notes that reflexes of Proto Torres-Banks _*vara_
‘liver’ are only used in daughter languages in expressions of awe and fear.[4] Although the liver
is recorded as linked to emotion in four Polynesian languages, Rennellese, Tikopia, Maori and
Hawaiian, compound terms containing a reflex of _*qate-_ have been found only in Rennellese
(_kai ʔate_ [eat liver] ‘talk badly about others, gossip’ and _hekaiʔki oku ʔate_ [eat of one’s own
liver] ‘be very angry’). Firth (1985) records that in Tikopia _ate_ occurred only in ancient speech
involving traumatic situations.

    A number of languages have replaced their term for ‘liver’ in emotion and cognition BPMs
with one for ‘belly’ or ‘heart’, terms that for our purposes here are regarded as equivalent. A
Huon Gulf language, Yabem, uses _tɪtaʔ_ ‘belly, bowels, stomach’ from _tɪ_ ‘liver, lung’+ _taʔ_
‘excrement’, in its body part metaphors. While the Arosi dictionary glosses _sae_ (from _*qate-_)
as ‘mind, heart, thought; only in phrases’, many relevant terms are instead compounded with
_ahu_ ‘belly, heart, mind, feelings’. Although Kwaio uses _lae ~ sae_ for some emotions (_lae-fou_
‘brave, unashamed’, _lae-nia_ ‘desire, like, love’), it uses _oga_ ‘belly, mind’ for angry-type terms
(_oga-lia_ ‘be angry, sorry’). To’aba’ita uses _rake_ ‘belly’ for expressions of anger, courage and
fear. Lau also uses _rake_ ‘stomach; heart, mind, seat of affections’ for expressions of anger:
_rake aŋoaŋo_ [belly hot] ‘be angry’, _rake ʔiri_ [belly cut] ‘be violent, angry’, but extends it to
other feelings: _rake diana_ [belly good] ‘to be kind and generous’, _rake moumoula_ [belly
afraid] ‘timid, afraid’, _rake sasu_ [belly smoking] ‘sulky’, _rake fanefane_ [belly excited]
‘impetuous, in a hurry’. Other languages may equate ‘heart’ in this sense with ‘liver’ in some
contexts. Two closely related North Coast languages Gedaged and Takia, apparently extend
the meaning of _bube-_, a term for liver, to refer also to the heart as the seat of emotion.


9.2.2 POc _*lalom_

The second term, POc _*lalo-_, _*lalom_, glossed ‘inside’ in volume 2 (p237), also occurs widely
with the additional meaning ‘mind, seat of thoughts and emotions’. The form _*lalo-_ is the
directly possessed (monovalent; §§3.1.1–2) form of the zero-valency noun _*lalom_, and the
latter is henceforth used in the text as a proxy for both forms. Dictionary glosses of reflexes of
_*lalom_ refer to ‘mind’ in languages of North New Guinea, Papuan Tip, Southeast Solomonic,
both North/Central and South Vanuatu, Micronesia and Fijian, and there are frequent examples
of both emotional and non-emotional cognitive states in the metaphors collected.

[4]  The Codrington-Palmer Dictionary of Mota notes that men ate the _varai_ ‘liver’ of a corpse in order to get
     _mana_ for courage and strength.

                                                                        Body part metaphors 525


   It is worth noting from the above that few BPMs have been located from Meso-Melanesian
languages and none from the Southeast Solomons. Gaps in the former may be due simply to
lack of data, while in the latter, terms other than _*lalom_ reflexes are now used. Although Arosi
has a reflex of _*lalom_, its role in BPMs of emotion is filled by _ahu_ or _hau_ both forms glossed
‘belly, mind, feelings, particularly in compounds’.


9.3      Terms implicating other body parts

As well as varying their term for ‘liver’ by employing a broadly equivalent term such as ‘belly’
or ‘heart’, as in Yabem, Gedaged, Takia, Kwaio, Lau, Arosi and To’aba’ita and no doubt others,
languages may also use other body part terms, particularly those for ‘mouth/voice’ and ‘face’,
as these body parts play a significant role in expressing feeling. Takia (NNG) speakers, for
instance, use _awa-_ ‘mouth, voice’ (from POc _*qawa_ ‘mouth, opening’; §3.4.12.3) in BPMs
meaning ‘agree’, ‘obey’ (follow s.o.’s mouth), ‘believe’, ‘accuse’, ‘promise’ and ‘answer’.

    In Takia (Ross, pers. comm.) although the majority of terms to do with the emotions and
the mind come from _ilo-_ (from POc _*lalo-_), smaller roles are played by _bube-_ ‘liver’ (replacing
_ate-_), _awa-_ ‘mouth, voice’ and _nao-_ ‘face’ (from POc _*nako-_; §3.4.7).

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia         |ilo- wei        |    [insides- many] ‘be in doubt’
  NNG: Takia         |ilo- murua-     |    [insides- heavy-it] ‘be sad’
  NNG: Takia         |bube- yai i-nani|    [liver fire it-cook] ‘very angry’
  NNG: Takia         |bube- sakar     |    [liver hard/firm/strong] ‘hard-hearted, stubborn’
  NNG: Takia         |awa- i-loŋ      |    [mouth it-follow] ‘obey, believe’
  NNG: Takia         |awa-uraru       |    [mouth-two]‘two-faced, hypocritical’
  NNG: Takia         |nao- i-didi     |    [face- it-swell] ‘be stony-faced, impassive’

   In Kiriwina (PT; Lawton n.d.b), BPMs that refer to a person’s feelings and inner states may
come from the body (_vovo-_, from PWOc _*popo-_ ‘the complete skin’; §3.2.1), mind (_nano-_[6]),
belly (_lopo-_), head (_daba-_) and eye (_mata-_, from POc _*mata-_; §3.4.9.1). Thus:

__formgroup__
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-tutu vovo-gu    |  [it-hammers body-my] ‘I am excited’
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-kubukubu nano-gu|  [it-quivers mind-my] ‘I am astonished’
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-yowa lopo-la    |  [it-flew belly-his] ‘He leapt in surprise’
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-kapisi lopo-la  |  [it-feels pity belly-her] ‘She is sorry/mourns/feels pity’
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-minimani daba-la|  [it-tough/strong head-his] ‘he is stubborn’
    PT: Kiriwina          |i-gibu mati-la    |  [it-passive eye-his] ‘he sulks, is sullen’

Lawton lists numerous examples of near synonyms where only the body part is varied (e.g.
_i‑mama mati-la_ [it-weary eye-his] vs _i-mama nona_ [it-weary mind] and others where different
contexts are appropriate (_iluva nona_ [body happy through shared food] vs _i-bʷaina nona_ [it-
good mind] vs _i-mʷasila nona_ [it-shy mind], all three loosely translated by ‘happy’. Many such
metaphors are capable of varying interpretations and may require context of situation to be
fully understood. By such means, Kiriwina speakers have hundreds of ways in which they can
express mental states.

    The adoption of other body part terms has evolved in various ways in daughter languages,
muddying further a straightforward division between _*qate-_ and _*lalom_ BPMs. In Papuan Tip
and Southeast Solomonic languages, specific terms for ‘mind’ serve as the base term for
mental states. A number of Papuan Tip languages have largely replaced _*lalo-_ reflexes with
reflexes of PPT _*nua-_, reflecting POc _*nuka-_ ‘mind, thought’ (§10.3), in labelling their
mental states while retaining their _*qate-_ reflexes.

__formgroup__
    PT: Dobu              |nua-yai      |       [mind/insides-hold.firmly] ‘remember’
    PT: Dobu              |ʔate pisali  |       [liver explode] ‘very angry’
    PT: Kukuya            |nua vi-avini |       [mind/insides it-hold] ‘remember s.o., s.t.’
    PT: Kukuya            |nua-pania    |       [mind/insides-harden] ‘forget s.t.’
    PT: Bwaidoga          |nuwa aboda-na|       [mind/insides untidy/uncleared-it] ‘closed mind’
    PT: Bwaidoga          |ase kolukolu |       [liver plucked] ‘alarm, terror’
    PT: Bwaidoga          |ate-vatu     |       [liver-strong] ‘being unmoved, bold, brave’

The two reflexes in combination may have originally meant feeling something ‘inside the
liver’:

__formgroup__
    PT: Dobu         ʔate-nua-ʔoleʔole [liver-inside-pity] ‘compassion’
    PT: Kukuya       ate-nuanuai       [liver-inside-at] ‘have compassion, sympathy’

    Some Malaitan languages of the southeast Solomons, (Lau, Kwaio and To’aba’ita) use
reflexes of POc _*manaca(m)_ ‘think, understand, think about…’ (§10.3), glossed below as
‘mind’ as a base term for temperamental qualities and cognitive states. (Gela has _manaha_ ‘to
know, understand, appreciate’, but no compounds are listed.) ’Are’are speakers use it rather to
describe behaviour.

[6] Although Kiriwina _nano-_ ‘mind’ is not the expected reflex of POc _*lalo-_ ‘inside’, it may have been
    borrowed from a regular reflex of _*lalo-_ in another PT language in which _*l_ > _n_.

                                                                             Body part metaphors 527

    SES: ’Are’are            |manata ori     |     [behaviour returned/changed] ‘correct oneself’

    The term for mouth/voice seems to have evolved into voice/throat independently in
different places, occurring in non-cognate form as a base term in Mapos Buang (NNG), some
southeast Solomonic languages (Gela, Bugotu, Lau and To’aba’ita), the Vanikoro languages of
Temotu, and Marshallese. This may have evolved from the belief that the mind resides in the
throat or larynx, as described by Malinowski for Kiriwina.

    Malinowski, describing Trobriand Island magic, writes:

__blockquote__
       The mind, _nanola_, by which term intelligence, power of discrimination, capacity for
       learning magical formulae and all forms of non-manual skill are described, as well as moral
       qualities, resides somewhere in the larynx. The natives will always point to the organs of
       speech, where the _nanola_ resides. … The memory, however, the store of formulae and
       traditions, learned by heart, resides deeper, in the belly. A man will be said to have a good
       _nanola_ when he can acquire many formulae, but though they enter through the larynx,
       naturally, as he learns them, repeating word for word, he has to stow them away in a bigger
       and more commodious receptacle; they sink right down to the bottom of his abdomen.
       (1922:408-409)

   Senft, whose Trobriand fieldwork was carried out some seventy years after Malinowski,
records a similar belief. His informant explained what happens when he whispers his magic
formulae. As Senft translates it, “If I whisper magic, the magic(al formula) will go from the
belly to my larynx and then I whisper magic. I speak (the) magic(al formula).” (1998:89). The
larynx is thus recognised as the active agent or vehicle of the brain and mind.

   That this belief is widespread is demonstrated by the following phrases recorded by
Firth (1985) in his Tikopia dictionary:

__block__
       _te maanatu e fai i te manava, ki te atami_ ‘memory is produced in the belly by the mind’
       _te atami te taŋata ena i na manava, fenatu ki na ŋutu, muna rei_ ‘the thoughts of a person are there in his belly, come up to his mouth, and he speaks’

while a Woleaian term from Sohn & Tawerilmang’s (1976) dictionary reinforces the same idea:

__blockquote__
       _segali_   (VT) ‘remember it (in his stomach instead of his mind)’.[7]

[7] In our orthography _sexari_.

528 Meredith Osmond

   Mapos Buang (NNG) has a term _kʷa-_, defined by Rambok & Hooley (2010) as ‘neck,
throat; mind, will; idea, thought’, and reflecting POc _*kʷa_ ‘say’. which occurs as a base in
BPMs for emotions, including _kʷa-paya_ ‘miserable, unhappy, sad’, _kʷa-pesivin_ ‘sorry for/
compassionate’ and _kʷa-ketuin_ ‘sorry, sad, depressed, miserable’ as well as for a number of
temperamental qualities—_kʷa-srɛsk_ ‘cunning’, _kʷa-veroq_ ‘carefree’, _kʷa-tupin_ ‘quick-witted’—
and cognitive states (_kʷa luu_ ‘doubtful’, _kʷa-seyohek_ ‘confused’, _kʷa-virek(in)_ ‘forget’.

   The term for ‘throat’, found as a basis for emotion and cognition BPMs in Gela, Bugotu,
Lau and To’aba’ita, reflects POc _*liqoR_ ‘neck, voice’. In Gela it appears to have become the
generic base for all emotions while in Lau and To’aba’ita it may have referred to actual voice
quality. It may also be simply a literal description of a physical state as in the Lau expression
for ‘thirsty’, literally ‘dry throat’.

__formgroup__
  SES: Gela             |lio padi  |          [voice lacking] ‘confused, puzzled; ashamed’
  SES: Gela             |lio dika  |          [voice bad] ‘sad, sorry’
  SES: Gela             |lio papara|          [hot voice] ‘keen, zealous’
  SES: Gela             |lio patu  |          [voice hard] ‘daring, brave’

  SES: To’aba’ita       |lio toqo  |          [voice learned/informed] ‘be knowledgeable, talented, gifted, wise’

   The Vanikoro languages in the Temotu group also treat the neck or throat as the seat of
emotions and feelings. Although terms for ‘throat’ are not cognate in the three languages
quoted, semantic collocations are identical and morphosyntactic constructions largely
correspond:

__formgroup__
  TM: Vano             |warene gamitu i-tu|  [throat we it-blocked] ‘we are sorry/sad’
  TM: Tanema           |vasare gamuto i-to|  [throat we it-blocked] ‘we are sorry/sad’
  TM: Teanu            |awa kupa i-su     |  [throat we it-blocked] ‘we are sorry/sad’
  TM: Teanu            |awa ene i-aka     |  [throat I it-blow] ‘I am angry’ (François 2009:120)

     Marshallese, apparently alone among Micronesian languages, also uses ‘throat’ (_bōro_) as
a base for temperamental qualities:

__formgroup__
  Mic: Marshallese      |bōro jepel |         [throat diverging/separate] ‘disagree, non-cooperative’
  Mic: Marshallese      |bōro kadu  |         [throat short] ‘short-tempered’
  Mic: Marshallese      |bōro pejpej|         [throat shallow] ‘fickle, unstable’
  Mic: Marshallese      |bōro lap   |         [throat big] ‘wasteful, spendthrift’

   François (2013:204) notes that Torres-Banks languages occasionally describe certain
feelings using other body parts – such as the diaphragm (Proto Torres-Banks _*mʷala_) for
surprise; the belly (_*toᵐbʷa_, from POc _*tobʷa-_ ‘belly, stomach’; §3.7.4) for desire; the liver
(_*vara_) for awe and fear, while the head (_*bʷatu_, from POc _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’; §3.4.2.2) refers
to mind, intelligence: Mwotlap _ni-bʷti na-wak_ ‘your head is open’ , i.e. ‘you’re open-minded,
you have a curious mind’.

   In Proto Polynesian, POc _*lalom_ shifted its primary sense to ‘under’. Its place was taken
by PPn _*loto_, both in the sense of ‘inside’ and, used with a modifying element, ‘a particular
kind of feeling, desire or disposition’.

  Pn:     Hawaiian            |loko ʔino|             ‘merciless, cruel’ (_ʔino_ ‘wicked, immoral, sinful’)

   As Gerber explains it in her exploration of Samoan emotion,

__blockquote__
     The _loto_ can perhaps best be described as a quasi-organ. When asked where their _loto_ is,
     Samoans nearly always indicate their chests; in fact they are inclined to translate the word in
     English as ‘heart’. They nevertheless recognise that the _loto_ is not the same as the physical
     heart, _fatu_. In its function, the _loto_ apparently serves as the origin of a number of feelings,
     desires and thoughts which arise inside a person. Some external circumstance will cause
     “something to happen” or “something to arise” in the _loto_. But Samoans believe that some
     things can simply grow in the _loto_ for no apparent reason. (Gerber 1985:187).

For example,

__formgroup__
  Pn: Samoan              |loto vāivai|           [loto weak/tired] ‘timid’
  Pn: Samoan              |loto tele  |           [loto much] ‘brave’
  Pn: Samoan              |loto malie |           [loto sweet] ‘cooperative, compliant’

Although Samoan has a nominalised verb, _laŋona_ (from the verb ‘to feel, perceive with the
senses’), that groups together what we would refer to as feelings (anger, love) and sensations
(pain), the more emotional _laŋona_ can be distinguished by the fact that they are thought to
occur in the _loto_, while physical sensations stem from the body (Gerber:187).

   Polynesian languages have a way of identifying that a feeling is an enduring disposition
rather than a transient emotion by substituting reflexes of PPn _*aŋa_ ‘habit, custom, way of
acting’ for _*loto_. Thus:

__formgroup__
  Pn: Tongan              |loto fiemālie|         ‘contented, satisfied’
  Pn: Tongan              |aŋa fiemālie |         ‘of a contented and easy-going disposition’

This may lead to distinctions in meaning, as in

__formgroup__
  Pn: Samoan              |loto leaŋa |           ‘jealous of, be envious of’
  Pn: Samoan              |aŋa leaŋa  |           ‘unkind, cruel’
  Pn: Samoan              |loto vāivai|           ‘timid, afraid’
  Pn: Samoan              |aŋa vāivai |           ‘gentle, mild-tempered’

9.4     The emotion/cognition continuum: _*qate-_ vs _*lalom_

POc speakers wishing to express their feelings evidently had a choice between _*qate-_ and
_*lalom_, both reconstructed here with similar meanings. In this situation it is likely that they
were used in subtly different ways. The two may be represented as lying at opposite ends of a
continuum that spans emotions, temperamental qualities and non-emotional cognitive states, all
involving some kind of mental processing but not all involving strong physical expression. For
instance, there are feelings such as boredom and compassion and perplexity that may be
described as both an emotion and a mental state, and if the continuum serves as a measure of
physical expression these will be placed somewhere in the middle. It is apparent from the
glosses given to the _*qate-_ reflexes above that emotion is emphasised rather than mind (mind
is mentioned in the definition of the term only in SES languages). In contrast, the _*lalom_
reflexes refer to mind in all subgroups. Those Papuan Tip languages that use _*nua-_ ‘mind/
insides’ as a base for their cognitive states have used it to replace _*lalom_ reflexes while
retaining their _*qate-_ reflexes. Closer examination of languages where we have reasonable
amounts of data and where the relevant data is largely limited to BPMs using either ‘liver/belly/
heart’ or ‘insides’ may throw further light.

    In his Gedaged (NNG) dictionary, Mager gives roughly equal space, numbering several
dozen BPMs, to both those with _bube-_ ‘liver; heart as the seat of emotions, feelings,
character’, and those with _ilon-_ (reflecting _*lalom_) ‘insides; seat of thought, will and
emotions, and therefore in this sense the heart; mind, self, contents of memory’. Overwhelmingly,
emotions accompanied by strong physical feeling (gleeful, distraught, discouraged, in
turmoil etc.) and temperamental qualities (cowardly, proud, meek) are linked with _bube-_,
while mental states and processes (comprehend, determine, reflect, decide etc.) occur with
_ilon-_.

    Takia, closely related to Gedaged, also divides the field between _bube-_ ‘liver; heart as the
seat of emotions, feelings, character’ and _ilo-_ ‘insides; seat of thought, will and
emotions’ (Bruce Waters, unpublished vocabulary). Although in broad terms _bube-_ is used for
emotions such as ‘amazed, ‘very angry, ‘heart-felt satisfaction, and ‘hard-hearted, it is found in
fewer than 20 BPMs; _ilo-_ with over 200 examples, has a far wider range, including ‘desire’,
‘forget’, ‘forgive’, ‘tempt’, ‘worry’, ‘dislike’, ‘believe’, ‘agree’, ‘delight’, ‘be happy’, ‘afraid’,
‘confused’, ‘sad’, ‘relieved’, ‘confident’ and so on, feelings that might be thought of mainly as
states of mind rather than emotional states.

    Bugenhagen (2001) has endeavoured to summarise the situation in another NNG language.
In a comparison between the various body part terms employed in Mangap-Mbula,
Bugenhagen (p95) writes that body image expressions containing _kete_ ‘liver, chest’ (from
_*qate-_) never express pure cognition. He adds (p96) that “the preeminent emotional function
of _kete-_ is to express rash, impetuous responses which are not well thought through, and
strong emotions like anger”. In contrast, _lele_ (from _*lalom_) is rarely used to express any sort
of physical sensation or experience. The examples he gives with _lele_ (pp87–94) include more
controlled emotions like feeling contented, sorry for someone, troubled about something,
anxious, relieved, and a variety of cognitive functions like choosing, doubting, approving.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Mangap      |kete imap |          [liver end] ‘be astonished, have one’s breath taken away’
  NNG: Mangap      |lele iurur|          [insides be.putting] ‘perplexed, not knowing what one wants to do’
  NNG: Mangap      |lele iᵐbol|     [insides strong/firm] ‘not easily persuaded to do things’

                                                                           Body part metaphors 531


   Very few Nakanai BPMs are found in Chowning’s (2014) data, but those few support the
theory that in general _*qate-_ is favoured for impetuous, strong emotions while _*lalom_ is
preferred for non-emotional cognitive concepts:

__formgroup__
  MM: Nakanai            |la hate-la raga  |  [the liver -his leap] ‘he is startled’
  MM: Nakanai            |la hate-la mamasi|  [the liver -his stinging/burning/salty] ‘he is angry’
  MM: Nakanai            |ilo-buruko       |  [insides-sad] ‘mournful, sad, disturbed’
  MM: Nakanai            |ilo-vilovi       |  [insides-greedy] ‘greedy’
  MM: Nakanai            |ilo-tavu         |  [insides-summon/grasp] ‘mindful’

   However, there are examples from Yabem that indicate that the choice between ‘belly,
bowels, stomach’ or ‘insides’ is made on grounds that are more difficult to discern. Zahn &
Streicher’s Yabem dictionary lists about two dozen BPMs based on ŋalɪlʊm ‘inside; heart, as
seat of emotions’ (from _*lalom_) and over a hundred based on _têtaʔ_ ‘belly, bowels, stomach’
whose meaning is perhaps better captured by ‘guts’. A striking property of these is that a
dozen or so entries can be used with either base term, with little or no apparent change in
meaning:

__formgroup__
  NNG: Yabem    |tɪtaʔ lulu      |   [guts.his twofold] ‘he is in doubt’
  NNG: Yabem    |ŋalɪlʊm lulu    |   [his.insides-twofold] ‘he is in doubt’
  NNG: Yabem    |tɪtaʔ kekaʔ aɪ  |   [guts.his pulls me] ‘I feel compelled’
  NNG: Yabem    |ŋalɪlʊm kekaʔ aɪ|   [insides pull me] ‘I feel compelled’
  NNG: Yabem    |tɪtaʔ ŋawapaʔ   |   [guts.his heavy] ‘anxious, depressed, grieves, mourns’
  NNG: Yabem    |ŋalɪlʊm ŋawapaʔ  |  [his.insides heavy] ‘heavy-hearted, full of sorrow, dispirited’
  NNG: Yabem    |tɪtaʔ ŋadani     |  [guts.his thicket] ‘disinclined, is uneasy, anxious, has misgivings, unwilling, uncooperative, ungrateful’
  NNG: Yabem    |ŋalɪlʊm ŋadani   |  [his.insides thicket] ‘hard-hearted, inaccessible, reserved, taciturn’
  NNG: Yabem    |tɪtaʔ kɪtu malʊ  |  [guts.his it.stand peaceful] ‘contented, happy’
  NNG: Yabem    |ŋalɪlʊm kɪtu malʊ|  [his.insides it.stand peaceful] ‘appeased’

    Choice of term here evidently depends on finer points of personal interpretation of
circumstances, unknown to those outside the situation. Perhaps for some emotions the speaker
can choose whether to emphasise the physical nature of the feeling by using _têtaʔ_ (e.g.
‘happy’) or indicate that other circumstances are involved by using _ŋalêlôm_ (e.g. ‘appeased’).

    Further insight is raised by McElhanon (1977) regarding the relative uses of ‘belly’ vs
‘insides’ in Selepet, a non-Austronesian language of the Huon Gulf whose expressions closely
parallel those in this chapter. McElhanon writes:

532 Meredith Osmond

__blockquote__
     A working assumption is that the cognitive space allotted to the psychological function of
     any given body part is discrete. Therefore, if a lexicographer cites two or more body parts as
      constituting, for example, the ‘seat of the emotions’, it is possible that some basic and
      distinctive feature of the system has been overlooked. In the early stages of Selepet
      lexicography the analysts listed both the ‘belly’ and the ‘inside’ as representing the seat of
      the emotions. This was only superficially true because further investigation revealed that the
      former represents one’s emotions in a sociological context and expresses such feelings as
      generosity, approval, desire, lust, jealousy, loneliness, pity, selfishness, and reconciliation.
      The latter reflects one’s personal attitude or frame of mind and expresses feeling and
      attitudes such as diligence, faithfulness, tenacity, eagerness, anticipation, excitement,
      satisfaction, despair, anxiety and regret. Furthermore, it is used of one’s emotions and
      attitudes about others only if they are members of one’s immediate family. (McElhanon 1977:10)

    The insights of Bugenhagen and McElhanon indicate that the distinction in meaning
between ‘belly/liver’ and ‘insides’ may be very subtle, possibly varying from language to
language, and difficult to identify even by those with a close familiarity with the language.
Dictionary definitions do not provide enough scope for a researcher to identify such subtlties.
Perhaps the best that can be claimed is that, in POc daughter languages, emotions
accompanied by a strong physical sensation are more likely to be linked with _*qate-_ reflexes
while non-emotional mental states tend to use reflexes of _*lalom_. However, choice of term
may be influenced by finer points of personal interpretation or other circumstances, unknown
to those outside the situation. The question of POc usage can probably not be more clearly
defined without detailed semantic analysis of a range of languages across the Oceanic region,
far beyond the scope of the present study.

    However, notwithstanding the above, _*qate-_ remains preeminently the source of bravery in
its reflexes. The only qualities expressed by _*qate_-based metaphors in Motu, Marshallese, and
Bauan and Wayan Fijian, are those to do with bravery or its lack:

__formgroup__
  PT:  Motu                |ase kuro    |          [liver white] ‘brave’
  Mic: Marshallese         |eccelok acin|          [liver without] ‘he is not brave’
  Fij: Bauan               |yate levu   |          [liver big] ‘coward’
  Fij: Bauan               |yate lialia |          [liver foolish] ‘courageous’
  Fij: Wayan               |ate levu    |          [liver big] ‘coward’


9.5      The modifying terms

When used as a general expression of emotion, i.e. without additional contextual information,
the modifying terms tend to cluster around a limited number of physical attributes, e.g. (be)
‘good’, ‘bad’, ‘heavy’, ‘big’, ‘hot’, ‘hard’ and so on, terms that metaphorically evoke the
physical state of the experiencer when feeling happy, sad, angry and so on. Reflexes of POc
_*(p,pʷ)atu_ ‘outer shell, skull’ (§3.4.2.1), by extension, ‘firm, strong, unyielding’, are readily
applied to qualities like ‘stubborn’ or ‘brave’. More extreme emotions can be expressed more
vividly—a Lau BPM meaning ‘angry/violent’ is _rake ʔiri_ (_rake_ ‘heart, mind, seat of affections’;
_ʔiri_ ‘to chop up; impale’), while Samoan _loto-momomo_ ‘grief-stricken’ includes _momomo_
‘smashed in pieces’. Others like Lau _lio rodoa_ [voice dark] ‘sad’ and _lio mābe_ [voice soft]
‘peaceable, quiet, meek’ literally describe voice quality. Expressions of sadness may include a
verb meaning ‘hang the head’, e.g. Gela _lio ligi_ (_lio_ ‘seat of emotions’; _ligi_ ‘descend’). The Lau
BPM for ‘envy/jealousy’ is _ŋunu-ŋunu_, from _ŋunu_ ‘to murmur, whisper’. The Mota expression
_lolo suwa-suwa_ ‘loathing, feeling of repulsion’ includes _suwa_ ‘bow down and draw back’.

                                                                    Body part metaphors 533


   However, the biggest difficulty in capturing adequate translations of these metaphors is that
modifying words with the same basic meaning are capable of varying English interpretations.
Reflexes of POc _*wai-waiR_ ‘watery’ are found in Samoan _loto vāivai_ ‘timid, faint-hearted’,
while its Tokelauan cognate, _loto vāivai_ is glossed ‘discouraged, unhappy’. Mota _vara lava_
and Bauan Fijian _yate levu_ both have the literal meaning ‘liver big’ translatable as ‘coward,
cowardly’ while Tongan _loto lahi_ (loto big) is given the opposite interpretation, ‘brave/bold/
determined’. Bauan Fijian has two expressions that may be roughly translated as
‘courageous’: _yate dei_ (‘firm, unwavering liver’) and _yate lialia_ (‘mad, foolish liver’), thus
including additional components of meaning not present in the English term. Conversely,
Yabem (NNG), Kiriwina (PT) and Mota (NCV) all use a verb translated as ‘quiver’ to express
an emotion, but in Yabem the emotion is nervousness, anxiety (_ŋalɪlʊm ŋagogo_ ‘my inside
quivers’), in Kiriwina the emotion is astonishment, (_i-kubukubu nano-gu_ [it-quiver mind-my]
‘my mind quivers’), and in Mota the emotion is shame, shyness (_ape-maragai_ ‘my heart
quivers’).


9.6    Conclusion

Although a mere two POc reconstructions are identified in the following chapters—_*lalo- rua-rua_
‘be of two minds, undecided, have doubt’ (§10.8) and _*qate- (p,pʷ)atu_ ‘brave’ (§11.3.2.1)—
there is ample evidence across subgroups of particular feelings or thoughts being expressed by
BPMs that share the same underlying metaphor. Expression of such concepts in this way is a
well-established feature of Austronesian languages, apparently as far back as Proto
Austronesian, as BPMs encoding emotions are found in Tsou (Huang 2000b), which scholars
agree is either part of a three-language first-order Austronesian subgroup or a first-order
subgroup in its own right. Blust (ACD) has partially reconstructed several PMP terms _*X qatay_,
where the BPMs are consistently translatable as ‘afraid’ (literally ‘small liver’), ‘brave,
courageous, proud, arrogant’ (‘big liver’), ‘angry, furious’ (‘burning liver’), ‘full of
malice’ (‘rotten liver’), ‘resentful, offended’ (‘sick, hurt liver’) and ‘pure-hearted’ (‘white
liver’). The modifying terms are not all cognate, but they share the same meaning. Klamer (2001)
suggests that _eti_ ‘liver’ (from PMP _*qatay_) was the Kambera (CMP) term for ‘seat of
emotions’, whilst the corresponding term in Buru (CMP) was _lale-_ ‘inside’, cognate with POc
_*lalom_. It is thus reasonably certain that BPMs with both _*qate-_ and _*lalom_ were inherited into
POc from an earlier Austronesian interstage.

    Our inability to reconstruct more BPMs than are presented here can be attributed to several
factors.

__block__
- the tendency inherent in us all, but perhaps particularly so among people with a
  strong rhetorical tradition, to continually rework the images contained in metaphors
  so that they remain vivid. Perhaps this is the reason that base terms other than _*qate-_
  and _*lalom_ are often replaced by, for example, terms meaning ‘mind’, ‘voice’ or
  ‘throat’.
- the tendency of daughter languages to divide up the _*qate-_/_*lalom_ continuum in
  idiosyncratic ways.
- the fact that we are seeking to reconstruct ways in which POc speakers lexified their
  emotional spectrum by dictionary searches - that is, by looking first for equivalent
  terms for English words.

534 Meredith Osmond


Expanding on the third point, qualifying words are capable of varying interpretations, as
illustrated in §9.5 above. A Tokelauan speaker’s expression _loto vāivai_ may be translated in one
place by ‘weary’, in another by ‘discouraged, unhappy’. In other words, there is no precisely
defined relationship that holds between a metaphor and its physical attribute. English
translations may seize on one aspect of a word’s meaning, but ignore other equally valid
interpretations. The only instances where a one-to-one relationship may hold across languages
is where a numerical modifier is used, as in the cognitive concepts ‘to doubt’ and ‘to agree’.
Here ‘to doubt’ is expressed literally as ‘to be of two minds’, and ‘to agree’ is ‘to be of one
mind’ (§§10.8–9). Terms collected across the Oceanic-speaking world for these two
expressions show remarkable uniformity of gloss: the English translation is semantically an
exact fit.

    Compound expressions for emotions, temperamental qualities and some cognitive states
have only been recorded in a small number of the available dictionaries, and those listed are
undoubtedly only a fraction of those in use. But dictionary translations are rarely adequate for
the purposes of this chapter and chapters 10 and 11. Oceanic speakers may lexify the
emotional spectrum in ways that differ significantly from an English speaker. For instance, a
Kiribati term is _nano-mano_, defined by Sabatier (1971) as ‘discreet, deep, sly, sullen’ (_nano_
‘inside, disposition etc.’, _mano_ ‘impervious, water-tight’). To an English speaker these
character traits are quite distinct in meaning, and although some shared element of meaning
can be identified, there is no English term that encompasses them all. Consequently, it must be
recognised that any comparison of dictionary terms with similar English glosses is a poor
substitute for comprehensive discussion of such terms on a language-by-language basis.

    White (1985:329) argues that “with a topic as complex, affectively charged, and socially
significant as this (the linguistic expressions for personal characteristics or emotions), analysis
of language quickly moves from the study of referential semantics to questions of inference
and pragmatics”.

    And such matters are beyond dictionary definitions.



10 Cognition

10.1 Introduction

A cognition verb like ‘know’, ‘think’, ‘understand’ or ‘remember’ denotes a concept that
speakers are aware of because it denotes an event within their own minds, but often has only
indirect correlates in the perceived world. As a result, speakers of different languages classify
cognitive events in rather different ways, requiring us first to gain some insight into how
speakers of present-day Oceanic languages classify these events.

   English cognition verbs tend to cover a range of events. The verb think has a considerable
range of meanings:

__block__
 1. _Don’t talk to me—I’m thinking._ (cogitation)
 2. _I think John stole the key._ (belief, opinion)
 3. _I didn’t think of it_ (‘I forgot it.’)
 4. _I thought I would go shopping_ (intention)
 5. _I keep thinking about poor Mary_ (‘I’m worried because she is ill’ OR ‘I’m saddened by
   her death’ OR ‘I would like to be with her’)

To be sure, a native speaker disambiguates each meaning in context. The progressive aspect in
the present tense (… _am thinking_) in (1) indicates that this is thinking in the sense of cogitation.
The complement clause (… _I would go shopping_) in (4) points to intention.

   There is probably no other language in the world with a verb whose range of meanings
exactly corresponds to those of English _think_ (not even close neighbours like French or
German do), but many of our sources give English glosses consisting of a single cognition
verb like ‘think’, leaving us ignorant of how the verb thus glossed is used.

   To gain insight into how speakers of present-day Oceanic languages classify cognitive
events, we have first tried to ensure that we compare like with like semantically. A list of
semantic frames for cognition terms was drawn up. A semantic frame is a description of an
event, relation, or entity and the participants involved in it.[1] Making the list was a two-step
procedure. First, the [FrameNet website](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/) was consulted.
It provides semantic frames for a very
large number of English lexemes and, for example, distinguishes the various senses of English
_think_. Second, frames were defined that reflect meanings found in dictionaries of Oceanic
languages for cognitive states and activities. Semantic frame labels appear below in small
capitals. Terms for each frame were found in dictionaries of four Oceanic languages: Nakanai
(MM; Chowning 2014), To’aba’ita (SES; Lichtenberk 2008), Mwotlap (NCV; François 2012)
and Wayan Fijian (Pawley & Sayaba 2003) and are tabulated in the sections on knowing
(§10.2), thinking (§10.3) and remembering (§10.5). This constituted a check of the
appropriateness of the list of frames and of their possible representation in POc. In the event,
several cognition frames that were supported by dictionary glosses did not lead to the
reconstruction either of forms or of metaphorical structures, and they are omitted here. These
include ‘not know, be ignorant’ (often a simple verb), ‘think about, long for’, ‘be on one’s
mind, have s.t. on one’s mind’, ‘remember to do s.t.’, ‘forget to do s.t.’, ‘hope’ and ‘expect’.

[1] Semantic frames are part of Frame Semantics, a theory of meaning deriving from the work of Charles J.
    Fillmore (see especially Fillmore 1982, 1985, Croft & Cruse 2004:8–22 and passim.).

536 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   A larger language sample would have been ideal, but identifying semantic frames requires
sentence examples. These are absent from Chowning (2014), but the latter is the best available
dictionary of a MM language. Because semantic frames are subject to borrowing by bilingual
speakers, and NNG and PT languages have all been in contact with Papuan languages at
various points in their histories, they are probably poor indicators of POc’s frames and were
therefore excluded from the sample, meaning that WOc could be appropriately represented
only by a MM language.

   There is a tendency for terms denoting abstractions to be metaphors that refer to less
abstract concepts. Metaphors in turn are often encoded by complex lexemes; that is, lexemes
made up of two or more simple lexemes. Complex lexemes include body-part metaphors
(BPMs; ch.9), serial verb constructions (SVCs),[3] and compounds derived from either of these,
and apparently these have long been productive lexeme-creating devices, as they are also
present in Central Malayo-Polynesian and South Halmahera/West New Guinea languages and
were apparently constructions of Proto Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. We can be sure
that complex lexemes with these structures occurred in POc.

   Each section below discusses a single cognition frame or a set of related frames. Sections
discussing further frames could be added, but these would not contain reconstructed forms.
They would at best list the meanings of complex lexemes together with supporting data, and
these are already well enough represented in the chapter.


10.2 Knowing

Verbs encoding three semantic frames denote knowledge in Oceanic languages:

__block
-   AWARE, e. g. ‘I know that he is coming.’
-   ACQUAINTED, e. g. ‘I know him well.’
-   EXPERT, e. g. ‘I know how to plant yams.’

[3] Oceanic SVCs are described by Crowley (2002d) and in the contributions to Bril & Ozanne-Rivierre (2004).

                                                                                        Cognition 537


Their distribution across verbs in the four witness languages is shown in Table 22.[4] In Mwotlap,
Wayan and To’aba’ita one verb is used for all three frames, but To’aba’ita also has dedicated
EXPERT verbs. Nakanai has distinct verbs in each frame, but the AWARE verb _rovi_ also occurs in
the ACQUAINTED compound _rovi-lala_. The morpheme _-lala_ is perhaps related (diachronically, at
least) to _lalai_ ‘to try (to do s.t.)’. If so, it has a similar meaning to To’aba’ita _toʔo_, which means
‘to try, test’ in a number of compound verbs (§8.5) including apparently _θaitoʔoma-_ ‘know’,
but does not occur independently.

: Table 22         Verbs of knowing in the four witness languages

__table__
                | AWARE                 |  ACQUAINTED                  |  EXPERT
                | ‘know (s.t. /that …)’ | ‘know/recognise (s.o.)’      |  ‘know/learn (how to …)’
    Nakanai     |  __rovi__               | _mata-kilala_ [look-(know)]    |   _tahai_, _mari_
                |                       |  __rovi__-_lala_ [know-? ]         |
    To’aba’ita  | __θai-toʔoma-__ [(know)-?] | __θai-toʔoma-__ [(know)-? ] | __θaitoʔoma-__, _filo-_, _filoŋani-_, _maʔalutani-_ [eye-? ], _dau-fīfirisi-_ [? -thoroughly]
    Mwotlap     | __eɣlal__   | __eɣlal__   | __eɣlal__
    Wayan       | __kilāti-__ | __kilāti-__ | __kilāti-__

    The glosses on the second line of Table 22 are intended to capture the fact that in certain
contexts (e. g. in the presence of a perfective marker) ACQUAINTED and EXPERT verbs often have
dynamic punctual senses, respectively ‘recognise (s.o.)’ and ‘learn (how to …)’.

    The POc ‘know’ verb with the most widely distributed reflexes is _*kilala_. It appears to
have had AWARE, ACQUAINTED and EXPERT senses, to judge from the more specific glosses in the
cognate set below, but it is difficult to be certain. WOc glosses match the PMP gloss,
ACQUAINTED. The trisyllabic form is unusual, and there is reasonable evidence for a transitive
alternant _*kila-i-_ from which the third root syllable was deleted.

[4] Bolded verbs are identical across frames. Glosses in square brackets give senses of compound elements.
    Parentheses indicate that an element does not occur independently with this meaning, which is inferred
    either from occurrence in several compounds or from cognates in closely related languages.

   A number of languages have verbs that are formally similar to the reflexes above but have
meanings that indicate that they more probably reflect POc _*kilat_ (VI) ‘be seen clearly,
discerned, recognised’, (VT) ‘see clearly, discern, recognise’ (§8.2).

__formgroup__

  Pn:  Rennellese            kiga            (VSt) ‘be clearly seen, in plain sight’

The Wayan verb _kilāti-_ ‘know’, on the other hand, conflates a form reflecting _*kilat_ with the
sense ‘know’.

   From the glosses of the data below, POc _*qataq_, _*qataq-i-_ evidently meant ‘know,
understand, realise (that)’, encoding AWARE. In a few languages the verb has the same form as
the reflex of _*qate-_ ‘liver’ (§3.7.6). Despite the role played by _*qate-_ in bodypart metaphors,
particularly those expressing emotions (§9.2.1), however, the resemblance seems to have
emerged by chance. Final _*-q_ is attested in Mutu and Namakir.

   POc evidently had another term with an EXPERT meaning, _*taqu_, but it is reflected with
reasonable certainty only in Anejom (SV) and in Polynesian languages, and two PPn terms are
reconstructable: _*tau_ ‘skilful at, familiar with’ and _*mātau_ ‘know, understand, be
experienced’. The latter has an apparent Banoni (MM) cognate, allowing the reconstruction of
POc _*ma-taqu_ (_*ma-_ was a stative formative; §1.3.5.4).

   It is well known that in many languages a perception verb may also mean ‘know,
understand (s.t.)’ (Aikhenvald & Storch 2013, Evans & Wilkins 2000, Viberg 1984). English
uses ‘I see’ to mean ‘I understand’, i.e. an AWARE sense. This semantic extension occurs
occasionally in Oceanic languages. A few NNG languages use a reflex of POc _*reki[-]_,
_*reqi[-]_ ‘see, look, see s.t., look at s.t.’ (§8.2) also in the sense ‘know’:

__formgroup__
    NNG: Mangap                re                ‘see, look, experience; consider, think, be aware’
  NNG: Yabem                liʔ                 ‘see, look at s.t., know, have experience’
  NNG: Lamogai              rik                 ‘see, know’

   A similar extension of meaning occurs with PPn _*kite_ ‘see, appear, know’ from POc _kita-i-_
‘see s.t.’, and Raga (NCV) _ilo_ ‘know, perceive’ from POc _*qilo_ ‘be aware of, discern,
see’ (§8.2). The transitive reflex of POc _*qilo_, namely PPn _*qilo-_ (VI) ‘to know, be aware’,
(VT) ‘know s.t.’, had been fully repurposed as a verb of knowing.

   Reflexes of POc _*roŋoR-_ ‘hear s.t., listen to s.t.’[5] with the additional sense ‘know’ are
sufficiently widespread to raise the possibility that this sense was already present in POc.

   Lexical replacement has evidently been frequent among verbs of knowing, and many

The verbs below reflect _*sagova_, _*sagov-i-_ ‘know’, reconstructable to a lower-order interstage

All languages below reflect _*b<in>isi_, but Nokuku also reflects _*bisi_, implying that _*bisi_ is the

reanalysed as a verb in these languages.

   Interestingly, many Oceanic languages have distinct verbs for ‘not know (s.t.), be ignorant
of (s.t.)’ and for ‘not recognise (s.o.)’, but none of the terms found is cognate with any of the
others. Some terms are evidently monomorphemic, like Lou _tɔn_ ‘not know’, Mangap _-kus_ ‘not
recognise’, Takia _-ŋaoŋ_ ‘not know’, whilst others, like Balawaia _ɣita-lea_ ‘not recognise’ (_ɣita_
‘see’ + _lea_ ‘miss’) and Wayan _kila sēti-_ ‘not recognise’ (_kila_ ‘know (s.t., s.o)’ + _sēti-_ ‘do s.t.
wrongly’) are clearly serial verb constructions.


10.3 Thinking

Across languages verbs of thinking fall into two broad semantic frames:

                                                                                   Cognition 543

__block__
-    OPINE, e. g. ‘I think/believe that he is coming.’
-    COGITATE, e. g. ‘I think of/about him/this a lot.’

Table 23 shows that in all four witness languages there is a verb (in bold) that embraces both
frames, but in Nakanai, To’aba’ita and Wayan there are other verbs with somewhat more
specialised meanings. None of this is surprising. English has believe, surmise, guess, suspect
and suppose as OPINE verbs, and a number of COGITATE verbs: cogitate on, consider, ponder,
reflect on, contemplate and others, each with a different shade of meaning. Dictionaries often
do not encapsulate these shades of meaning well.

: Table 23     Verbs of thinking in the four witness languages

__table__
                | OPINE                          |  COGITATE
                | ‘think/believe (s.t. /that …)’ | ‘think about/consider (s.t.)’
    Nakanai     | __gabu__, _ule_, _vei_, _kau_  |  __gabu__, _aliale_, _loho-tavu_ [cogitate-towards], _ilo-tavu_  [inside-towards], _hilo-tavu_ [see-towards]

    Wayan       | __nūmi-__                      |      __nūmi-__, _lēŋa-i-_

    OPINE verbs seem to occur less frequently in Oceanic discourse than they do in European
languages, and there are at least two reasons for this.

    First, OPINE verbs differ from AWARE verbs (§10.2) in that a complement clause of the latter
is taken to be a fact, whereas the complement clause of an OPINE is not. _I know John is a teacher_
entails the proposition _John is a teacher_ as a fact, but _I think John is a teacher_ doesn’t
guarantee the truth of the proposition. One result of this is that in English _I think_ is often little
more than a marker of possibility, i.e. ‘perhaps’. The Tok Pisin term for ‘perhaps’ is _ating_,
transparently reflecting English _I think_, and many Oceanic languages have a corresponding
sentence adverb that is glossed in dictionaries ‘perhaps, I think’; e. g., Mangseng (NNG) _ava_,

Sursurunga (MM) _gut_, Teop (MM) _aekas_, Kwaio (SES) _baleʔe_, Mwotlap (NCV) _so_. Of these,
however, only the Tawala adverb has a derivational relationship to an OPINE verb (see below),
and it seems that in Oceanic languages OPINE verbs typically do not have this bleached
‘perhaps’ function.

    Second, OPINE is quite often expressed by a languages’s default verb of saying, so that in
Baluan (Adm), for example, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the speaker intends the
complement of _pʷa_ to be spoken or simply thought (Dineke Schokkin, pers. comm.).

as both _I say that is not good_ and _I think that is not good_. Thus the meaning of the example
‘say/think’ verbs listed below is something like ‘formulate in words, either spoken or
unspoken’.

    Hence OPINE verbs in Oceanic languages are centrally about mental activity, and it is not
surprising that Table 23 shows them overlapping with COGITATE verbs. Indeed, no dedicated
POc OPINE verb that is not also a speech verb is reconstructable.

    Glosses of reflexes of POc _*nonom_ ‘think, remember; mind, thought’ point quite strongly
to it being a COGITATE verb with a semantic focus on thinking about or remembering
something. Its reconstruction, though, involves some ad hoc assumptions about the history of
the apparent reflexes listed below. These display a somewhat abstract formal template
_nVNV[N]_, where N is _n_ or _m_, but _m_ occurs no more than once in a reflex. The shape is that of
POc _*nonom_ (V) ‘think’, (N) ‘mind, thought’, the expected reflex of PAn _*nemnem_
‘think’ (ACD). However, Blust (ACD) notes Fordata (CMP) _nanaŋ_ ‘remember, remember
sadly’, with _-a-_ twice for expected _-e-_ (< PAn _*-e-_). This suggests that there was an alternant
of the form _*nanam_ as far back as PCEMP, perhaps ancestral to some of the forms listed
below. Treating the forms below as a cognate set also assumes that the presence of three nasals
led to metathesis in Seimat and Nehan (_*nVnVm_ > _*nVmVn_), and to assimilation of point of
articulation in Bariai, Babatana and Ririo (_*nVnVm_ > _*nVnVn_).

    The Wayan transitive verb _num-i-_ (VT) ‘think of s.t.’ requires special mention.
As Blust (1977a) shows, a POc intransitive verb of the form C1V1-C1V1C2 often had a corresponding
transitive of the form _C1V1C2-i_. Thus POc _*nonom_ may have been paired with transitive
_*nom-i_, of which Wayan _num-i-_ is the only reflex known to us. Alternatively, it may be a
back-formation from intransitive *nanum, reflected in Bauan nanu.

   The two verbs discussed below, POc _*drodrom_ ‘think, worry; love, be sorry for, long for’
and POc _*nuka_ ‘think, feel’, are both COGITATE verbs, but both also have emotional overtones.
Indeed, glosses in Oceanic dictionaries suggest that cogitation and worry or longing frequently
go together.

   Although its reflex is the Mwotlap default verb for thinking (Table 23), the NCV evidence,
presented in some detail below, suggests that the POc verb was a COGITATE verb with an
emotional overtone of ‘love, be sorry for, long for’, i.e. the SORRY semantic frame recognised
in §11.4.3. Indeed, the emotion-related meanings are the only ones recorded for the Nakanai,
Nokuku, Namakir, Nguna and S Efate reflexes, and they also figure in the Tamambo and
Uripiv glosses. The expected POc reflex of PAn _*demdem_ is POc †_*rodrom_ (_*-md-_ > _*-nd-_ >
_-dr-_), but maintaining the consistency of reduplication is perhaps responsible for _*drodrom_.
Transitive _*drom-i_ arose via the template recognised by Blust (1977a).

    POc _*nuka_ ‘think, feel’ was also evidently a COGITATE verb, but with a sense of associated
emotion—desire for its object. In some daughter languages the reflex of _*nuka_ is a verb, in
others a monovalent body-part noun meaning ‘mind’, ‘thought’, ‘feeling’, or ‘desire’, and in
yet others both a nominal and a verbal reflex occurs. When it occurs in complex lexemes, it is
sometimes difficult to tell whether it is a verb or a noun, and a rule of thumb is adopted such
that it is glossed as a verb ‘think’ unless there is clear evidence that it is a monovalent noun.

    The reconstruction of *nuka is a little problematic with regard to its medial _*-k-_, and it is
tempting to avoid irregularity by splitting the data into two formally similar cognate sets.
However, the glosses imply quite strongly that this is a single set. The irregularity occurs in
the Micronesian reflexes. Woleaian _nʉ-nʉwa-n_ and Ifaluk _nu-nuwa-n_ reflect either _*nua_ or
_*nuqa_, whereas Carolinian _lɨxɨ-lɨx_ reflects _*nuka_. The Adzera medial _-g-_ and Tolai and
Ramoaaina final _-k_ reduce the choice to _*nuqa_ or _*nuka_, but could reflect either (final _*-q_ is
occasionally retained in New Ireland languages). Since _*q_ is lost in Micronesian languages
and the reflexes of _*-k-_ in Chuukic languages like Woleaian and Ifaluk are known to be
complex and not always regular (Jackson 1983:175–185), it makes sense to treat the
Carolinian reflex as criterial and to reconstruct _*nuka_. The MM and PT reflexes in which _*-k-_
is thus deemed to be lost are all regular.

    The inherited core meaning of POc _*manaca(m)_ was evidently ‘tame (of animals), familiar
to’ (of people). Its form—_*ma-_ + disyllabic root—indicates that it was originally a stative
verb, but the glosses of the forms below suggest that it came also to be used of people in the
senses ‘quiet, thoughtful, learned’, and then developed the meanings ‘know, understand, think
about’ and was also used as an abstract noun. In a number of languages it became the base for
a transitive verb. In some languages the original meaning has been lost, but the retention of
‘tame’ as one of its senses in Lau, ’Are’are, Sa’a, Arosi and Owa attests to something like this
series of semantic developments. Reflexes vary in meaning between AWARE and COGITATE.

10.4 True and believing to be true

In those Oceanic languages for which there are relevant data6 believing something to be true
usually differs lexically from OPINE (§10.3) and thus forms a separate semantic frame, here
labelled BELIEVE. In most of these languages, the basic BELIEVE predicate is a complex form,
either a derived verb or, less commonly, a BPM, involving a stative verb root meaning ‘true, real,
genuine, correct, right’, a frame here labelled TRUE. The most widespread derivation is a TRUE
verb preceded by the prefix that forms causative verbs, reflecting POc _*pa[ka]-_. Verbs with this
form are listed in Table 24.

    From the examples in Table 24 it seems likely that there was a POc believe verb of the
form _*pa[ka]-_ + true verb, but its form is uncertain. The glosses of _*pa[ka]-_ + true verbs in
the table point to the likelihood that the basic meaning of POc _*pa[ka]-_ + true was ‘verify as
true’, and that ‘believe (s.t.) to be true’ was a secondary meaning. Other derivations with a true
root are listed in Table 25. The Takia lexeme is a BPM, and the Owa lexeme is a compound
derived from a BPM. The Gela, Longgu, Sa’a and Pn forms are evidently compounds derived
from SVCs.

[6] In a number of languages for which there are otherwise good data, including Nakanai and Mwotlap, two
    of our witness languages, BELIEVE terms are not recorded.
                                                                                Cognition 549


    It follows from the material in Tables 21 and 22 that the term to be reconstructed is the
stative verb for the true frame rather than a believe verb. In other words, this is an instance
where the basic lexeme was a stative verb with the stimulus as subject: ‘X is true’ rather than
‘I believe X’.

It is tempting to combine the set below with the set above. All the forms above could reflect
putative _*tuquna_, with regular loss of _*-q-_ and shortening of resulting _*-uu-_. However, none of
the forms below would be regular reflexes, as they fail to reflect either _*-a_ or _*-na_ as predicted
by regular sound change. Either the formal similarity between _*tuna_ and _*(t,d)uqu_ is
accidental, or they were associated at some point in their history by an unknown derivational
process.

    Overlapping semantically with the TRUE frame is the STRAIGHT frame, as Oceanic verbs
meaning ‘straight’ tend strongly also to have the metaphorical sense ‘correct’, a component of the
TRUE frame. Some reflexes of POc _*tonuq_ ‘straight, correct’ have the additional sense ‘true’, and
it seems possible that contamination by reflexes of *tuna has occurred, resulting in forms that
appear to reflect †_*tunuq_ rather than _*tonuq_. On the strength of Nokuku _ta-tino_ ‘true’ and Kiai
_tu-tunu_ ‘good, straight, sweet’ below, all the NCV forms have been attributed to _*tunuq_, but some
may either reflect _*tuna_ above or a contamination of one form by the other.

   Several forms with initial _*m-_ meaning ‘true’ can be reconstructed. The reason is perhaps
that each has its origins in a form with the PMP anticausative/stative prefix _*ma-_. This is
certainly true of reflexes of POc _*ma-qoli_ and _*ma-qoni_, both ‘true, real’. Despite their formal
and semantic similarity, they appear to have been separate POc terms. Their similarity has
almost certainly led to crossovers in meaning and to conflation of the two terms, as apparently
no language other than Anutan reflects both—and the gloss of Anutan maori ‘indigenous, true,
close of kin’ suggests it is borrowed from an EPn language. No EPn language has a reflex of
*ma-qoni. Proto Eastern Polynesian _*ma-qoni_ acquired the additional sense ‘native, indigenous’, giving rise to
the terms Māori and Mōriori for the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand and New
Zealand’s Chatham Islands respectively.

[7] In vol.2:212, _*[t,d]onu(p)_ ‘straight’ was reconstructed. The PT reflexes now show that the final
    consonant was _*-q_. Reflexes of initial _*t-_ and _*d-_ both occur, and the latter are listed under ‘cf. also’.
    They give grounds for reconstructing a POc doublet _*donuq_ ‘straight, correct’. How it arose is
    unknown, but _*d_ was the least frequently occurring of all the POc obstruents, reflecting an earlier _*nt_
    sequence.

   Perhaps the clearest indicator that the terms originally had slightly different meanings is the
contrast in meaning between the PPn causatives PPn _*faka-moqoli_ ‘assent (V)’ and PPn
_*faka-maqoni_ ‘tell the truth, be honest’.

   There is evidence that Gela, Lau and S Efate reflexes (shown under ‘cf. also’ below) of
POc _*ma-qoli_ ‘true, real’ have been conflated with those of POc _*maqurip_ ‘be alive, live,
flourish’ (§4.2.1.1). All three reflect POc _*-r-_ rather than _*-l-_, and the Gela and Lau reflexes
mean ‘alive’ as well as ‘real’.

   A small number of forms meaning ‘true’, all Northwest or Southeast Solomonic, reflect a
root _*mana_. It is tempting to associate these with POc *mʷane ‘straight, direct; flat, level’ (Vol.
2:213),[9] and this is probably the origin of Gela _mae-mane_ ‘correct’ below. However, neither
forms nor meaning otherwise support this association. It is possible that these forms are
cognate with PPn _*mana_ ‘supernatural power’ (POLLEX) and reflect the term that Blust (ACD)
reconstructs as POc _*mana_ ‘power in natural phenomena; thunder, storm wind’. However, the
glosses below suggest (i) that _*mana_/_*ma-mana_ was a homophone of Blust’s reconstruction,
and (ii) that the Simbo and Lau reflexes below reflect a conflation of Blust’s POc _*mana_
‘power…‘ and _*mana_ ‘true’. Since all reflexes of the latter are located in the Solomons
archipelago, it is difficult to know which interstage it should be attributed to.

[8] In his dictionary of Arosi Fox (1978) takes _moi_ ‘true’ to be an ‘abbreviated’ form of _mori_ ‘true’ (under
    _*maqurip_ above), but this is not a regular phonological process in the language.

[9] In vol.2 this form was reconstructed as _*mʷane-mʷane_, but the reduplication is not justified by the data.

10.5 Remembering

Probably all Oceanic languages have terms for MEMORISE (‘commit s.t. to memory’) and for
RECALL (‘remember s.t. /that…’), but these terms are usually complex lexemes, (§10.1). The
glosses of their components are given henceforth in square brackets. Table 26 sets out terms for
the two semantic frames in the four witness languages.

__table__
                    | MEMORISE                     |     RECALL
                    | ‘commit (s.t.) to memory’    |     ‘remember (s.t. /that …)’
       Nakanai      | _mata-toro_ [look-strong]    |     _hilo-tavu_ [see-towards]
       To’aba’ita   |                              |     _manata oli uri-_ [think back about]
       Mwotlap      |                              |     _dem sas_ [think find]
       Wayan        | _katoni-_ ‘put in box’,      |     _numi-lesu-ni-_ [think-back-TR],
                    | _bolani-_ ‘put in basket’    |     _divi-_ ‘daydream, remember longingly’

The absence of MEMORISE lexemes in Mwotlap and To’aba’ita typifies their absence from many
dictionaries. The data are so sparse that they will not be further considered here. The Wayan verbs
are simple metaphors: _katoni-_ is derived from _kato_ ‘container with lid’ and bolani- from _bola_
‘coconut leaf basket, container with lid’.

     The default POc RECALL verb was apparently _*nonom_, _*nanam_ ‘think about s.t., remember
s.t.’, reconstructed in §10.3. It encoded both RECALL and COGITATE frames. The only simple
RECALL verb in Table 26 is the Wayan verb _divi-_ ‘daydream, remember longingly’, but this
includes the additional sense of longing, quite common in RECALL verbs in Oceanic languages.

     The remaining RECALL terms in Table 26 are complex lexemes, and three of them begin with
the language’s default COGITATE verb. In this they are typical of Oceanic RECALL terms outside
Polynesia. It is possible that, for example, the ‘think + find’ sequence immediately below is of
POc antiquity, but the data do not allow us to reconstruct the forms that occurred in this and other
complex lexemes.

     An effect of employing complex lexemes is that they may encode more specific meanings
than English usually encodes with remember. Thus one sense of remember, as in ‘He managed to
remember the address’, views remembering as finding a piece of information in one’s memory
after a search, encoded by a SVC ‘think + find’:

__formgroup__
  PT: Dobu                  |nua loba    |        [think find] ‘think and finally remember’

  NCV: Paamese              |mudem sāli  |        [think find. out] ‘remember, discover’

These data imply the existence of a compound lexeme meaning ‘search one’s memory for s.t.’,
and examples occur, but sometimes with rather vague glosses. Here and below, languages
around the Vitiaz Strait replace ‘think’ or ‘mind’ with ‘eye’, giving a BPM.

   Remembering in the sense of casting one’s mind back, recalling and recollecting is often
expressed by the sequence ‘think + go back’ or sometimes ‘think again’. Note below that Iduna
has two syntactically different variants of the same expression. In one, _nua-_ ‘mind’, a monovalent
noun, is subject of the verb _-nauye-_ ‘go back’. The other is a compound verb made up of the same
morphemes.

  Remembering in the MEMORISE sense of holding something in one’s memory is expressed in a
number of WOc languages by the sequence ‘think + hold’, or in Nehan by a simple ‘hold’
metaphor.

Much the same concept is occasionally expressed by a ‘think + stay’ sequence:

   In many Oceanic languages, serialisation and compounding have remained productive, and
there are complex lexemes that appear to be quite localised:

  NCV: Paamese             |mudem silati  |      [think come. across. by. chance] ‘suddenly recall’


10.6 Forgetting

Like terms for RECALL, many terms for forgetting are complex lexemes, the first component of
which is either the default COGITATE verb or the body-part noun that the language uses for ‘mind’.
The second component is a verb, the meanings of which are in several instances quite
widespread. There are dozens of combinations in the data. A geographically well distributed
combination is ‘think/mind’ + ‘lose’.

__formgroup__
  Adm: Nyindrou            |bale- mani  |        [neck lose] ‘forget, lose’
  NNG: Bariai              |mata- sapian|        [eye lose] ‘forget’

  NCV: Lonwolwol           |nɔ̄r helalɛ |        [think lose] ‘forget’

    Another is ‘think/mind’ + ‘short’, where ‘short’ is apparently used metaphorically for
‘lacking’. The two terms below are from the opposite geographic extremes of MM.

__formgroup__
  MM: Poeng                |lau pogo  |          [liver.my be.short] ‘forget’
  MM: Maringe              |ɣaðo kmoʔe|          [think be.short] ‘forget’

   The existence of a verb meaning ‘not know’ in many Oceanic languages was noted in §10.2. It
figures as the second component of the following lexemes.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia               |ilo- -ŋaoŋ |         [inside- -not know] ‘forget’
  PT:  Iamalele            |nua-fani   |         [think-not.know] ‘forget’
  PT:  Iamalele            |nua- -fani |         [mind- -not.know] ‘forget’

  SES: To’aba’ita          |lio-dorā   |         [look-not.know] ‘forget (about)’
  SES: Kwaio               |maa-bolosia|         [eye-not.know] ‘forget’

    A number of complex lexemes glossed ‘forget’ have a verb meaning ‘leave, go away’ as one
of their components, usually the second. However, some of these have glosses—‘abandon’,
‘leave behind’—that imply a conscious choice to forget.

   Clark (2009:130) reconstructs a PNCV BPM _*lolo- boŋi_ [mind night] ‘forget’, and infers that
one component or the other has been replaced in various languages. He may well be right, but a
more conservative inference is that a complex lexeme ‘mind’ + ‘night’ was present in early EOc.
The terms for ‘night’ reflect either POc _*rodrom_ ‘be dark, be night’ or POc _*boŋi_
‘night’ (vol.2:295–298). In some languages this BPM also has the sense ‘be ignorant’ (§11.3.4.1).

10.7 Deciding

The gloss ‘decide’ is rare in dictionaries of Oceanic languages, implying that deciding is not an
Oceanic concept. One reason for this is that major decisions are traditionally made by
consensus, for which—if one digs far enough—a term can be found. Its meaning, though, often
includes the foregoing discussion as well as the decision.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia     |awa- -tumani|   [mouth confer] ‘agree, decide together, come to consensus, take counsel (with each other)’
  NNG: Mapos Buang    |jō ɢaɢek|    [tie.knot speech] ‘decide, agree, to finish a discussion and come to a conclusion’
  MM: Nehan           uel-halata    [RECIP-discuss] ‘decide; discuss, decide together’
  Fij: Wayan            boseti-        ‘confer about s.t., meet to discuss or decide on s.t.’

No reconstruction can be made, and no consistent BPM pattern has been found.

    On the rather rare occasions that one finds a term that appears to denote individual
decision-making, it typically also includes either a reference to planning or to choosing.
Indeed, the gloss ‘plan’ occurs rather more frequently than ‘decide’, but again no
reconstruction is possible. ‘Choosing’, on the other hand, is clearly an Oceanic concept, and a
verb can be reconstructed (§10.10).

    When one searches a dictionary for ‘decide’, the gloss ‘undecided’ frequently turns up, and
this is the topic of the next section.


10.8 Being undecided, of two minds

   The English idioms ‘be of two minds’ (this section) and ‘be of one mind’ (§10.9) translate as
semantically similar BPMs in Oceanic languages.

   Numerous expressions in Oceanic languages for ‘be undecided’ translate roughly as ‘be of
two minds’. Expressions for ‘be undecided’ have been found in three of the four witness
languages, and examples are given in Table 27.

   The Nakanai example and the first To’aba’ita example are BPMs, with a body-part as
subject and ‘two’ as predicate. The second To’aba’ita example is a compound verb, ‘mind’ +
‘two’, presumably derived from a BPM. The Wayan example also appears to be a BPM-derived
compound, but here ‘two’ is replaced by ‘entangled (with weeds)’.

If by inference the POc body part in this context was _*lalom_ ‘insides’ (§9.4), then the POc
BPM _*lalo- rua-rua_ is a plausible reconstruction.

   In a few languages a reduplicated reflex of POc _*rua_ ‘two’ with the sense ‘twofold’ serves
alone as ‘of two minds’.

  Fij:    Rotuman          ararua             [twofold] ‘(habitually) indecisive’

Occasionally the BPM turns up with ‘many’ instead of ‘two’, indicating that in some languages at
least the metaphor remained productive.

10.9 Agreeing, being of one mind

   Metaphors for ‘agree, reach consensus, be unanimous’ fall into two patterns. The first
roughly translates ‘be of one mind’. Its POc form may well have been parallel to that of POc
_*lalo- rua-rua_ ‘be of two minds’ (§10.8), but its reconstruction is obstructed by the fact that
several POc forms for ‘one’ can be reconstructed (Lynch, Ross & Crowley 2002:72), and their
distribution is not yet well enough understood to infer which form probably occurred in this
BPM.

Choosing is a cognitive act, but it is one that has visible physical consequences, and it is
perhaps for this reason that a POc etymon, _*piliq_ (VI), _*piliq-i-_ (VT) ‘choose, select, pick out’ ,
has enjoyed considerable continuity and relatively little replacement.

10.11 Learning and teaching

   To teach someone something is to cause them to learn it, and the learner then either knows
what has been taught or knows how to do something. This causative relationship is explicit in
many Oceanic languages. Occasionally it is expressed simply by using the same transitive
verb for learning something and teaching something, as in the instances below:

__formgroup__
  SES: Tolo          sasani-      ‘learn, educate, instruct’ (cf. _sasani_ (VI) ‘learn, go to school’)
  SES: To’aba’ita    toʔo-        ‘learn s.t.; teach s.o. s.t.’
  Fij: Wayan         vuli-ði-     ‘study, learn s.t., teach s.o.’ (_vuli_ (VI) ‘study, learn’)
  Pn:  Samoan        aʔo          ‘learn, teach, train’

More often (Table 28) it is expressed by attaching a causative prefix, usually a reflex of POc
_*pa[ka]-_ CAUSATIVE, to a root meaning ‘know’ (§10.2) or ‘learn’. Since to learn is often
synonymous with ‘come to know’, the English distinction between ‘know’ and ‘learn’ is not
relevant in this context.

    The Bariai (NNG), Misima (PT) and Halia (MM) items above, along with Dawawa (PT)
_wai-kata-i_ ‘show’, suggest that there was a PWOc causative _*paka-qataq-i-_ ‘teach, cause to
know, show’, formed from _*qataq-i-_ ‘know, understand, realise (that)’ (§10.2).

    Another semantic dimension of verbs of learning and teaching arises out of teaching styles
in traditional Oceanic communities. A young person learned how to do something by
watching an older person and imitating them, and this is reflected in the fact that POc _*towa_
‘imitate, learn by imitation’ and POc _*usuri_/_*usawiri_ ‘imitate’ below both have ‘imitate’ as
their primary sense. The causatives formed from them, however, mean ‘teach, instruct’,
presumably by demonstration.

    Lou, Baluan and Manam reflexes of intransitive POc _*towa_ ‘imitate, learn by imitation’
reflect a transitive _*towa-(a)kini-_ ‘learn (s.t.) by imitation’ formed with the suffix _*-(a)kini_
(§1.3.5.2). Curiously, PT reflexes of *towa are formed with a causative prefix, but mean ‘imitate’
rather than ‘teach’.

   At first sight, the set below appears to reflect the POc root _*usuri_, but the Ramoaaina and
Nehan reflexes suggest that formal reconstruction is more complicated. The Nehan root _sairi_
contains no internal _-u-_. The fact that NW Solomonic languages lose _-w-_. but not _-u-_, suggests
that _sairi_ reflects _usawiri_ (with unpredicted loss of initial _u-_). Ramoaaina loses _-s-_, and its
expected reflex of _*usuri_ would be †_ūr_, rather than actual wer, which also attests to the presence
of _*-w-_ followed by an unrounded vowel.

   The primary meaning of POc _*[ña]ñau_ appears to have been ‘teach’, perhaps centring on
parents or seniors instructing children orally about their responsibilities (cf Lukep, Sursurunga
and Kwaio glosses) and/or showing them how to perform traditional practices (cf Gela and Lau
glosses).

566 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


    The form of _*[ña]ñau_ is open to question. If the Nyindrou term is indeed a reflex, then the
POc consonant was _*ñ_. But if the Nyindrou term is not a reflex, and the Titan term listed under
‘cf. also’ is a proper reflex, then the form was _*[na]nau_.

10.12 Conclusion

For many cognition frames no POc term can be reconstructed. Apparently because their meanings
are abstract, their lexical replacement rate is considerably higher than for items with less
abstract meanings (§9.6). As we have noted, abstract states and activities tend to be encoded
metaphorically as complex lexemes.

   At the same time, it is reasonable to infer that, for example, the ‘think + find’ SVC pattern
for ‘remember’ in §10.5 is quite probably of POc antiquity, as it occurs in widely distributed
languages. However, the data do not allow us to reconstruct the forms that occurred in this and
other complex lexemes, and so the possibility of independent parallel innovation cannot be
excluded. Thus for remembering (§10.5), forgetting (§10.6) and being of one mind (§10.9) no
forms are reconstructed, but complex lexemes are described, as they give us some insight into
how POc speakers conceived these cognitive activities. For deciding (§10.7) not even a
consistent pattern of complex lexemes is found, and the same is true of hoping and expecting,
which are omitted here.



11 Describing people: stature, temperament, emotion and evaluation

11.1 Introduction

This chapter collects together terms that people use to describe each other and to express their
own feelings. It includes terms used to describe

__block__
- a person’s physical qualities (§11.2): tall vs short, big vs small, fat vs thin and strong vs
 weak ;
- a person’s temperament (§11.3): tame vs untamed, brave vs cowardly, obstinate, ignorant
 vs wise and stupid vs intelligent;
- a person’s emotions (§11.4): afraid, ashamed, compassionate, happy, sad, angry, confused,
 surprised;
- wanting (§11.5);
- one’s evaluation of someone or something as good or bad (§11.6).

This is quite a mixed bag, both semantically and formally. Terms of temperament, emotion and
wanting normally describe only human beings and sometimes higher animals, but terms used
to describe physical qualities or to express an evaluation are applied to a wider range of
referents that includes inanimates. Terms of temperament, emotion and wanting are quite often
BPMs, as they denote human affective states. The range of meanings found in the headings in
this chapter is somewhat restricted. For example, we tried to reconstruct terms for ‘lazy’ vs
‘hard-working’ and ‘generous’ vs ‘mean’, but could not do so because cognate sets are at best
very local. One reason for this is certainly that speakers are creative in their use of metaphor,
and so one term or metaphor is easily replaced by another. An associated reason is that many of
our sources do not record the complex lexemes that result from metaphorical usage. Although
BPMs occur for various aspects of wanting and desire, none are recorded in §11.5 because
there is little conceptual similarity among languages.

    Among the semantic fields in which BPMs are used, fewer are found in the description of
temperament than in the labelling of emotions. The reason for this is almost certainly that
temperament, like body shape (§11.2), is fairly stable through adulthood, and stable qualities
tend to be labelled by single words. Emotions and desires, on the other hand, are essentially
changeable, and are often described metaphorically. The boundary between temperament
terms and emotion terms, however, is fuzzy. Saying that someone is brave may refer to
someone’s temperament or to their current behaviour. In the latter case a BPM is expected, so
that a BPM like POc *qate- (p,pʷ)atu(k) [liver- strong/firm] ‘brave’ (§11.3.2.1) was basically an
expression used of someone’s immediate behaviour that was also extended to a stable
propensity of temperament.

11.2 Properties of the human body

11.2.1 Stature: tall vs short

Languages vary as to whether or not they lexicalise a distinction between horizontal and
vertical length. English does so by distinguishing between horizontal long and vertical tall, but
the antonym of both terms is short. German and French equate vertical length, at least in its
application to human beings, with size: German groβ, French grand ‘big, tall’ vs German klein,
French petit ‘small, short in stature’.

   Oceanic languages mostly agree in making no distinction between horizontal and vertical
length. The term for ‘long’ also means ‘tall’ and the term for ‘short’ has both horizontal and
vertical application. Both apply to the stature of human beings. The relevant terms are
reconstructed in vol.2 (pp197–199). In no Oceanic language for which data are available is
human stature equated with size (§11.2.2).

11.2.2 Size: big vs small

It follows from the last statement that terms with the general meaning ‘big’ (POc _*lapuat_) and
‘small’ (POc _*qitik_, _*riki(t,q)_), reconstructed in vol.2 (pp191–196), do not denote stature when
they refer to human beings. To assert that someone is ‘big’ is typically to say that this person
has social prestige, and this was probably also true in POc. The nature of that prestige depends
on community structure. In chiefly societies, a ‘big’ man is a chieftain.

In non-chiefly societies a ‘big’ man is an important person, perhaps by virtue of leadership
qualities, perhaps by virtue of accrued wealth.

   A secondary but much less frequent association of ‘big’ is with age: ‘big’ equates with
‘older’.

   ‘Small’ in Oceanic languages is the antonym of ‘big’ with regard to size, but not in its
extended meanings. The expected antonym of ‘chiefly, important’ would be ‘socially inferior’,
but this usage appears to be very rare. Instead, ‘small’ seems far more frequently used of a
child, that is, with regard to age. However, it is difficult to be sure about this, because a gloss
like ‘young, small’ does not tell us that the word is used for small objects in general, as the
translator may simply have ‘young child, small child’ in mind.

11.2.3 Girth: fat vs thin

Oceanic languages typically distinguish between (a) the girth (circumferential thickness) of
both human beings (English _fat_ or _stout_) and non-human objects (e.g. _a thick stem_) and (b) the
thickness of something with a flat surface, like paper, or the depth of a large body of water.

    Two terms reconstructed for ‘thick’ in vol.2 (pp201–202) concern us here, POc _*ma-tolu_
and POc _*[tubu]tubu[ka]_. Glosses that disambiguate the meaning of _*ma-tolu_ point in just
one instance (Manam) to girth and in a majority of cases to the thickness of something flat,
and it is reasonable to infer that this was its central POc sense.

    The term reconstructed for ‘thin’ in vol.2 (pp202–203) is POc _*manipis_. Below are listed
reflexes with disambiguating glosses, and it is clear that _*manipis_ is the antonym of _*matolu_
‘thick (of flat objects)’ and thus not a term applied to human beings.

   The data make it clear that Oceanic languages have a distinct term or terms for people who
are thin/scawny/skinny, but no cognate set reflecting a POc term with this meaning has been
reconstructed. Clark (2009) reconstructs a PNCV term that evidently had this sense.

11.2.4 Strength: strong vs weak

Oceanic terms for ‘strong’ tend also to mean ‘hard’. One POc term for ‘strong, hard’ was
_*toRas_, reconstructed in vol.3 (pp200–201) with the sense ‘a taxon of hardwood trees including
Intsia bijuga’, where it is also noted that the POc term meant ‘hard, durable’. There is no
evidence, though, that this term denoted human strength.

     The three terms below, POc _*kayu-kayu_, Proto Remote Oceanic _*[kayu]kayu-a_ and PEOc _*kaila_ ‘strong,
firm’ appear to be derived from the generic term for tree, POc _*kayu_ (vol.3:71–73), used
metaphorically for strength and hardness. However, this seemingly obvious derivation is a
little problematic. If the reflexes of these three terms are compared with the terms for tree in
the same languages, differences emerge. The _*kayu_-like terms for ‘strong, firm’ have a fortis
initial _k-_, whilst in languages that have a fortis/lenis distinction[2] the term for ‘tree’ has a lenis
initial _ɣ-_ (Bugotu, W Guadalcanal, Woleaian) or zero (Labu, Paamese). This appears to be
evidence against the hypothesis that these terms are derived from _*kayu_. However, the history
of the fortis/lenis distinction is not well understood, and in favour of the hypothesis is that POc
_*kayu-kayu_ and _*[kayu]kayu-a_ were both formed from _*kayu_ by two early Oceanic adjective-forming
strategies. The first was CVCV- reduplication, giving POc _*kayu-kayu_ ‘strong, tough,
inflexible’ (vol.2:206–220). The second was the addition of _*-[k]a_ to a noun (Ross 2000),
giving _*[kayu]kayu-a_. The fortis/lenis and other formal discrepancies can perhaps be
explained by assuming that speakers’ association of ‘strong, firm’ with ‘tree’ was lost in some
languages, and as a result the root of the ‘strong’ term and the reflex of _*kayu_ have undergone
different phonological developments.

     PEOc _*kaila_ ‘strong, firm’ has a similar set of meanings, and was presumably also derived
from _*kayu_, but the derivational mechanism has not been recorded in other terms.

   Weak has at least two related senses in English when it is applied to human beings:
‘temporarily weak as a result of tiredness, sickness or hunger’ and ‘constitutionally weak’. It is
the latter which relevant here. Just as ‘strong’ is associated with ‘hard’ in Oceanic languages,
so ‘weak’ is associated with ’soft’. POc _*[ma]lumu_ ‘soft, gentle, easy’ is reconstructed in vol.2
(p215). In its application to people, this term seems to have had two senses: with reference to
the body, ‘constitutionally weak’, and with reference to temperament ‘gentle,
easygoing’ (§11.3.1.1). In the listing below ‘weak’ is shown in bold when it occurs in a gloss.

11.3 Properties of the human temperament

Whilst Oceanic languages certainly have terms, some of them BPMs, for human propensities,
many of these terms may refer to both temporary and permanent states. It is the permanent
states that are properties of temperament, and some languages have a construction that encodes
these. There is, however, no POc construction that can be reconstructed with this function.

    Iduna, like a number of other Papuan Tip languages, makes copious use of _to-_ ‘person
who…’ (from POc _*tau-_; §2.2.1.2) in expressions like the following, where the item
compounded with _to-_, typically a verb, encodes a quality construed as permanent.

__formgroup__
 PT: Iduna  to-selakalaka   ‘boaster, arrogant person’ (_-selakalaka_ ‘boast, brag, be proud’)
 PT: Iduna  to-siveyawa     ‘healer’ (_siveyawa_ ‘healing’)
 PT: Iduna  to-taɣa-kʷeu    ‘deaf person’ (_taɣa_ ‘ear’; _-kʷeu_ ??)
 PT: Iduna  to-talahaɣi     ‘person at enmity with s.o., not speaking to, eating with or visiting them’ (_-talahaɣi_ ‘repudiate, hate, have nothing to do with s.o.’)
 PT: Iduna  to-tubukoyo     ‘cripple’ (_-tubukoyo_ ‘develop badly, not grow well’)
 PT: Iduna  to-tunutunuɣina ‘upright, honest person’ (_tunutunuɣina_ ‘straight, upright, righteous, honest’)
 PT: Iduna to-nu-beʔu-beʔu ‘lame person’ (_beʔu_ ‘fall down’)

In a number of these compounds the stem is itself a BPM formed with nua ‘think; mind’.

__formgroup__
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-doɣa     ‘kind, generous person’ (_nuanua-wadoɣa-na_ ‘gracious, generous’)
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-hobu     ‘humble person’ (_-nua-hobu_ ‘be humble’; _-hobu_ ‘go down’)

 PT: Iduna  to-nua-kabubu ‘kind, loving person’ (_nua-kabubu_ ‘love, blessing, favour’)
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-lolona   ‘miser, ungenerous person’ (_-nua-lolona_ ‘withhold (food, possessions)’)
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-luɣa     ‘double-minded person’ (_-nua-luɣa_ ‘indecisive’; §10.8)
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-sivebala ‘agitator’ (_-sivebalana_ ‘deter, prevent from going or doing, hold back’)
 PT: Iduna  to-nua-vita     ‘downcast, depressed person’ (_-vita_ ‘heavy’)

   Motu (PT) forms compound lexemes in a semantically parallel manner, but the attribute
precedes _tau-na_, composed of _tau_ ‘person’ and _-na_ ‘its’. The attribute takes the prefix _he-_,
indicating a state, condition or habit. _he-abidae tau-na_ ‘a hospitable man’ (_he-abidae_ ‘show
hospitality’)

__formgroup__
 PT: Motu  |he-aɣi tau-na|     ‘a braggart, conceited man’ (_he-aɣi_ ‘boast’)
 PT: Motu  |he-ani tau-na|     ‘a cannibal’ (_ani_ ‘eat’)
 PT: Motu  |he-atotau tau-na| ‘one who pays another to betray, kill or save another’ (_he-atotau_ ‘be held down by s.t. placed on top’)
 PT: Motu  |he-boɣahisi tau-na| ‘a compassionate, merciful person’ (he-boɣa-hisi [he-belly-pain] ‘pity, compassion’)
 PT: Motu  |he-ɣame tau-na| ‘beggar’ (_heɣame_ ‘beg’)

    Although constructions reflecting POc _*tau-_ ‘person who’ are widespread among Papuan
Tip languages, there is little evidence that the construction was used for properties of
temperament in POc. Instead, as noted in §2.2.1.2, the POc construction was used to denote
people with skill in a particular occupation and sometimes people of a certain place or clan. A
check of reflexes in Mussau (Adm), Nakanai and Teop (MM), Woleaian and Carolinian (Mic)
and various Polynesian languages suggests that the extension of the construction to denote
temperamental qualities was restricted to PT.

    Several languages have a noun that is used with the sense ‘disposition, way of acting, habit’
and is modified by an adjective or stative verb to form a complex lexeme denoting a property
of temperament.

    Seimat (Adm) has such a term, _oŋa_ ‘temperament or disposition’.

__formgroup__
 Adm: Seimat  |oŋa- solia-n|       [disposition good] ‘amiable’
 Adm: Seimat  |oŋa- kalimen|       [disposition bad, terrible, dreadful] ‘greedy, self-centred, miserly, infamous, inhospitable’
 Adm: Seimat  |oŋa- ewii   |       [disposition nice, calm] ‘benevolent, generous, hospitable’
 Adm: Seimat  |oŋa- lialun |       [disposition bad] ‘inhospitable’

   Tongan _aŋa_ reflects the PPn term _*aŋa_ with widespread reflexes outside eastern Polynesia
that are used in this way. Its resemblance to Seimat _oŋa_ may be a matter of chance. Tongan in
particular has hundreds of complex lexemes formed with _aŋa_ ‘character, habit, nature’. A
brief selection is given:

    In Tongan _aŋa_ stands in contrast with _loto_ ‘insides’ (< PPn _*loto_; vol.2:239). Where _aŋa_
denotes a permanent feature of temperament, e.g. _aŋa fiemālie_ ‘of contented and easy-going
disposition’, loto denotes a transient emotion, e.g. _loto fiemālie_ ‘contented, satisfied’.

    In Wayan Fijian _alo-_ ‘soul’ is similarly used for temperamental features as shown in the
following examples, whilst the corresponding transient emotions are denoted by simple
adjectives.

__formgroup__
 Fij: Wayan  alo-kasa      ‘quick to learn, intelligent, having an absorbent mind’ (_kasa_ ‘learned’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-kaikai, alo-qwāqwā ‘determined, strong-willed, brave, stubborn, aggressive’ (_kaikai_, _qwāqwā_ ‘strong’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-malumalum ‘gentle, good-tempered, of quiet disposition’ (_malumalum_ ‘soft, ripe’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-sewasewa  ‘frightened, intimidated, lacking courage’ (_sewasewa_ ‘tiny’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-vinā      ‘kind, kind-hearted’ (_vinā_ ‘good’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-vou       ‘young in spirit, young at heart’ (_vou_ ‘new, fresh’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-wai       ‘moody, subject to changes in mood’ (_wai_ ‘water’)
 Fij: Wayan  alo-vaka-tāŋʷane ‘manly, courageous’ (_vaka-tāŋʷane_ ‘like a man’)

    Similar expressions occur in Bauan Fijian with the cognate term _yalo-_ ‘soul, spirit,
disposition’, e.g. _yalo mālua_ ‘meek, lowly’ (_mālua_ ‘quiet, gentle’), _yalo vinaka_
‘kind-hearted’ (_vinaka_ ‘good’).

    The examples collected from Iduna, Motu, Seimat, Fijian and Tongan show how each of
these languages has devised a way to describe temperamental qualities, using a modifier with
either a term like Tongan _aŋa_ ‘character, habit, nature’ or a reflex of the POc construction with
_*tau…_ ‘person who’.

    Modifiers that describe features of temperament are reconstructed in the sections below,
but this appears to be an unstable semantic field, presumably because of the tendency to invent
new metaphors to describe behaviour and temperament. As a result, few terms are
reconstructable.

11.3.1 Tame vs untamed

11.3.1.1 Tame, accustomed to

POc evidently inherited a pair of terms meaning ‘tame, docile, trained, well behaved’ that were
applied both to animals and human beings. The pair were _*laca(m)_ and _*ma-naca(m)_. Pairs of
property terms with the same root were apparently quite common in POc, one unprefixed, the
other with either _*ka-_ or _*ma-_, prefixes that often occur on stative verbs, both originating in the
stative prefix _*ka-_ (Zeitoun & Huang 2000:298). The seeming oddity about this pair is that the
POc bare root had initial _*l-_. the prefixed root initial _*n-_. However, this is readily accounted for
if the PAn root had initial _*L-_,[4] which regularly became PMP _*l-_ initially but _*-n-_ medially.
Thus PAn _*Lajam_ became PMP _*lajam_ and POc _*laca(m)_, whilst PAn _*ma-Lajam_ regularly
became PMP _*ma-najam_ and POc _*ma-naca(m)_.

   POc _*ma-naca(m)_ underwent an extension in meaning whereby ‘trained’ became
‘knowledgeable’ and then ‘know, understand, think about’, and as a nominal ‘knowledge,
understanding, mind’. This extension is discussed in §10.3. Reflexes below are restricted to
the ‘tame’ etc senses.

[4] The root was reconstructed _*Lajam_ in an earlier version of the ACD. It now appears as _*najam_, but the
    Oceanic evidence evidence points to _*Lajam_, which is favoured by most Formosan reflexes (Tsou,
    Saaroa, Favorlang, Bunun, Kavalan) but not by Puyuma _ma-nadam_ (_-n-_ for †_-l-_) or Amis _ma-nanam_
    (_-n-_ for †_-d-_). Assimilation is a possible factor in the latter case. Philippine reflexes of the
    bare root have _n-_ for †_l-_. These may reflect a mack-formation from PMP _*ma-najam_.

                                                                      Describing people 577

    It is tempting to try to relate the items below to _*ma-nacam_ above, but they evidently
reflect a different (PWOc) etymon.

 MM: Roviana    manavasa          ‘tame, subdued, at home, be used to’

   It is reasonably clear from the glosses of the sets above that these terms referred to a
temperamental quality for which there is no single English term. It describes a person who is
domesticated, gentle and quietly spoken, and content with their lot. This quality was
apparently positively valued. If it were otherwise, the glosses would almost certainly register
the negativity.

   POc _*[ma]lumu_ ‘soft (of objects); gentle, easygoing; (constitutionally) weak’,
reconstructed in vol.2 (p215) as a property of inanimate objects, is applied in various Oceanic
languages to the human temperament with a sense resembling that of the items above, and this
extension may well have occurred in POc. It was evidently also applied to the body in the
sense of ‘constitutionally weak’, and the cognate set is listed in §11.2.4.

   There is also evidence of a BPM containing this term.

11.3.1.2 Untamed, wild

   As POc reconstructions for ‘tame, accustomed to’ refer to a kind of domesticated
amiability, so terms glossed ‘wild’ similarly refer to the behaviour often associated with
undomesticated animals, i.e. ‘savage’, ‘fierce’. In places, terms may also be applied to
the rainforest and to normally cultivated plants that have self-sown outside the gardens.
While terms for ‘tame’ are also used to denote a human temperamental quality, it is less
clear that this is true of POc _*wasi_.

11.3.2 Brave vs cowardly

11.3.2.1 Brave, courageous

Bravery is commonly expressed as a body-part metaphor (BPM) based on the liver or belly,
with a modifying term apparently reflecting POc _*[(p,pʷ)atu](p,pʷ)atu_ ‘hard, strong, firm’, the latter
derived from _*(p,pʷ)atu(k)_ ‘outer shell, skull’ (§3.4.2). Hence we can tentatively reconstruct a POc
BPM _*qate- (p,pʷ)atu_ [liver- hard/strong] ‘brave’. In the languages of the set below, reflexes of
_*(p,pʷ)atu_ also function as a stative verb ‘firm, strong’. Reflexes of _(p,pʷ)atu_ are formally and
semantically similar to _*patu_ ‘stone’ (vol.2:62), but in POc were distinct from it (§3.4.2.1). In
Kwaio, however, which does not have a reflex of _*(p,pʷ)atu_, the fou of lae-fou ‘brave’ is the term
for ‘stone’. One may infer that the Kwaio term is a reflex of _*qate- (p,pʷ)atu_ which with the loss
of a reflex of _*(p,pʷ)atu_ has been reinterpreted as if it reflected _*qate- patu_ [liver- stone].
Something similar has occurred in Gumawana and Iduna, where the modifying term taken
alone has a meaning other than ‘firm, strong’.

                                                                        Describing people 579

   Why not infer that _*patu_ ‘stone’ occurred in the POc term and that all BPMs below reflect
_*qate- patu_? Because POc _*patu_ ‘stone’ would be reflected as Gumawana †_vatu_, Dobu †_atu_,
Bunama †_hatu_, but these terms do not occur at all (Gela _vatu_ ‘stone’ does occur). The
morpheme _patu_ in their BPMs thus probably reflects _(p,pʷ)atu_ (cf. Dobu _patu_ (VI) ‘harden, set’).

   We have three reflexes of the BPM _*qate- lapuat_ [liver big]. Oddly, this metaphor has the
reverse meaning of that proposed by Blust for PMP where [big liver] stands for ‘brave, proud,
arrogant’ (see §9.6).

  Fij:   Wayan       |ate levu|       [liver large] ‘cowardly’

   Marshallese has eccelok acin [without liver] ‘he is not brave’.

11.3.3 Obstinate, stubborn

A rather widespread BPM for ‘obstinate, stubborn’ has a modifier of the same meaning as the
BPM for ‘brave, courageous’ (§11.3.2.1) namely ‘strong/firm’, but a different body-part. POc
_*qate-_ ‘liver’ was evidently used in the BPM for ‘brave’. The evidence of Admiralties and
NCV languages below suggests that _*qate-_ was replaced by _*bʷatu(k)_ ‘head’ (§3.4.2) in the
BPM for ‘obstinate’. This may be a further illustration of the hypothesis that more physically
expressed qualities such as ‘brave’ form a BPM with _*qate-_, while mental states do not (§9.4).
Instead of _*lalo-_, however, in this case the more specific _*bʷatu(k)_ occurs. Clark (2009)
reconstructs a BPM here, PNCV _*bʷatu kayua_ [head strong] ‘wilful, stubborn’, reflected by the
Big Nambas and Paamese terms below.

11.3.4 Ignorant vs wise and stupid vs intelligent

11.3.4.1 Ignorant, stupid

In Eastern Oceanic languages ignorance is sometimes expressed by a BPM [mind dark], a
complex lexeme that also means ‘forget’ in some EOc languages (§10.6). In some languages
this BPM has both senses. Again, the terms for ‘night’ reflect either POc *rodrom ‘be dark, be
night’ or POc _*boŋi_ ‘night’ (vol.2:295–298).

__formgroup__

  Mic: Kiribati             nano-ro             [insides dark] ‘ignorant, uncultured’

Sometimes a verb ‘be dark’ is used alone as a metaphor for ‘ignorant’.

__formgroup__
  SES: To’aba’ita     rō-rodoʔa     ‘be dark (of a place); be ignorant about (of a person)’ (_rodo_ ‘night, be dark’)
  Fij: Wayan          ŋīŋīlō        ‘dull, poor in light; get dark; be dusk, nightfall; ignorant, lacking in knowledge or wisdom’

    Oceanic languages tend to have a term which means ‘mentally impaired’ and translates,
depending on context, as ‘ignorant’, ‘stupid’, ‘foolish, silly’ or ‘mad, crazy, insane’. They
reflect a number of POc terms which must have different shades of meaning that are now lost
to us.

    POc _*kila_ has only one Oceanic reflex, and it is a reasonable inference that it disappeared
early across much of Oceanic because the merger of PMP _*g_ and _*k_ rendered Oceanic
reflexes similar to those of POc (VI) _*kilala_ ‘know’, from PMP _*kilala_, with the opposite
meaning.

   The presence of reflexes of POc _*[ŋa(q)u]ŋa(q)uŋ_ ‘stupid, ignorant’ in an Admiralties
language and a few NNG languages warrants its reconstruction. Possible medial _*-q-_ is
shown, as it allows the reconstructed form to accord with POc canonic structure, and would
have been lost in each of these reflexes.

11.3.4.2 Wise, intelligent

Despite the fact that Oceanic languages typically have a term meaning ‘intelligent, clever, wise,
understanding’, it has proven impossible to reconstruct a corresponding POc term.

   Occasionally a BPM [mind daylight] occurs, the antonym of [mind night]
‘ignorant’ (§11.3.4), and it is possible that there was a PNCV BPM of the form _*lolo- marani_
[insides daylight] ‘clever, intelligent’ (reflecting POc _*ma-raqani_ ‘be(come) light’, vol.2:318–219).

  NCV: Lonwolwol       |lo- merɛn  |    [mind- daylight] ‘clever’

11.4 Emotion expressions

As discussed in chapter 9, emotions are typically described as emanating either from the liver
(POc _*qate_), as seat of emotions and thoughts, or from a quasi-body part, POc _*lalo-_, _*lalom_
‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’, but other body parts sometimes occur in their place.
Particular feelings are expressed as a BPM that specifies the nature of the feeling.

   Although a degree of common conceptual patterns can be identified in BPMs for broadly
identified emotions like happiness, sadness and anger, no reconstructions are made.

   Languages closer to New Guinea seem to make the greatest use of BPMs for emotions, and
languages further east use them less, petering out almost entirely in Polynesia, where the
body-part component of the BPM tends to be lost and the modifying component tends to
become an adjective in its own right (§3.4, §3.5, §3.8).

584 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   A small number of broadly identified emotion terms have been reconstructed as single
lexemes, and we turn to these first.

11.4.1 Afraid

Although a language will typically use numerous metaphors to describe different degrees or
kinds of fear, languages from all major subgroups have reflexes of POc _*matakut_, probably
indicating that it was the term most general in meaning. Both an intransitive and a transitive
form are reconstructable. The intransitive form, *matakut, is widely reflected. The transitive
form, _*matakut-i-_, has fewer reflexes, and it is possible that it reflects parallel innovations in
various Oceanic languages. The reason for this inference is that the prefix _*ma-_ is a stative
formative that was originally incompatible with the transitive marker _*-i-_.

11.4.2 Ashamed, embarrassed, shy

The next term is remarkable among emotion terms in being reconstructable right back to
PAn with very high consistency of meaning. The emotion, for which there is no single
equivalent English term, is valued as an instrument of social control, most effective in
small communities. As described by Charles Valentine with reference to Nakanai
speakers,

__blockquote__
    The feeling is described as a kind of acute embarrassment which is occasioned by public
    exposure, violation of modesty, recognition of deception, social exclusion, and certain other
    forms of interaction in which the subject feels threatened by the inappropriateness of his
    relations with others. (Valentine 1963:445)

11.4.3 Love, be compassionate, be sorry for, have pity, sympathise

The English term love is polysemous, with one meaning, ‘romantic love’, given an importance
in Western societies that is not generally paralleled elsewhere. In Tahitian _maʔa-maʔa_ is
translated by Levy as

__blockquote__
      to be crazy, bizarre (incl. being romantically in love). This is considered somewhat bad and
      abnormal. (1973:305)

Across Oceanic languages, terms for ‘to be lovers’[5] are distinct from terms that denote caring
about someone, and terms used to refer to the latter include an emotion akin to compassion.
This semantic frame is labelled SORRY here, in recognition of the fact that the word _sore_
encodes this frame in both Papua New Guinea Tok Pisin and Vanuatu Bislama. Motu
_hebogahisi_ ‘pity, compassion’ is instructive, combining _boga_ ‘belly, seat of desire and affection’
with _hisi_ ‘pain’. Other glosses combining what in English are distinct emotions include
Gedaged _ilo- pani_ [inside- give] ‘sympathise with, love, pity, yearn for, feel for, commiserate
with, mourn for, be homesick for s.o., s.t.’; Tolai _māri_ ‘to love, pity, have compassion for’,
Roviana _tataru_ ‘to pity, love’, To’aba’ita _tatakomia_ ‘have a feeling of deep affection for s.o.,
s.t., such as sorrow, pity, compassion, mercy, love or admiration’, Arosi _tabai_ ‘to love, pity’,
Rotuman _ruu_ ‘to love, value, care greatly for, feel solicitude’. English speakers, on the other
hand, are more likely to include ‘love’ as an extension of ‘like’, ‘admire’ and a range of terms
for ‘desire’.

[5] These terms are typically associated with a set of terms to do with love magic.

   As noted in §10.3, the SORRY frame is one of the meanings of widely distributed reflexes of
POc (VI) _*drodrom_, (VT) _*drom-i_ ‘think, worry; love, be sorry for, long for’. A dedicated
SORRY verb, POc _*qarop_, _*qarop-i-_ ‘feel pity, empathy, be sorry for’,[6] was inherited from PMP
but is reflected only in SES and Pn languages. The Arosi reflex and all Pn reflexes reflect an
apparent PEOc _*qarop-a_. The suffix _*-a_ probably reflects the POc nominaliser _*an_.

   Two further cognate sets, each with few reflexes, permit the reconstruction of SORRY
morphemes. The first, POc _*dolom_, is restricted to NWS and SES languages and may
represent local innovations, but Nehan is the northernmost NWS language, so it is unlikely
that the set is due to borrowing. It is likely that *dolom was a noun, as the Gela and Longgu
transitives in _-vi_ (for †_dolom-i-_) appear to reflect a Proto Southeast Solomonic formation.

<
POc *dolom (N?) ‘love, pity, sorrow, compassion’
 MM:  Nehan         dolomo            (N) ‘sorrow’

 SES: Longgu        dolo-vi           (VT) ‘love someone’
>

[6] Homophony with POc _*qarop_ ‘face’ (N LOC) ‘front, the side usually seen’ (vol.2:247) is due to chance,
    as _*qarop_ ‘face’ reflects PMP _*qadep_ ‘facade, front’, but _*qarop_ ‘feel pity …’ reflects PMP _*qarep_.

    A number of languages have BPMs for the SORRY meaning, but their components usually
differ from language to language. Examples include:

__formgroup__
  Adm: Nyindrou    |ade- hadru in ta-| [liver- true in OBL-] ‘love, cherish, adore’
  NNG: Gedaged     |ilo- i-pani-     | [insides- it-give-] ‘sympathise with, love, pity, commiserate with, mourn for, long for’
  NNG: Takia       |bube- i-pani-    | [liver- it-give-] ‘love’
  PT:  Bunama      ʔate-muya-muya [liver-pain-pain] ‘pity, compassion’

In many of these BPMs, however, the modifying component has no meaning independent of
the BPM in which it occurs.

11.4.4 Happy

BPMs for ‘happy’, ‘cheerful’, ‘joyful’, ‘glad’, ‘carefree’ often have ‘good’ as their modifying
component. This is sometimes a reflex of POc _*puia_ ‘good’ or PEOc _*leka_ ‘good,
pleasant’ (§11.6.1).

    While some Pn languages use a BPM with _fiafia_ ‘happy’ as its modifying element, many
of them use _fiafia_ alone, as in the set below.

   It is just possible that POc had a single word, _*puiawa-_, for ‘happiness’ (or ‘happy’),
apparently derived from _*puia_ ‘good’ (§11.6.1). However, this derivation involves positing an
otherwise unknown morpheme _*-wa-_, and possible reflexes are few.

11.4.5 Sad

No simple lexeme can be reconstructed for ‘sad’. Instead. many Oceanic languages use a BPM
for ‘sad’, and related meanings like ‘depressed’, ‘miserable’ and ‘unhappy’, and here there are
some consistent patterns. One pattern combines ‘insides’ or ‘mind’ with a term meaning
‘heavy’. The fact that no _*qate-_ terms have been collected for ‘sad’-like emotions is possibly
because these are seen as passive, non-violent. As Bugenhagen (2001:96) has argued for
Mangap, _*qate-_ terms occur most often with rash, impetuous emotions.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Yabem               |ŋalɪlʊm wapaʔ   | [insides heavy] ‘his heart is heavy, full of sorrow, dispirited’

  PT:  Motu                 lalo-metau        [insides-heavy] ‘unwilling’
  PT:  Dobu                |nua- i-mʷau     | [mind- it-heavy] ‘downhearted’

  SES: To’aba’ita          |manata- e kuluʔa| [mind- it heavy] ‘unhappy’
  Fij:    Bauan             loma-bībī            [insides heavy, difficult, painful] ‘sad’

   The Polynesian terms typically use a modifier reflecting POc *mapat ‘heavy’ (vol.2:213),
without body part.

__formgroup__
  Pn:     Tongan            mafas-i-a            ‘be weighed down, burdened, literally or figuratively’
  Pn:     Samoan            mafat-i-a            ‘be hurt, affected, physically and mentally tired’
  Pn:     Tahitian          fātaī                ‘to be depressed, yield to discouragement’

   Terms for ‘sad’ often overlap with those for ‘angry’ (§3.6). A second pattern uses ‘insides’
+ ‘bad’ for ‘sad’ and a range of ‘feeling bad’ emotions that includes sadness and anger. In
some cases the ‘bad’ word is a reflex of POc _*saqat_ ‘bad’ (§11.6.2):

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia                ilo-saian            [insides bad] ‘sorrowful, angry, sad, feel badly’
  NNG: Mutu                 |lolo i-saɣat|         [insides it-bad] ‘sad, upset’
  SES: Longgu               |taʔa kutu|            [bad belly] ‘be sad, anxious, worried, feel sorry’
  SES: ’Are’are             |rae- e taʔa|          [liver- it bad] ‘angry’

11.4.6 Angry

No reconstructions are proposed. Languages typically have a number of terms for various kinds
of anger varying with the intensity of emotion and the construal of the triggering event. The
following BPMs are from Yabem (NNG):

__formgroup__
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ gɪôʔ auʔ    |    [belly.his grown.over PERF] ‘he is full of rage, cannot think clearly because of rage’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ kɪmʷatiŋ tau|    [belly.his knot itself] ‘he is burning with rage; is angry, irritated’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ kɪpʷa       |    [belly.his explode] ‘his blood is up, swells with rage’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ kɪbuli auʔ  |    [belly.his twisted PERF]‘'his heart is enraged, irritated, takes offence at s.t., feels scandalised by s.t.’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ ŋamakiʔ     |    [belly.his bitter] ‘he is angry, bitter, irritated’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ ŋandaŋ      |    [belly.his hot] ‘he is furious’
 NNG: Yabem   |tɪtaʔ seʔ         |    [belly.his bad] ‘he is discontented, displeased, angry, dismal, sad’

    Anger often overlaps with sadness insofar as BPMs of the pattern ‘insides’ + ‘bad’ and
‘insides’ + ‘painful’ mean either ‘angry’ or ‘sad’ or both. Examples are given in §11.4.5.

    The examples below, although ranging in meaning from ‘cross’ to ‘indignant’ to ‘furious’,
all contain metaphors that relate to heat or fire or its consequences.

Terms from three languages support a PEOc reconstruction:

  Pn:   Maori            rore                 ‘intoxicated; entangle’

   Some languages, like Maori above, express mental confusion by describing the mind as
tangled (as of vegetation), while two SES languages below describe the mind as closed or
blocked:

__formgroup__

11.4.8 Surprised

Not unexpectedly a number of terms for ‘surprised’ are perceived as associated with fear and
used also for ‘alarmed’ or ‘shocked’. In both the Pn and Mic cognate sets given below there is
also an association with being woken suddenly.

   A recurrent metaphor incorporates words for jumping or flying using reflexes of POc

11.5 Desiring and wanting

We have included desire and wanting in this chapter because in some contexts (being envious,
homesick) it has a strong emotional basis.[7] In others, of course—lacking food (§§4.3.3.1–2) or
sleep (§4.6.2), sexual desire (§4.2.2.2)—it denotes a physical rather than emotional need.

    The most striking result of our searches for ways in which POc speakers expressed ‘want’
and ‘desire’ is the absence of any consistency of expression in modern languages outside the
Central Pacific (Fij + Pn) group. A major reason for this is that, as a result of the ubiquity and
frequency of ‘want’ in the world’s languages, ‘want’ words tend strongly to undergo
grammaticisation and to end up as particles in the slots otherwise reserved for tense, aspect
and especially mood markers. The endpoint of this tendency is that the ‘want’ morpheme
undergoes extension of function and becomes a future or irrealis morpheme, accompanied by
the innovation of new ways of expressing ‘want’. Thus in Takia (NNG) the ‘want’ morpheme
is the enclitic _*=[w]o_, which occupies the first of a series of postverbal enclitic slots (Ross
2008) that are otherwise occupied by aspect or mood morphemes:

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia  ŋ-le=o [I-see=want] ‘I want to see’
  NNG: Takia  ŋ-le=da [I-see=imperfect] ‘I am seeing’
  NNG: Takia  ŋ-le=ya [I-see=realis] ‘I saw’
  NNG: Takia  ŋ-le=wa [I-see=irrealis] ‘I shall see’

In Longgu (SES) the ‘want’ morpheme is preverbal tali, in the same structural position as
certain aspectual morphemes and the negator (Hill 1992):

__formgroup__
  SES: Longgu  |tali inu|    [want drink] ‘(I) want to drink’
  SES: Longgu  |tazani tate| [just appear] ‘(I) have just appeared’
  SES: Longgu  |vusi aŋi|    [almost cry] ‘(I) am almost crying’
  SES: Longgu  |se lae|      [not go] ‘(I) am not going’

A number of languages of the Southeast Solomons, Fiji and Polynesia are like Longgu: they
have a pre-verbal particle or prefix meaning ‘want’, but the SES and Wayan Fijian forms show
no relation to each other, nor to PCP _*via_ below.

__formgroup__
   SES: ’Are’are   siri      ‘hanker after, long for, desire’ (_siri hana_ ‘very hungry’, _siri koʔu_ ‘thirsty’)
   SES: Arosi      gasi-     ‘to desire, desiderative prefix to any verb’ (_gasi-gono_ ‘thirsty’, _gasi-maura_ ‘sleepy’, _gasi-ŋau_ ‘hungry’)
   SES: Kwaio      māli-     ‘prefix’ (_māli-faŋa_ ‘hungry’ and _māli-goʔu_ ‘thirsty’)
   Fij: Wayan      mata      ‘preverbal particle, want, desire, feel need to do V’ (_mata kani_ ‘hungry’, _mata som_  ‘thirsty’, _mata moðe_ ‘sleepy’)

   As noted in §§4.3.3.1–2 and §4.6.2.1 Central Pacific languages express the concepts of
being hungry, thirsty and sleepy as sequences of ‘want to’ + verb:

__block__
  PCP _*via kani_ ‘be hungry’ (lit. ‘want eat’)
  PCP _*via inu_ ‘be thirsty’ (lit. ‘want drink’)
  PCP _*via moze_ ‘be sleepy’ (lit. ‘want sleep’)

   Since PCP _*via_ apparently reflects PMP _*pian_, the reconstruction of POc _*pia(n)_ can be
inferred. However, it seems to have been displaced in non-Central Pacific Oceanic languages
by a variety of lexical strategies.

   A range of languages use reflexes of POc _*mate_ ‘to die’ (§4.2.1.2) to express an intense
need, particularly for such things as food, water, or betelnut, paralleling the English
expressions ‘dying for a smoke’ etc.

__formgroup__
  NNG: Takia               |you=o -mat|       [water=for -die] ‘thirsty’
  NNG: Gedaged             -mat               ‘long, yearn, crave, desire, lust after’
  NNG: Poeng               mate-ka-           [die eat] ‘want food, be hungry’
  NNG: Kakuna              mate-kana          [die eat] ‘hungry’
  NNG: Uvol                mete-ana           [die eat] ‘hungry’
  SES: Lau                 |mae-li gwou|        [die-TR water] ‘long for a drink, be thirsty’
  SES: Kwaio               |mā-li faŋa|         [die-TR food] ‘long for food, be hungry’

   In a number of languages, desire is strongly identified with the reflex of POc _*lalo-_, _*lalom_
‘inside; seat of thoughts and emotions’ or whatever has replaced it as the term for
‘mind’ (§9.4). The following example from Bugenhagen’s Mangap-Mbula grammar
(1995:223) illustrates how this works (or in some languages, once worked):

                                                                                      Describing people 595

__igt__
         Nio lele-ŋ            be aŋ-la pa ᵐbeŋ8
         I      insides-my NF I-go at night
         ‘I wanted to go at night.’

A more literal translation is ‘My inside/thought/desire (was) that I would go at night.’ This
Kalokalo (PT) sentence has a similar structure (Guderian & Guderian 2002).

__igt__
     nuanua-gu ya-na-egimʷaneye-ya
     want-my        I-will-sell-it
     ‘I wanted to sell it.’

In some languages the ‘mind’ noun has been (half-)transformed into a verb, as in Lewo (NCV),
where the transitive verbal suffix _-ni_ is attached to the ‘mind’ noun _sine-_ ‘guts’ and its possessor
suffix, in this instance _-la_ ‘their’ (Early 1994a).

__igt__
       sine-la-ni        0-̷ sape Palua 0-̷ va                e wa
       guts-their-TR it-say Palua he-iRREALIS.go to ship
       ‘They want Palua to go out to the ship.’

Ivens (1937) shows that the Gela ‘mind’ term _lio-_ is similarly used. It takes a possessor suffix
like any inalienably possessed noun, but is accompanied by the verbal morphemes that one
would expect with a verb like ‘want’.

    Finally, another strategy for expressing ‘want’ is to use the verb ‘say’, a natural extension
of internal speech and thought. In Bariai (NNG) _keo_ serves as both ‘say’ and ‘want’, but its
sense is disambiguated by the construction that follows it (Gallagher & Baehr 2005).

__igt__
       Ti-keo     pa=gid taine ngan ti-la              dadanga-i.
       they-say to=them female to            they-go garden-at
       ‘They tell the women to go to the garden.’

__igt__
         Na-keo ga sabale         gaisala   eao Ø-nam.
         I-say    that tomorrow morning thou thou-come
         ‘I want you to come tomorrow morning.’

Bowern (2011:151) notes a similar development in Titan (Adm).


11.6 Evaluation: good vs bad

    Because what is experienced may be animate, inanimate or abstract and because evaluation
is in the mind of the experiencer, evaluative terms, particularly those for ‘good’ and ‘bad’, may
be applied to both animates and inanimates. As value terms they stand alone, but they are also
a component of BPMs (§9.5) or they follow terms used specifically to mark a quality as
customary or habitual (§11.3).

11.6.1 Good

Terms for ‘good’ have been difficult to reconstruct. Two reconstructions are proposed: POc
_*puia_ and PEOc _*leka_.

[8] NF denotes the non-factual complementiser: in other words, what follows it is a clause in irrealis mood.

596 Malcolm Ross and Meredith Osmond


   With regard to _*puia_, originally an alternant _*uia_ was reconstructed. The reflexes that
require this are those from Takia and its neighbours and Hote, shown under ‘cf. also’. These
appear to be instances of an idiosyncratic sound change in a frequently used item. However,
the Loniu, Titan and Sio reflexes are those that would have occurred if _*p_ were between two
vowels. and it is reasonable to infer that in these languages, at least, the reflex of _*puia_ once
behaved as a stative verb and took subject prefixes (e.g. i- 3SG). The Gitua and Labu forms
and the second Nehan form reflect _*puaia_, and this was perhaps a POc alternant.

   The form _*puia_ is unusual because it contains a sequence of three vowels, which is very
unusual in POc (otherwise occurring, as far as is known, only in _*kaiu_ ‘tree’). Indeed, it is
tempting to reconstruct either †_*pʷia_ or †_*puya_ in order to adhere to a POc canonic shape, but
†_*pʷia_ is eliminated by Loniu, Kaiep, Manam and Nehan reflexes, since _*-u-_ is retained and
_*puya_ is hard to justify in the light of so many reflexes of _*-i-_ rather than _*-y-_.

   The presence of _*-u-_ in _*puia_ is also unexpected, as non-Oceanic cognates reflect PMP
_*ma-pia_, i.e. the root is _*pia_.

A number of reflexes point to a final _*-i_. Whilst the Arosi and Bauan reflexes under ‘cf. also’
self-evidently reflect *saqat plus the transitive suffix _*-i_, the gloss ‘bad’ indicates that this is
not the source of _*-i_ in the items listed below and that they perhaps reflect an alternant _*saqati_.[9]

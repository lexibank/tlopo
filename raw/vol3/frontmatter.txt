The Lexicon of Proto Oceanic: The culture and
  environment of ancestral Oceanic society 3. Plants
Malcolm Ross, Andrew Pawley and Meredith Osmond, editors
PL 599




This is the third in a series of six volumes on the lexicon of Proto Oceanic, the ancestor of the
Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family. Each volume deals with a particular
domain of culture and/or environment and consists of a collection of essays each of which
presents and comments on lexical reconstructions of a particular semantic field within that
domain.
Volume 3 examines the terms that Proto Oceanic speakers used to name plants and parts of
plants. After the general introduction to the series, Chapter 2 places Proto Oceanic plant
naming within its biogeographic and ethnographic context, Chapter 3 examines its major
plant categories from an ethnobotanical standpoint, and Chapter 4 reconstructs terms for parts
of plants. Chapters 5-8 present reconstructed names of wild plants, organised by vegetation
habitat: the coastal strand, mangrove swamp, rain forest and secondary forest. Chapters 9-13
investigate the naming of cultivated plants: staple foods , green vegetables, nut and fruit trees ,
the coconut and a variety of cultivated non-food plants.

Appendix A: Data sources and collation


1 Data sources
The subject matter ofthis volume is quite narrowly constrained. As a result we collated data
not only from the sources used for the project generally but also from compilations of plant
names in a number of languages. Both the ge:neral and the plant name data sources are listed
below. The source of an item is generally listed against it in the text only where it is not one
of those listed below or where it is an exceptional source for that particular language.


1.1 General sources
Sources are conveniently divided into published and unpublished.

1.2 Plant name sources
The major source for Vanuatu and New Caledonia was Lynch (2004a), which collates data
from a variety of sources including Clark (1996a) and Lynch (200lc). Some items from
Vanuatu languages were also taken from Gow1ers (1976) and Wheatley (1992), and Walsh
(2004) provided a number of Raga items.
   All or almost all plant names for each of the languages listed below were drawn from the
source( s) shown.

Other botanical sources were also used, but yielded so few items that we have shown the
source against them in the text.


2 Linnaean terms
It is quite common to find different Linnaean terms in the literature for the same species. I
have relied on two internet publications, the International Plant Name Index (IPNI) and the
Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) to resolve these conflicts. These sources are listed in the
references as IPNI (2004) and APNI ( 1991) respectively.

3 Collation
The collation stage ofthe project consisted in the first instance of creating a data base of vo-
cabulary materials in a defined set of semantic domains from Oceanic languages for which
data were already available (see §1.1). This data base was kept in text files on Macintosh
computers. Files were organised in accordance with a modified version of the Summer In-
stitute of Linguistics' 'standard format' in whic:h fields within each record are labelled with
an initial backs lash followed by a single letter. In our version of the format, each record was
terminated with a carriage return, i.e. each record occupied a single line. Each record con-
tained a single word in a single language with associated information (a code relating to the
language's subgroup, a gloss and any other semantic information, the source, and any other
notes the researcher chose to add). The Macintosh allowed non-standard characters to be cre-
ated and viewed on screen. Records were organised on screen into putative cognate sets. The
use of text files rather than files in a proprietary database format meant (i) that it was easy to
view them on screen; (ii) that it was easy to manipulate them with a variety of text editors and
word processors; (iii) that more complex repetitive processes could be performed by writing
small programs in the Icon programming language Griswold & Griswold 1990; and (iv) that
it was relatively easy to import and reformat other people's data sets and to export collated
material into publications in preparation.
     Although there are accepted or standard orthographies for a number of the languages
from which data are cited here, data were transcribed at the collation stage into a standard
orthography (see Ross 1988: 3-4) to enable us to recognise cognates and to spot regular
changes more quickly. This orthography is retained in the citation of data in these volumes.

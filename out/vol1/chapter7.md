## 1.1. Questions


Between 3000 and 1000 BC, speakers of Austronesian languages spread across Island Southeast Asia and western Melanesia and into the previously uninhabited islands of the Central Pacific.[^1] By about 1000 AD they had colonised the whole of Polynesia and Micronesia and had settled Madagascar, more than half a world away.[^2] This farflung maritime dispersal of closely related peoples, without parallel in human history until the West European expansion of the 15th-20th centuries AD, must have been based on a fairly efficient sailing technology. What was this technology? When and where did it develop? To what extent was it modified during the Austronesian diaspora?

There is already an extensive literature on these questions, much of it by culture historians who apply the typological comparative and distributional methods (discussed in [§1.2](#s-1-2)) to sailing craft and sailing techniques. Our contribution will be to see what light can be thrown on these questions by comparing the vocabulary for watercraft and seafaring across the Austronesian family, using the genetic comparative method of historical linguistics. We will focus on the early phases of Austronesian expansion, that is, on cognate sets that probably go back more than 2,000 years. Little will be said here about the complex developments in boatbuilding which have taken place in Island Southeast Asia over the last couple of millenia, well after the main Austronesian dispersal across and beyond this region, or about modifications in the design of craft that according to Haddon and Hornell ([Haddon 1937](../references.md#source-Haddon1937), [Haddon & Hornell 1938](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938), [Hornell 1936](../references.md#source-Hornell1936)) have taken place in various regions of Oceania within the last millenium. An exhaustive study of material relevant to reconstructing terms for vessel design and seafaring at all stages in the history of the Austronesian family would take several years and fill a very large book.

## 1.2. Reconstructions based on comparative typology: methodological problems


Describing the sailing craft and navigation techniques in the Indo-Pacific region, and theorising about their origins and development have been popular pastimes among Western scholars since the first European explorers visited the region.[^3] The fairly close correlation between the distribution of outrigger canoes and that of the Austronesian language family has not escaped the attention of culture historians.

Those writers who have drawn conclusions about the nature of early Austronesian sailing craft and navigation have generally relied on the 'typological comparative method' of historical reconstruction. The typological method is a theory of structural types, making assumptions about how structural features are linked in systems, what kinds of changes are possible or likely, which types are logically prior to others, etc. The kinds of historical inferences this method can give, when applied to a range of contemporary systems, are probabilistic ones: for example, the inference that type X is more likely to have given rise to type Y than vice versa. The typological method is often allied to a distributional one. The assumption is that one can infer much about the antiquity of a given structural type or feature from its geographic distribution. For instance, the observation that a certain complex of cultural features is found among widely scattered peoples speaking related languages can be taken as evidence that the complex was present in a common ancestral culture. On the other hand, if such a complex has a more restricted but continuous geographic distribution it is likely to have been an innovation that diffused over this region after the dispersal of the ancestral population.

In his _Sailing Craft of Indonesia_ Adrian [Horridge](../references.md#source-Horridge1986) ([1986](../references.md#source-Horridge1986):2-3) employs a distributional argument when he writes:

> The very wide distribution of their homogeneous cultural heritage shows that [the ancestral Malayo-Polynesians][^4] had an excellent knowledge of outrigger canoes for transporting fire, family, pigs, chickens and dogs, not to mention dozens of useful plants, by sea.

Other passages in the same book present some fairly detailed conclusions about the design of the vessels. These are based partly on the logic of technology - what is possible and what is likely in the development of techniques, given certain equipment and natural resources, engineering knowledge, navigational knowledge, climatic conditions, etc. - and partly on distributional grounds.


<a id="p-175"></a>

> The signs are that the original Malayo-Polynesian rig was a two-boom triangular sail fixed by the point (tack) in the bows of the boat and held up by a loose prop, with a rope to the outriggers to prevent it falling sideways. (p.56)

> All Malayo-Polynesian rigs therefore had the fundamental property that the sail could be tilted fore and aft to balance the sail with reference to the balance of the hull and load on the steering paddle. In principle they could all be steered like a windsurfer, simply by tilting the sail fore and aft. These rigs, like the outrigger canoes for which they were adapted, were invented in Island South-East Asia, and spread with the Malayo-Polynesian expansion, although they may have been known in Indonesia before that time. (p.58)

> The idea of a boat built from sewn planks was known to the Polynesian migrants into the Pacific, and perhaps came from mainland Asia before 5000 Be, but the idea of fixing the planks edge-to-edge with dowels seems to have spread later from the mainland, with the same distribution as the use of metal for boat-building tools … All the techniques needed to make a lashed-lug boat, sewn of course, were known to the earliest Polynesians, and the projecting lugs carved in situ are a feature of many traditional Polynesian, Micronesian and Melanesian boats. (pp.57-58)

In the following passage, Horridge combines structural and distributional arguments with archaeological evidence:

> The earliest evidence of trading by boats that could beat against the wind is provided by pottery with a particular design, known as Lapita, that spread rapidly from Western Melanesia far into what is now Polynesia about 3000 years ago. The vessels carrying the potters were probably double canoes because nothing else in the region is sufficiently seaworthy. (p.4)

The strength of technology-based comparative studies is in the detailed historical inferences concerning design and construction which they yield. That is not to say such inferences are necessarily reliable. There are some serious methodological weaknesses associated with all reconstructions based purely on the logic of types and the distributional method.

Because innovations in material culture sometimes spread and replace older usages and because some innovations are made independently in different places, the widespread geographic distribution of a feature or even a complex of features does not guarantee its great antiquity. Nor does the restricted distribution of a feature guarantee that it is a recent innovation. The method of comparative typology is unable to distinguish in a reliable way between 'inherited' and 'borrowed' elements or features within a continuing community or cultural tradition, that is, between institutions which have been handed down from generation to generation within the community or tradition since a given point in time, and institutions that have entered the tradition from outside since that point in time. The method is also unable to distinguish reliably between 'retentions' and 'innovations' within the same tradition, that is, between features that have been part of a tradition since a given point in time and those that were developed later.

In Indonesia and contiguous regions of Island Southeast Asia the problems of distinguishing retentions, innovations and borrowings in sailing technology are particularly acute. There, the local sailing traditions of Austronesian-speaking communities have not only diversified and influenced one another but have been exposed to numerous alien traditions coming from mainland Asia. Horridge acknowledges this point:

> The Malayo-Polynesians diversified as they spread, and from them are descended the specialized boat-building and boat-loving maritime groups of Indonesia, namely the Bajau or Sea Gypsies, the Buginese from the Gulf of Bone, the Makassarese, the Mandar people from West Sulawesi, and the Butungese from South-east Sulawesi, and the Madurese … [and] the fishennen of the islands of Bawean, Masalembu and Sepudi in the Java Sea, the traders of Bonerate and Pulau Palu'e in the Flores Sea, the whalers of Lamalerap on Lomblen in the Timor Straits, the men of Luang in the Barat Daya Islands, and the numerous Buginese colonies which control a wide network of trade in miscellaneous goods. All these very diverse groups have inherited the Malayo-Polynesian seafaring tradition, and methods of building outrigger canoes which over the past two millenia have been mixed with traditions from the Indian Ocean and the West to give the modern hatch-patch of boat and canoe styles. (pp.3-4) [our italics: AP & MP.]


<a id="p-176"></a>

Horridge's remarks remind us that the testimony of central Pacific cultures is likely to be crucial in reconstructing early Austronesian sailing technology. The relative isolation of the peoples of the more remote Pacific islands may have allowed some of them to continue the early Austronesian sailing culture with fewer changes than most peoples in Island Southeast Asia.

A problem arises when students of comparative technology dabble in comparative linguistics without underpinning them by the careful studies of sound correspondences and subgroupings needed to distinguish between cognates, accidental resemblances and borrowings or to determine the relative chronology of linguistic innovations. The results of such dabblings will be largely worthless. Haddon and Hornell's ([Haddon 1937](../references.md#source-Haddon1937), [Haddon & Hornell 1938](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938), [Hornell 1936](../references.md#source-Hornell1936)) admirable survey, Canoes of Oceania, is marred by a number of fanciful historical speculations which rest in part on naive readings of linguistic similarities. To a much larger extent, however, their fanciful historical inferences rest on a diffusionist interpretation of the comparative material culture, uninformed by systematic study of comparative vocabulary or by archaeological evidence.


<a id="s-1-3"></a>
## 1.3. The Genetic Comparative Method


There is a means of escape from the limitations of comparative typology. It is the special virtue of the comparative or genetic method of historical linguistics that it can, in principle, (a) define genetic continuity in certain parts of the vocabulary of each language in a language family, distinguishing resemblances due to common origin from resemblances due to borrowing, and (b) assign a relative chronology to innovations occurring within the languages of a linguistic family.[^5]

However, linguists need not feel unduly smug about the genetic comparative method. It applies only to a restricted part of each language-culture system, namely the stock of morphemes that have cognates in genetically related languages. Often it happens that linguistics is silent in the face of competing hypotheses derived from comparative technology, say, about techniques of manufacture, because no distinctive terms can be reconstructed for the technological elements in question. And while the genetic method often allows us to make strong inferences about the presence of some things in a reconstructed language-culture system, it does not tell us what was absent. That is to say, our inability to reconstruct a term for a particular element in protolanguage L is not conclusive proof that speakers of L lacked a term for that element. Within these limitations, the genetic comparative method remains a powerful tool.

## 1.4. Lexical sources


Many previous publications isolate Austronesian cognate sets referring to canoe parts and seafaring. However, works compiled by linguists only list such cognate sets as isolated items within a larger body of semantically unordered material. This chapter draws together published comparisons and extends them. Sources giving relevant cognate sets or sound correspondences relevant to determining cognation include Bender et al (1983), [Biggs](../references.md#source-Biggs1978) ([1978](../references.md#source-Biggs1978), 1993),[^6] [Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1970) ([1970](../references.md#source-Blust1970), 1972b, 1976a, 1978a, 1978b, 1980b, 1983-84a, 1986, 1989), [Clark](../references.md#source-Clark1994) ([1994](../references.md#source-Clark1994)), [Collins](../references.md#source-Collins1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-Collins1983)), [Dahl](../references.md#source-Dahl1973) ([1973](../references.md#source-Dahl1973)), [Dempwolff](../references.md#source-Dempwolff1938) ([1938](../references.md#source-Dempwolff1938)), [Ferrell](../references.md#source-Ferrell1969) ([1969](../references.md#source-Ferrell1969)), [Geraghty](../references.md#source-Geraghty1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-Geraghty1983)), [Jackson](../references.md#source-Jackson1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-Jackson1983)), [Milke](../references.md#source-Milke1961) ([1961](../references.md#source-Milke1961), 1968), [Pallesen](../references.md#source-Pallesen1985) ([1985](../references.md#source-Pallesen1985)), [Pawley](../references.md#source-Pawley1972) ([1972](../references.md#source-Pawley1972)), [Reid](../references.md#source-Reid1971) ([1971](../references.md#source-Reid1971)), [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1988) ([1988](../references.md#source-Ross1988)), [Sneddon](../references.md#source-Sneddon1984) ([1984](../references.md#source-Sneddon1984)) and [Tryon](../references.md#source-Tryon1976) ([1976](../references.md#source-Tryon1976)). We have also consulted dictionaries of many contemporary languages.


<a id="s-1-5"></a>
## 1.5. Organisation of reconstructions and cognate sets


Some fifty cognate sets will be discussed. These are ordered by semantic domains, such as type of vessel, beginning with types of vessels and hull construction and going on to outrigger structure, superstructure, sail and rigging, accessories, launching, beaching and anchoring and ending with terms for seafaring and seafarers.

Each reconstructed word or etymon is attributed to a certain level of the Austronesian family tree, the highest level justified by the distribution of the cognate set across subgroups. Below it are listed the cognates from contemporary languages. These are ordered according to subgroup, usually proceeding roughly in a west to east direction, e.g. Western Malayo-Polynesian cognates precede CMP cognates which in turn precede Eastern Malayo-Polynesian cognates. As well as giving the highest-level reconstruction we often give intermediate-level reconstructions for named interstages, especially when the the interstage reconstruction differs significantly in form or meaning from the highest-order reconstruction. When listing cognates we occasionally acknowledge sources when the evidence comes from [Haddon](../references.md#source-Haddon1937) ([1937](../references.md#source-Haddon1937)), [Hornell](../references.md#source-Hornell1936) ([1936](../references.md#source-Hornell1936)) or Haddon and and Hornell (1938) or a source other than a published dictionary.

## 2.1. Types of vessel


[Haddon and Hornell](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938) ([1938](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938): 70-72) referred to ten or so putative cognate sets having the general sense of 'canoe' or 'boat' that go back to an early stage or stages of Austronesian. While early Austronesian speakers probably had several different named types of craft, most of Haddon and Hornell's etymologies are false. Only one of their putative cognate sets can be attributed to an early Austronesian interstage-that pointing to PCEMP _&ast;waŋka_, POc _&ast;waga_.


<a id="p-178"></a>

POc _&ast;waga_ (phonetically [waŋga] with [ŋg] being a single phoneme) is widely reflected within Oceanic as a general term for a canoe or boat with a hull, as opposed to a raft. In many Oceanic languages, however, the reflex of _&ast;waga_ refers chiefly to large sailing canoes and other large vessels, in contrast to dugout canoes and small outrigger canoes. This range of meanings, taken together with the cognate set under PMP _&ast;katiR_, suggests that _&ast;waga_ may have had two senses in POco

The primary sense of POc _&ast;waga_ was perhaps 'large sailing canoe' in contrast to paddling canoes (dugouts and small outrigger canoes). This sense is widely reflected across subgroups of Oceanic. As the name of the largest and most prestigious type, &ast;waga would have been a natural choice as a generic term for all types of canoe and in a number of languages the generic sense has become primary. An example is from Kilivila, the language of the Kiriwina people of the Trobriand Islands (reported by [Haddon](../references.md#source-Haddon1937) ([1937](../references.md#source-Haddon1937):267-269), based on [Malinowski](../references.md#source-Malinowski1922) ([1922](../references.md#source-Malinowski1922)) and correspondence with Malinowski). In Kiriwina there are four named types of canoes. The _kewoʔu_ is a simple dugout with outrigger, used in the lagoon. The _kalipoulo_, a fishing canoe, is a larger dugout with several designs. These have in common a hull built up with a washstrake on each side, and transverse carved and painted breakwaters, and the hull usually has pointed ends, carved and painted. There is often a platform over the booms. The sail is a lateen. The _masawa_ is a large trading canoe, similarly constructed to the _kalipoulo_ but with two clinker-built washstrakes on each side and twenty or more booms covered by a continuous platform. It carries a large, elongated steering oar worked by two men. The _nagega_ is larger and more seaworthy than the _masawa_, with higher sides and more carrying capacity and a central standing mast, as opposed to a leaning mast stepped within the hull and shored by a prop. The generic term for all these craft is waga. In another part of Papua, around Samarai, [Abel](../references.md#source-Abel1902) ([1902](../references.md#source-Abel1902):62) reports that _vaga_ is the generic for all kinds of sailing canoes, but evidently excluded canoes without outriggers or sails.

Cognates belonging to the set above are sometimes placed together with forms listed below:

```
WMP: Malay       waŋkaŋ         'Chinese junk'
WMP: Javanese    waŋkaŋ         'Chinese junk'
WMP: Ngaju Dayak vaŋkaŋ         'Chinese junk'

Although the forms in the above two sets show a striking resemblance to POc _&ast;waga_, they are not demonstrably cognate. In the first set, initial _w-_ is irregular, suggesting that these are borrowed words, though the source of the borrowing is unclear (Alexander Adelaar, pers.comm.). In the second set, the uncharacteristic occurrence of the cluster _ŋk_ in the Philippine and Formosan forms suggests borrowing from a Malayo-Javanic or Sulawesi source (Lawrence Reid, pers.comm.). Tagalog and Cebuano b are not the regular reflexes of PMP _&ast;w_. At present, most of the few coastal Austronesian-speaking communities left on Taiwan proper use large bamboo sailing rafts for fishing. However, there is evidence that in the nineteenth century other kinds of craft including double outriggers were in use. [Scott](../references.md#source-Scott1982) ([1982](../references.md#source-Scott1982):337) cites an eighteenth century Chinese observer, Huang Shi-ching, describing a built-up dugout canoe called a _manka_ [or _banka_] as follows:

> A manka is a single tree trunk hollowed out, with wooden planks fastened on both sides with rattans; since they have no putty for caulking and water easily enters, the barbarians keep baling with a ladle.

It is likely (Mark Donohue, pers.comm.) that the Chinese characters in question are from the Hokkien dialect and should be read as _banka_, not _manka_ as reported by Scott. The form _&ast;ba(ŋ)ka_ is however reflected both in CMP and Oceanic, and must be attributed to their common ancestor, which [Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1993) ([1993](../references.md#source-Blust1993)) labels PCEMP.

The next term is reconstructable as far back as PMP. But note the disagreement between WMP and Oceanic witnesses as to its meaning.

Although the WMP cognates denote 'outrigger float', there is a much stronger candidate for that meaning in PMP, namely _&ast;(c,s)a(R)man_ ([§4.1](#s-4-1)). Therefore we conclude that _&ast;katiR_ is unlikely to have meant 'outrigger float' in PMP and that the WMP cognates probably show semantic change. In Oceanic, reflexes of _&ast;katiR_ are confined to Western Oceanic but are widely dispersed within that large group. The Western Oceanic comparisons strongly point to an earlier meaning such as 'canoe hull' or 'small outrigger canoe'.

Evidence for the reconstruction occurs in two geographically separated primary subgroups of Oceanic, but apparently nowhere else. Despite this distribution, the evidence would be clear enough, were it not for (i) the meaning of the Proto Southeast Solomonic term, reconstructable as 'plank-built canoe', and (ii) the fact that the Lau, Baegu, Kwai and Arosi reflexes could well reflect, not _&ast;tola_, but POc _&ast;(q)oRa_ 'strake, probably topstrake (washstrake) ([§2.4](#s-2-4)) (Cristobal-Malaitan languages regularly lose POc _&ast;t_). It is possible that the forms _ola_/_ora_ reflect a falling together of _&ast;tola_ and _&ast;(q)oRa_, the meaning narrowing in favour of _&ast;(q)oRa_ and then transferred to Bugotu, Gela _tola_.

Evidence from other Southeast Solomonic languages further confuses the issue. Gela and Tolo (Guadalcanal) _tiola_ 'generic term for plank-built canoes' and 'Are'are _iora_, Sa'a _iola_ 'plank-built canoe' might be explained as deriving from a bimorphemic form _&ast;ti-(q)oRa_. This might be liable to conflation with reflexes of _&ast;tola_ also.

## 2.2. Double canoes


It has been suggested (Roger Green, pers.comm.) that the ocean-going double-hulled canoe was an innovation of Oceanic speakers. He argues that it was large double canoes, stable and able to carry big loads while being sailed with traditional rig, that were the key to the transport of people, crops and domestic animals to the far-flung islands of Remote Oceania (the Pacific islands east and north of the New Guinea area, the Bismarck Archipelago and the main Solomon Islands chain).[^8] The design of double canoes varied in some details from place to place but the main structure consisted of two dugout hulls, placed parallel and usually one to two metres apart, joined by booms, with a platform built amidships. In the most efficient craft, represented by the Fijian _drua_, one hull was slightly smaller than the other. At the time of first European contact such craft were almost wholly confined to Remote Oceania, being present in New Caledonia and Fiji, in many parts of Polynesia and in a restricted region of the central Caroline Islands. In western Melanesia double canoes were made by the Mailu, of south-east coast Papua. The Mailu speak a non-Austronesian language but many of their canoe terms (and other parts of their vocabulary) are from Austronesian; it seems likely that the population of the Mailu area was once largely Austronesian-speaking. The Motu _laɣatoi_, a multi-hulled craft, can be derived from the double canoe.

No term for double canoe can safely be reconstructed for any very early Austronesian interstage. However, a number of Oceanic languages reflect the following form:

PEOc _&ast;paqurua_ is a compound formed from POc _&ast;paqu(s)_ 'bind, lash; construct by tying together' ([Ch.9, § 10](chapter9.md#s-10)) and _&ast;rua_ 'two'. While it is possible that Lau _foorua_ is borrowed from a Polynesian language, the details of form do not support this notion. Lau has the independent bases _foo_ 'bind' and _rua_ 'two'. [Haddon](../references.md#source-Haddon1937) ([1937](../references.md#source-Haddon1937): 77) reports Kinilaulau (Carteret Islands) _haulau_, _holua_ 'outrigger canoe ', but this term is probably borrowed from a Polynesian language believed to have been formerly spoken on the island or from nearby Takuu.

[Friederici](../references.md#source-Friederici1928) ([1928](../references.md#source-Friederici1928):31) suggests that the double canoe of Oceania (or at least the type with smaller and finer-pointed port hull) originated from a canoe with a single outrigger, on the grounds that (a) in the double canoes of Polynesia and Fiji one of the two hulls is usually smaller, the smaller hull being called by the term for the outrigger float (e.g. _hama_ in Tongan), and (b) the connecting poles between the hulls are also called by the word for the outrigger booms (_kiato_ in Tongan). On the other hand, [Haddon and Hornell](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938) ([1938](../references.md#source-HaddonHornell1938): 43) argue that the most likely origin of the double canoe is from two dugouts lashed together or a short distance apart. They also note the possibility that the single outrigger canoe may ultimately be derived from the double canoe by reducing the port hull to form a float. As the smaller hull and the float and the connecting poles serve the same purpose in both types of vessels, the extension of terms seen in Tongan _hama_ and _hato_ is natural. On logical grounds alone it is hard to choose between these historical interpretations. And in this case the linguistic evidence is relatively unhelpful.


<a id="p-183"></a>

Numerous other reconstructions, attributable to interstages lower than PMP or POc, can be made for types of craft. For example, the following doublets (distinct words coexisting in a language whose similar form and meaning suggest they ultimately trace back to the same source) can be reconstructed:

<table>

<a id="p-184"></a>

These forms have sometimes been compared with Oceanic forms represented by Tongan _folau_ 'voyage, travel by sea', Fijian _volau_ 'boat shed' (cf. _&ast;pa-laSud_, [§9.2](#s-9-2)). A PPn reconstruction for a small canoe used close to shore is well supported:

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>PPn</strong></td><td> </td>
<td>
<i>&ast;paopao</i>
</td>
<td>
'<span>small outrigger or dugout canoe for inshore use</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>Nukuoro</td><td><i>paopao</i></td>
<td>
'<span>double-ended single outrigger with two booms</span>'</td>
</tr>
</table>



A possible cognate occurs in a single Western Oceanic language, Mekeo of the Central Province of Papua. East Mekeo has _papao_ (dialect _fafao_) 'small canoe for children, also used as a trough for feeding pigs'. Reduction of the first vowel cluster of a reduplicated word is characteristic of Mekeo (Alan Jones, pers.comm.). This comparison points to POc _&ast;paopao_ 'small outrigger canoe', though it needs strengthening by further cognates beyond Polynesian.

[Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1986) ([1986](../references.md#source-Blust1986):33) reconstructs the term _&ast;dakit_, noting a number of reflexes within the WMP region and a regular reflex in one Oceanic language, Motu. To these may be added many other Philippine and Northern Sulawesi reflexes (given in [Reid 1971](../references.md#source-Reid1971)) and possible reflexes in CMP and Western Oceanic.

[Chowning](../references.md#source-Chowning1985) ([1985](../references.md#source-Chowning1985): 59) gives the following as possible cognates, although the final vowel is problematic:

## 2.3. Hull construction


In pre-European times three basic hull designs were found in Austronesian-speaking communities: (a) a dugout built from a single log; (b) a five-part canoe, composed of dug-out hull, with the sides raised by sewing one side piece or strake to each side, with forked, crutch-shaped pieces at each end; and (c) a built-up canoe, in which a number of planks or strakes are added to a keel. The keel may consist of a thick plank or a dugout underbody (or sometimes two or even three dugouts joined).

Ethnologists have argued on logical grounds that types (b) and (c) developed from the dugout prototype. In his account of Philippine boat-building in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, [Scott](../references.md#source-Scott1982) ([1982](../references.md#source-Scott1982): 337-338) sketches a theory of the evolution of the hull of Philippine boats:

> In the ship-building technique [developed in China and Europe in the Middle Ages] … a rigid framework of keel and ribs is first constructed … and the wooden planking of the hull then nailed to it with metal spikes or wooden trenails. The older technique was to build the hull first, plank by plank carved to fit, and to fasten the ribs in afterwards. This technique is probably a natural development of the one-log dugout canoe by adding one board to each side to obtain higher freeboard.

> By increasing the number of such additional planks, a fully developed boat or ship is produced. But as the sides of the canoe, or banca, are thinned, some transverse strengthening is required, and this can be provided by running strut-like thwarts across the vessel, securing them to the sides without nails by means of tambukos [lugs] and lashing. For this purpose a flexible rib can be pressed down across all of them and lashed securely to the matching tambukos carved on each plank. Finally a combination of such thwarts and ribs lashed together … produces a sturdy vessel whose hull and other structural parts are held firm under prestressed tension.

The question arises as to whether any or all of these features of hull design are attested in the vocabulary of PMP and other interstages.

PMP _&ast;papan_ evidently referred to any plank or board (see [Ch.3, §3](chapter3.md#s-3). S). It might be argued that this term could have been independently applied to canoe strakes or planks by different daughter languages after the break-up of PMP. However, the fact that in diverse Malayo-Polynesian languages reflexes of _&ast;papan_ are consistently used of canoe planks, even in cases when another general word for plank or board has developed, is a fairly strong indication that this application goes back to PMP times.

Possible cognates of _&ast;(q)oRa_ occur in Cristobal-Malaitan languages of the Southeast Solomonic family: Arosi ora, Lau ola 'plank-built canoe (built up from a plank centre keel, with bow and stern keels), with no outrigger'. As noted in [§2.1](#s-2-1), however, their interpretation is difficult, as they could also reflect POc _&ast;tola_ 'large canoe'.

The question of how planks were joined is connected to the question of whether early Austronesian communities used stone or metal tools, as the following remarks by [Scott](../references.md#source-Scott1982) ([1982](../references.md#source-Scott1982):338-339) make clear:

> Historically there are two methods by which the planks in [Philippine] plank-built boats are fastened together - sewing and edge-pegging. Sewing - or, better said, lacing - the boards together is done by drilling a matching row of holes through the two boards near their adjoining edges, and running rattan strips through them in the manner of lacing up a shoe or basketball. This is the older technique and it can be performed with even a simple stone or bone drill, as was still being done in remote Pacific islands … Stone tools are probably inadequate for drilling deep holes in the thin edges of boards, and it is therefore not surprising that edge-pegging does not appear in those distant Pacific islands whose inhabitants presumably migrated there without metal.


<a id="p-187"></a>

We can reconstruct PMP _&ast;kiRam_ 'adze/axe' and _&ast;taRaqi_ (V) 'adze, carve' ([Ch.4, §4.1.1](chapter4.md#s-4-1)), with reflexes in Oceanic as well as in WMP witnesses, but there are no secure PMP or POc reconstructions for other equipment likely to have been used in boat-building.[^11] The current consensus among archaeologists is that the introduction of metal in eastern Asia postdated the break-up of PAn and PMP. Although [Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1976b) ([1976b](../references.md#source-Blust1976b)) has pointed to comparisons between Formosan and WMP forms suggesting that PAn speakers may have had a knowledge of metal tools, it is likely that this knowledge spread after the break-up of PAn and PMP.

## 2.6. Underbody, keel


There is no well-supported PMP reconstruction for 'dugout underbody of canoe (to which planking is added)' or for 'keel of built-up canoe' although _&ast;ba(ŋ)ka(q)_ ([§2.1](#s-2-1)) is a candidate for the former. Such a term is, however, clearly reconstructable for PCP:

## 2.7. Bilge, interior of hull


A PPn term for 'bilge, interior of hull' is well supported but cognates have not been noted elsewhere. In some Polynesian languages the same term refers to the interior of any container, such as a cup or basket.

Two well-attested POc locative nouns having the general sense of 'rear, back part', and 'front, front part', respectively, are reconstructable also with the specialised senses 'stern' and 'bow'. The first of these terms goes back at least to PMP.

## 2.9. Carved projecting end-pieces


Figure 25: POc _&ast;ijuŋ_ 'projecting headboard of prow' (from [Nevermann 1934](../references.md#source-Nevermann1934):285)

In many regions of Oceania larger canoes are constructed with a projecting headboard, part of it resting on the underbody abutting the washstrake, the rest sometimes extending several feet beyond. The end of such headboards usually consists of an elaborately carved figurehead, often a human or animal head or figure. There is a corresponding carved end-board at the stern, often standing more or less vertical. Such carved end-pieces are common, for example, in eastern Polynesia, the Solomon Islands, the Massim, the north coast of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago. A POc reconstruction can be made for the name of the headboard:

FIXME: From vol2: In vol. 1, p.189 the form POc _&ast;ijuŋ_ ‘projecting headboard of prow’ is erroneously given for &ast;(i,u)cuŋ. This is almost certainly the same etymon as that reconstructed here.

The central meaning of POc _&ast;ijuŋ_ was 'nose' and that of _&ast;ŋuju_ 'beak, snout, mouth'. Reflexes of both commonly have the extended sense 'projecting point'. The conjunction of Southeast Solomonic and Polynesian evidence suggests _&ast;ijuŋ_ as the more likely POc form carrying the sense 'projecting headboard'. No widespread cognate set for the stempiece has been noted.

## 2.10. Bow and stern covers, end-decking


While outrigger canoes with simple dugout hull are suitable for inshore sailing, seaworthy canoes require at least 'end-decking', minimally a V-shaped piece covering the bow and stern of the dugout hull. The next comparison points to a PCP term for this piece; PCP _&ast;tau_ may come from POc _&ast;taRu_ 'cover up':

Rick Jackson (pers.comm.) suggests Proto Trukic _&ast;tau_ (?) 'thwart, cross-seat in canoe' based on Carolinian, Trukese _sō_, Puluwat _ho_ 'thwart' . The above Polynesian comparisons also indicate PPn _&ast;tau-muʔa_ 'foredeck' and _&ast;tau-muri_ 'afterdeck'.

## 3.1. Platform


On medium-sized and large canoes a platform is sometimes built over the hull and the outrigger (or between the two bulls on double canoes); or two platforms are built, one on the outrigger and one on the starboard side. No PMP term for such a platform is reconstructable on present evidence but there is a strong candidate for a POc term, namely:

## 3.2. Cabin, deck hut


A deck hut is often added to large outrigger canoes but no widespread cognate set distinctively denoting such a structure has so far been noted. In a number of languages, reflexes of PMP _&ast;balay_, POc _&ast;pale_ 'hut, shed, open-sided house' ([Ch.3, §3.3](chapter3.md#s-3-3)) are used for a deck hut, for example, Fijian _vale waqa_ (lit. 'canoe house'), and _valevale_ 'hut' ([Hornell 1936](../references.md#source-Hornell1936):323), and this may also have been the case in POco

## 4.1. Outrigger float, outrigger side of canoe


The meaning 'outrigger float' can be attributed to PMP _&ast;(c,s)a(R)man_. This term is well attested in Oceanic and Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, but rare in WMP. In many WMP languages it has been replaced in this meaning by a reflex of _&ast;katiR_ ([§2.1](#s-2-1)). In Oceanic languages the reflex of POc _&ast;saman_ also has the sense of 'outrigger side of the canoe' in contrast to _&ast;katae_ 'free side of canoe' ([§4.4](#s-4-4)).

Oceanic languages of the Papuan Tip subgroup reflect _&ast;sarima_ rather than _&ast;saman_ (e.g. Motu _darima_, Suau (Daui) _salima_, Dobu _salime_, Molima _salima_). The _&ast;sarima_ forms possibly continue PMP _&ast;(c,s)a(R)man_ with irregular insertion of i. A similar insertion occurs in the PMP verbal prefix _&ast;paR-_, continued as POc _&ast;paRi-_.[^15]


<a id="p-192"></a>


<a id="s-4-2"></a>
## 4.2. Outrigger booms


The outrigger float is connected to the hull by booms, two or three in the case of small canoes but often five or more in larger, ocean-going canoes. A term for 'outrigger boom' can be constructed for POc but not for PMP:

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>POc</strong></td><td> </td>

</table>



Fijian _i-kaso_ 'outrigger boom' (zero for _&ast;i_ irregular) has sometimes been included in this set, but probably belongs to a separate set, along with such forms as Mota gaso 'rafter', Lau _ʔato_ 'rafter', which derive from a well-established etymon PMP &ast;kasaw, POc _&ast;kaso_ 'rafter' ([Ch.3, §3.4](chapter3.md#s-3-4)). However, the comparison with Lau _ato_ 'outrigger boom' suggests that POc _&ast;kaso_ probably had the general meaning 'connecting beam or brace', and as well as denoting crossbeams in a house may have been used as a synonym of _&ast;kiajo_.


<a id="p-193"></a>


<a id="s-4-3"></a>
## 4.3. Connective sticks attaching float


Three main methods of connecting the outrigger float to the booms can be distinguished: direct attachment, in which all of the booms are curved and lashed directly to the outrigger; indirect attachment, in which all of the booms are lashed to sticks that are implanted in or lashed to the float; and mixed attachment, in which some booms are attached directly and others indirectly. A great diversity of methods of indirect attachment is found.

A POc reconstruction for the connective sticks (stanchions, struts) was made by [Milke](../references.md#source-Milke1968) ([1968](../references.md#source-Milke1968)) and is well attested. A single cognate in the north-west New Guinea language, Numfor, allows tentative attribution of this etymon (with indeterminate final vowel) to Proto Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.

## 4.4. Starboard or hull side of outrigger canoe


A POc term can be reconstructed with the sense 'starboard or free side of the canoe, opposite the outrigger side (_&ast;saman_). In Central Pacific languages this term was also applied to the larger hull of a double canoe.

## 5. Sail and rigging


The characteristic Oceanic sail types are: (a) a triangular sprit sail with apex downwards and a spar along each of the two sides stemming from the apex, and (b) the (crab) claw sail-a triangular sail with the foreside fixed to a vertical mast and the afterside to a strongly curved sprit, whose lower end is attached to the foot of the mast. In Indonesia a number of other types of sail are found. Both fixed masts and moveable masts or props are used in Indonesia and in the Pacific Islands. The pole is stepped in a socket or on a thwart amidships and can be rotated and raked towards either end by means of running stays.

We give here a further quote from [Horridge](../references.md#source-Horridge1986) ([1986](../references.md#source-Horridge1986):56-57):

> It is my belief, based on distribution, comparative vocabularies and engineering principles, that the fixed mast with a halyard spread into Malayo-Polynesian communities from the Indian Ocean along with the introduction of the pulley. A large sail of matting could not be raised at sea without a pulley unless it was pushed up by a loose pole. There are no signs that even the last Austronesian-speaking migrants to move out into the Pacific knew about the tripod mast, the tilted rectangular sail, the pulley or the quarter rudder lashed to a rudder support. All of these features also spread only a little way up the mainland coast towards China … The tilted rectangular sail seems to have spread from the Indian Ocean, perhaps even from … Egypt, and to have arrived in Indonesia about 2,000 years ago … It has spread eastwards about as far as the quarter rudder and the pulley.

On some of these points the linguistic evidence appears to be silent. However, several terms for parts of the rig are attributable to POc or to later interstages of Oceanic:

Traditional Oceanic sails are made of matting, woven from pandanus leaves or other plant fibres. It is therefore not surprising to find that reflexes of POc _&ast;qebal_ 'pandanus mat' also have the meaning 'sail' in a few languages. Given that POc _&ast;layaR_ 'sail' is well established, it is likely that _&ast;qebal_ independently acquired the sense 'sail' in more than one daughter language. For the cognate set, see [Ch.4, §3.1](chapter4.md#s-3-1).

POc or PCP _&ast;jila_ has commonly (e.g. [Blust 1976a](../references.md#source-Blust1976a), [Geraghty 1986](../references.md#source-Geraghty1986), [Ross 1988](../references.md#source-Ross1988)) been glossed 'sheet', referring to the rope fastened to the lower corner of a sail to hold it and control its angle. The weight of the evidence, however, suggests that the term referred in POc to the booms or poles used to extend and support a triangular sail, denoting either the upper pole (the yard) or the lower pole (the boom). The use of reflexes of _&ast;jila_ to denote a fixed mast is confined to certain parts of Polynesia and this sense probably represents a post-PPn innovation. Most Oceanic craft with triangular sails do not use a fixed mast. In one kind of rigging (spritsail) the longer of the two poles extending the sail serves as the mast, with a mast-shore or stays to secure it, or with the apex of the two poles resting on the deck. In another kind of rigging (lateen), the mast is a separate moveable pole which pivots on a thwart in the dugout or on a socket on the deck and is supported by ropes (stays or sheets) tied to the hull or outrigger and sometimes by a mast-shore. The use of reflexes of _&ast;jila_ for 'mast' and for 'sheet' in various Oceanic languages can thus be derived from the original functions of the booms as supporting and controlling the sail.

POc _&ast;kaiu-tuqu(r)_ (evidently a compound of _&ast;kaiu_ 'wood, stick, pole' and _&ast;tuqu(r)_ 'stand; fixed') possibly referred to any main supporting timber including the prop or mast of a boat. This compound has reflexes in Southeast Solomonic, Polynesian and Nuclear Micronesian and possibly in Motu. It appears to have been already lexicalised in the immediate common ancestor of these groups.

As the Central Pacific languages in this comparison are all in the Fiji - West Polynesia region and innovations in canoe design are known to have moved freely within this region, the PCP antiquity of _&ast;vanā_ may be questioned. On the other hand, the correspondences Fijian _v_, Tongan, Samoan _f_ are regular, unlike recent Fijian-Polynesian borrowings, where Fijian _v_ has been borrowed as _v_. There is a possible cognate in Mota.

## 5.4. Mast stays


The following cognate set appears to be confined to Central Pacific:

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>PCP</strong></td><td> </td>
<td>
<i>&ast;tuku</i>
</td>
<td>
'<span>running stay supporting sail</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fij</td><td>Bauan</td><td><i>tuku</i></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>Tokelauan</td><td><i>tuku</i></td>
<td>
'<span>guy rope of traditional sail, fastened to the outrigger</span>'</td>
</tr>
</table>



These forms may be cognate with PCP _&ast;tuku_ 'let go, slacken'. Again, the narrow geographic range of this cognate set makes it hard to rule out diffusion.

## 6. Steering oar


A PMP term for steering oar is well supported. Contemporary languages which retain this term now apply it to rudders, but there is no reason to believe that rudders were in use in PMP times. A verbal use 'steer (a boat from the stem)' can also be reconstructed. In many languages this verbal use has now generalised to any kind of steering of a vessel or vehicle.

It is not clear whether PMP _&ast;be(R)(c,s)ay_ and _&ast;paluja_ differed in meaning. As the Sichule comparisons show, PMP _&ast;paluja_ probably derives from a root _&ast;luja_ denoting a paddle, with the verb 'paddle' derived by adding the causative prefix _&ast;pa-_. _&ast;paluja_ is now widely reflected, meaning both 'a paddle' and 'to paddle', but it may be that its use as a noun developed independently in various languages.


<a id="p-200"></a>

A third form attributable to PEOc, _&ast;sua(C)_, also has some reflexes glossed 'to paddle'. However, the meanings associated with its putative reflexes are quite varied. These meanings include (i) 'scull, in which a standing person holds the oar vertically', (ii) 'punt or pole a boat in shallow water', (iii) 'to paddle', (iv) 'a paddle' and (v) 'to steer'. The range of meanings suggests an original reference to a standing person using an oar or pole to propel or to steer a boat. (cf. also PCP _&ast;sua_ 'tack', [§9.2](#s-9-2).)

## 7.4. Bailer, bailing


Three terms to do with bailing water from a vessel can be reconstructed at the PMP level, all of which are continued in PWMP, POc and PCP.

Figure 26: POc _&ast;lima(s)_ or _&ast;nima(s)_, POc _&ast;asu_ 'bailer'

The following PMP reconstruction is given by [Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1978b) ([1978b](../references.md#source-Blust1978b): 94). Although 'scoop or ladle out' was probably the basic meaning, a number of Oceanic languages use the reflex of _&ast;asu_ to denote a bailer.

Compare WMP: Cebuano _tata_ 'empty a container by turning it upside down'. This suggests PMP _&ast;tata_ 'empty water from something'.

## 7.5. Portable fireplace


Seagoing canoes in many places carry a heap of sand, or an old clay pot or wooden basin filled with sand or earth, for use as a fireplace. A reconstruction for such an apparatus can be made only at PCP level:

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>PCP</strong></td><td> </td>
<td>
<i>&ast;tā-dravu</i>
</td>
<td>
'<span>portable fireplace or oven</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fij</td><td>Bauan</td><td><i>tā-dravu</i></td>
<td>
'<span>portable fireplace or oven</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>Tongan</td><td><i>tā-lafu</i></td>
<td>
'<span>portable fireplace or oven</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>Rennellese</td><td><i>tā-ŋahu</i></td>
<td>
(N) '<span>fire</span>'; (v) '<span>build a fire for illumination</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>East Uvean</td><td><i>ta-lafu</i></td>
<td>
'<span>cooking box filled with earth and small stones, formerly used in large sailing canoes</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pn</td><td>Tokelauan</td><td><i>tā-lefu-lefu</i></td>
<td>
'<span>ashtray</span>'</td>
</tr>
</table>

cf. also: 
<table>
<tr>

<td>
'<span>white ashes, a fireplace</span>'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NCV</td>
<td>Mota</td>
<td>tarowo</td>
<td>
'<span>white ashes</span>'</td>
</tr>
</table>


The PCP form can be analysed into two elements: the second is clearly _&ast;dravu_ 'fireplace, hearth', which reflects POc _&ast;rapu(R)_ 'hearth, fireplace; ashes' ([Ch.6, §2.4](chapter6.md#s-2-4)). The origin of _&ast;tā_ is less clear.

## 8. Launching and beaching, anchoring, sheltering vessels


Outrigger canoes are normally launched from beaches and hauled ashore rather than anchored when not in use. Anchors are not carried on small canoes (which may be left to drift or tethered to the reef while fishing) but stone anchors were commonly carried aboard larger vessels.

<a id="s-8-1"></a>
## 8.1. Rollers or skids


A PMP term for canoe rollers or skids is well attested, with reflexes in Philippine, Maluku and Oceanic languages.

## 8.2. Anchoring


There are two fairly well-supported PMP reconstructions to do with anchoring. In the following comparison the WMP terms refer to an anchor while the Oceanic terms support a verbal reconstruction 'be anchored or moored'.

## 8.3. Passage or channel, landing place


The PMP and POc term _&ast;sawaŋ_ or _&ast;sawaq_ appears to have been the conventional name for a channel for boats to pass through or to land, or an area of calm water giving safe anchorage. Blust (1983-84a: 113) reconstructs _&ast;sawaq_ 'channel'.

There is clear evidence for a POc compound consisting of _&ast;mata_ 'opening, entrance; focal point' plus _&ast;sawaŋ_, with the sense 'landing place for boats' . The Southeast Solomonic and Kiribatese forms suggest the POc compound had the form _&ast;mata-ni-sawaŋ_, or _&ast;mata-qi-sawaŋ_, with one of the two POc genitive particles _&ast;ni_ or _&ast;qi_ ([Hooper 1985](../references.md#source-Hooper1985)) linking the two nouns. However, the Admiralty Islands and Fijian forms do not reflect the genitive.

## 8.4. Boatshed


While boatsheds, for building and sheltering boats, are common in the Malayo-Polynesian speaking region, no really widespread cognate set for such a building has been noted outside the Central Pacific group. Some Oceanic languages use a simple term reflecting PMP _&ast;balay_ 'house or building, probably with open sides' as Lou (Admiralties) _pal_ 'boatshed'. Others use a compound nominal whose components, as in English, are the words for 'boat' and 'house' . It may be that speakers of PMP used such a compound but it is hard to rule out the possibility of independent parallel developments in the daughter languages. However, there is good evidence for a distinctive PCP term for boatshed, evidently incorporating the term for 'make a sea voyage' (see POc _&ast;palau(r)_, [§9.2](#s-9-2)):

Lawrence Reid (pers.comm.) suggests that the Malayo-Polynesian forms derive from a PAn phrase whose constituents were _&ast;pa_ 'go, towards' and _&ast;iaSud_ 'sea, ocean', giving the meaning 'seawards (from inland)' contrasting with _&ast;daya_ 'landwards, towards the interior (from the sea or coast)'. In some languages, reflexes of _&ast;pa-laSud_ are opposed to a phrase or parallel structure meaning 'go inland, go to the mountains'. POc continued _&ast;iaSud_ as _&ast;lau(r)_ in its original sense (e.g. Mota _lau_ 'seawards, coastwards') but evidently reanalysed the sequence _&ast;pa-iau(r)_ as a single morpheme.

Blust (l 978a:216) offers the following:

The sound correspondences are regular, but one would like further cognates to strengthen the comparison. Lau _tari_ 'steer, keep straight on' and 'Are'are _tari_/_roro_ 'steer a canoe (the steersman drawing the paddle towards himself with big strokes) show a superficial likeness but are not demonstrably cognate, because _t_ in Malaitan languages derives from POc _&ast;s_. Rick Jackson (pers.comm.) reconstructs Proto Western Micronesian _&ast;taraki_ 'sail, travel by sea' with reflexes in Trukese, Ponapean and Marshallese but again the resemblance to PEMP _&ast;ta(d,R)i_ seems to be superficial.

## 9.4. Boat owner or captain


In the following set the first element is again _&ast;tau_ 'person, owner'. The agreement between Polynesian and Papuan Tip languages may be the result of parallel development. However, in both groups the formation of compounds with _&ast;tau_ is no longer productive, so the chances are that the compounds in question are quite old.

## 10. Conclusions


Upwards of twenty terms to do with watercraft and seafaring can be reconstructed for PMP. The comparative lexical evidence allows the following inferences. PMP speakers were familiar with outrigger sailing canoes. Various clues indicate that craft could be quite large. Hulls could be built up with planking. Skids or rollers were used to move vessels on land. A steering paddle was used. Large canoes probably carried anchors. Cargo and paddles, punting poles and bailers were carried on board.

Virtually all the reconstructable PMP canoe and seafaring terms were continued in POc and PCP. In addition, around ten terms can be attributed to POc and PCP that have not so far been reconstructed for PMP. While these figures are impressive, they probably represent only a small proportion of the total body of terms for canoes and seafaring used by the speech communities in question. In contemporary societies where large sailing canoes remain in use, it is usual for a language to have over one hundred terms for parts of the vessel alone.

Some of the POc and PCP terms which do not have known sources in PMP may be formal innovations. It seems likely, however, that in most cases the innovative forms replaced functionally equivalent PMP terms whose forms are not recoverable on present evidence. This conclusion rests on logical grounds: the presence of certain terms strongly implies that other functionally connected terms also existed. Thus, while we cannot reconstruct with certainty a PMP name for 'outrigger sailing canoe', we can reconstruct PMP terms for 'outrigger float', 'outrigger boom ', 'sail' and other relevant parts and equipment. It can therefore safely be inferred that PMP speakers were familiar with outrigger sailing canoes. Furthermore, it seems that all Oceanic languages have a general name for outrigger sailing canoes (as well as, usually, a variety of terms for specific types). It would be very surprising if such a name did not exist in PMP, even if it was not cognate with the term _&ast;waŋka_/_&ast;waga_ that has been reconstructed for PEMP and POc. The same reasoning applies, say, to 'canoe platform', though with slightly less force. A term for such a platform, placed amidships over hull and outrigger booms, is well supported for POc (_&ast;patar_) but not for PMP. However, a PMP term for 'load a vessel' and 'cargo, load carried by a vessel' is reconstructable and it is therefore likely that PMP speakers built platforms on their larger, cargo-carrying outrigger canoes. Although a PMP term for 'strake, plank (of canoe +)' is recoverable, implying familiarity with built-up canoes, no term for the end-decking of a built-up canoe-minimally, triangular end-pieces abutting the topstrake fore and aft-is attributable to PMP. But as end-decking of some sort is a functional necessity in built-up seagoing outrigger canoes, it is unlikely that PMP seagoing canoes would have lacked these essential parts.


<a id="p-209"></a>

Further work will undoubtedly add to the body of relevant lexical reconstructions. However, it is unlikely to fill all the gaps. Often the lexical evidence is not fine-grained enough to allow us to recover certain details of vessel design. For example, the lexical reconstructions for the sailing rig do not indicate whether the sails used by PMP speakers were triangular, crab claw or rectangular or whether their vessels had fixed or moveable masts (or both). Nor do the lexical reconstructions tell us whether PMP speakers made canoes with single or double outriggers (or both). There is another reason why it is sometimes difficult to trace changes in technological details through comparative linguistic evidence: whereas we can safely infer knowledge of certain things by the presence of terms for them, we cannot so readily infer ignorance from the lack of reconstructable terms. Consider the double-hulled canoe. A term for double canoe can be attributed to PPn but not to POc. Can we therefore conclude that such a craft was unknown to POc speakers? Certainly not. Inability to reconstruct a term for a certain referent in Proto X does not prove that the referent itself, and a term for it, were unknown to speakers of Proto X. The term may have been lost in all or most daughter languages and its former existence obscured.

The moral we might draw at this point is a rather obvious one: that for doing culture history several disciplines are, ultimately, better than one. Linguistics and comparative technology need each other, just as both need archaeology and comparative ethnography, to corroborate each other's evidence on certain questions and to provide testimony on points where the other disciplines are mute. It is, of course, important that each field of study contribute its own independent witness before synthesis is attempted. The challenge then becomes how to combine judiciously the evidence from different disciplines.


## Notes

[^1]: This is a slightly revised version of a paper which is included in Pawley and Ross, eds. 1994. Unlike other chapters in this volume, this chapter takes account of the Austronesian language family as a whole, rather than just of its Oceanic subgroup. We have done this because the topic of canoes and seafaring is, in an obvious way, intimately associated with the Austronesian dispersal, of which the Oceanic dispersal was simply the later part: to ignore the earlier part would be somewhat arbitrary. We are grateful to many colleagues for help. Robert Blust, Charles Grimes, Ric Jackson, Jeff Marck and Bernd Nothofer provided corrections to many points of detail as well as additional evidence. Sander Adelaar, Wal Ambrose, Mark Donohue, Paul Geraghty, Geoff Irwin, Alan Jones, Nigel Oram, Lawrence Reid and Malcolm Ross also offered valuable comments or data.

[^4]: Horridge recognizes the distinction that linguists now usually make between 'Austronesian', as the name of the entire language family, and 'Malayo-Polynesian', as the name for a putative subgroup that includes all Austronesian languages except those of Formosa.

[^5]: It should be stressed that the genetic comparative method is not a discovery procedure that automatically yields correct interpretations of linguistic comparisons. There are invariably ambiguities in the evidence that require choice between two or more hypotheses. The method works best when (a) the number of putative cognate sets is large, (b) the witnesses (languages compared) have had little or no contact for a long time, (c) the number of such independent witnesses in the family is large, (d) the witnesses at each level fall into more than two subgroups.

[^6]:   The version of POLLEX (= [Biggs 1993](../references.md#source-Biggs1993)) used here, in fact, dates from 1990.

[^7]:   Obsolete term, cited by [Ferrell](../references.md#source-Ferrell1969) ([1969](../references.md#source-Ferrell1969):42, 247); the only reported cognate in a Formosan witness.

[^8]: See [Pawley and Green](../references.md#source-PawleyandGreen1973) ([1973](../references.md#source-PawleyandGreen1973)), Green (1991 b) for the terms 'Near Oceania' and 'Remote Oceania'.

[^9]: _b_ for expected _p_, possibly borrowed from a Polynesian source.

[^10]: Obsolete ([Hornell 1936](../references.md#source-Hornell1936):302).

[^11]:  The fruit of the putty nut (Parinarium laurinum) is widely used to caulk or stop a vessel. In Proto Huon Gulf an identical term is reconstructable both for the nut and the glue that is made from it: Proto Huon Gulf _&ast;jimiR_ 'putty nut, caulking substance' ([Ross 1988](../references.md#source-Ross1988):79); Tami _jim_ 'caulking substance'; Tuam _zimir_ 'caulk'; Numbami _dimil-a_ 'caulk'. The following set is of uncertain relation to _&ast;jimiR_: POc _&ast;jema_ 'caulk' ([Milke 1968](../references.md#source-Milke1968)): Motu _dema-ia_ 'caulk'; E. Fijian _sema_ 'splice, join, patch', _sema-ta_ 'to splice, join, patch s.t.'

[^12]: Gedaged _g_ for expected zero.

[^13]:   Also called _tau ihu_ vs _tau rapa_ 'carved ornament on stern'.

[^14]: Gloss dubious. Probably should be 'outrigger float'.

[^15]: See [Pawley](../references.md#source-Pawley1973) ([1973](../references.md#source-Pawley1973): 172).

[^16]: Paul Geraghty (pers.comm.) argues that the POc form was _&ast;katae_, and that the form _&ast;katea_ is a PPn innovation which has been borrowed by a few other languages.

[^17]: According to [Best](../references.md#source-Best1925) ([1925](../references.md#source-Best1925): 183), the term _ra kautu_ [=_raa kautuu_] refers to a (triangular) sail with mast that is stepped upright in a cupped boss on the floor of the dugout.

## 1. Plant part terms in modern Oceanic languages


This chapter treats the terms used by Proto Oceanic (POc) speakers to denote parts of plants.[^1] It complements the chapters that follow, which deal with plant names.

For presentation purposes plant part temtinologies are divided into the following twelve categories:

- • stems of woody plants
- • stems of non-woody plants, leaves and flowers
- • branches
- • roots
- • leaves
- • shoots, sprouts and suckers
- • flowers
- • fruits
- • seeds
- • outer coverings (bark, skin, husk)
- • sap or gum
- • thorns

Table 4.1    Some terms for parts of the coconut in Tikopia ([Firth 1985](../references.md#source-Firth1985))
famatua      (N) Mature coconut frond. Used traditionally for important taboo sign on vere
(Barringtonia) or voia (Canarium)       only by chiefs.
faiJOŋO     (N) Coconut shell (used dried as a receptacle, grater, fuel to kindle fire, source of
tattooing black pigment).
kaka        (N) Fibre of base of coconut palm (not sago palm) used traditionally to make filter
sheet in turmeric extraction, bag for flour etc.
pararafa     (N) Stem of coconut frond, used traditionally to provide small stirrer for liquids, tiny
mallet in tattooing; also used ritually in healing, smoothing temple sand etc.
puru         (N) Husk, primarily of coconut (puru niu), since no other palm nut husk of economic
interest; a fibrous dense material used as fuel or for domestic purposes such as clean-
ing wooden bowls, but mainly as lashing or after special treatment, for preparation of
sinnet cord.
roro         (N) Bud or shoot of coconut palm near flower bract; masticated with lime and betel
leaf when areca nut scarce. Also possibly other buds.
sakilo      (N) Immature coconut leaf, of pale colour; used traditionally as decoration for some
ritual objects, as a shelf in Resiake temple, or sign of taboo on orchard.
taume       (N) Spathe or sheathing-leaf of flower of coconut palm; when dry used for fuel. Tra-
ditionally supplied fire for the ritual dancing in Marae.

It is not claimed that such categories are necessarily salient in Oceanic societies, but they are based to some extent on the lexical distinctions found in modern Oceanic languages. For example, the category 'stems of woody plants' is based on the fact that a number of modern Oceanic languages appear to have distinct terms for woody and non-woody plant stems (e.g. Wayan gai 'woody stem or trunk of a shrub or tree' vs. kasa 'stem of a shrub or small plant, leaf-stalk or petiole stem of a leaf, flower or fruit'). The single category 'outer coverings' , including meanings such as bark, skin or peel and husk, is based on the fact that many Oceanic languages appear to have one term that denotes the outer covering of fruits (peel, rind) and of stems (bark, soft leaf-like skin). For example, Wayan taba can refer to any sort of outer covering or layer, including the bark of a tree and the rind or husk offruit. For each of these twelve categories Oceanic languages tend to have a general term, though this is not the case in all languages. Thus, while Oceanic languages tend to have a single term that can refer to the outer covering of different parts of a plant, there are languages in which there is no such general term, but rather several terms with a much narrower semantic range. For example, Nduke has three specific terms: tutupa- 'bark of a tree ', poko- 'husk or covering of grain' and pululu 'cover of fruit found on some palms ', but does not appear to have a general term that refers to all outer coverings of plants. Languages which do have a general term for a particular category may also have more specific terms within the category, as we see in the cases of Wayan and Tikopia in [§2.1](#s-2-1).

Modern Oceanic languages also tend to have terms for parts of particular types of plants, usually those which are of some cultural or economic importance. Thus in Tikopia there is a term,Jen, that denotes turmeric roots, reflecting their importance as the source of turmeric pigment (reŋa) that was traditionally used for the decoration of people and objects and was a highly valued item ([Firth 1985](../references.md#source-Firth1985): 393-394). In Wayan there is a specific term for the sap of the kauri tree, a tree which does not actually grow in Waya Island, but whose sap is important for the glazes of pots ([Pawley & Sayaba 2003](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003)). The cultural importance of the parts of particular kinds of plants that are labelled in Oceanic languages can be shown by the names and uses of different parts of the coconut palm in Tikopia, given in Table 4.1.

```

As the same types of plants are often culturally and economically important in Oceanic so- cieties, languages tend to have specific plant pant terms for the same types of plants, including coconuts, bananas, pandanus, breadfruit, yams and taros. For example, ([Ross 1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 183-185) reconstructs &ast;pudi as a general term for bananas in POc and a number of terms that denoted particular types of bananas. Alongside terms for types of bananas modern Oceanic languages tend to have terms for certain parts of the !banana plant, such as the suckers, flowers and bunches of fruit as demonstrated by Table 4.2.

The remainder of this chapter examines the terms for the parts of plants (both general and specific) which can be reconstructed for POc. The chapter is organised using the twelve categories listed above, each section beginning with some comments on the way in which the semantic category is lexified in modern Oceanic languages. Data from three languages, Nduke (MM), Wayan Fijian and Tikopia (Pn) are presented to demonstrate the lexical dis- tinctions that occur in modern Oceanic languages, before the probable POc lexemes and their meanings are discussed.

In many modern Oceanic languages part-whole relationships, including the parts of plants, are expressed by direct possessive constructions, such that the nominal denoting the part takes the possessive suffixes. For example, in the Kwaio (SES) phrase !ama-na ʔai 'the tree's flow- ers', the nominal lama- 'flower' takes the 3sG possessive suffix -na indexing the person and number of the whole (i.e. the tree) of which it is a part ([Keesing 1985](../references.md#source-Keesing1985): 107). Part-whole re- lationships were probably expressed by the same type of construction in POc, and so many of the nominals denoting the parts of plants that are reconstructed here would have often (or always) occurred with a possessive suffix.

## 2. Plant part terms reconstructable for POc


The main stems or trunks of woody plants are of considerable importance within Oceanic societies for the construction of houses and other buildings, and canoes, as well as for mak- ing bowls and various other wooden artefacts. [Ivens](../references.md#source-Ivens1927) ([1927](../references.md#source-Ivens1927): 149-150, 375-377) describes the construction of and materials used for houses and canoes on Mala Island in the southeastern Solomon Islands, including the use of two types of hardwood trees, hata and mamahu?e, for the posts which support the ridgepole of houses, and another two hardwood trees, mawa and iota, for the keel and hull of canoes, respectively. 2 Woods would have had equal importance in POc society in building houses (vol.1, ch.3), and making household artefacts (vol.1, ch.4) and canoes (vol.1, ch.7). For example, Green & Pawley (vol.1, ch.3, [§3.4](#s-3-4)) reconstruct three POc terms that referred to the posts of a house, namely &ast;aRiRi 'post', &ast;turu(s) 'post' and &ast;bou '(?) main bearers supporting raised floor or roof structure, or centre post supporting ridge pole', and based on ethnographic evidence such posts were likely constructed from the trunks of hardwood trees.

## 2.1. Stems of woody plants


Many modern Oceanic languages have a general term denoting the main stem or trunk of a woody plant, alongside a number of more specific terms relating to woody stems (see Table 4.3). 3 For example, Wayan gai 'woody stem or trunk of a shrub or tree' and Tikopia kuaŋa 'waist; trunk' are general terms that are used alongside more specific ones denoting different sections of a trunk, such as Wayan gina 'base of a tree-trunk or woody stem', ŋau 'main or centre section of trunk' and golo 'top section of a tree trunk or a woody stem'. Modem Oceanic languages typically also have terms for different kinds of wood within a tree trunk. Thus Tikopia has a contrast between tai, the heartwood or dense inner wood of a tree trunk and kanofi, the sapwood or soft outer layers of wood between the heartwood and the bark, while Nduke has a specific term, lolaŋa, for the soft inner part of palms or pandanus.

An apparently general term for tree trunk can be reconstructed for POc, namely &ast;pata(ŋ). It seems likely that POc &ast;pata(ŋ) referred to the main stem of plants denoted by &ast;kayu 'tree or shrub'. As mentioned in ch.3 ([§4.3](#s-4-3)) palms were probably not considered to be &ast;kayu by POc speakers, but there is no evidence to suggest that the trunks of palms were labelled differently from the trunks of woody trees. Palm trunks seem to be of considerable importance for construction in Oceanic societies, although the different properties of palm trunks and trunks of woody plants may result in different uses.

POc &ast;pata(ŋ) is not reflected widely in modern languages, and has been replaced by in- novative forms in most.

As mentioned above, Oceanic languages have terms denoting different parts of woody stems. POc &ast;puqu(n) denoted the base or bole of a woody stem and apparently also 'base' more generally, including the base or source of other concrete items and more abstractly the base, source or origin of stories etc.[^5]

Terms with similar meanings to Wayan ŋau 'main or centre section of trunk' and golo 'top section of a tree trunk or of woody stem' are more difficult to reconstruct. The POc body part term &ast;qulu- 'head' may also have denoted the top part or crown of a tree including the foliage, as such a meaning is reflected in a few widely scattered modern languages. In some Nuclear Polynesian languages the terms for the top of a tree look to be a reduced compound of &ast;kayu 'tree' and &ast;qulu 'head' (e.g. Maori kauru 'the head of a tree' ). However, it is possible that reflexes of &ast;qulu denoting the crown of a tree represent the independent extension of a body part term, particularly as in Takia (North New Guinea) many of the terms for plant parts appear to primarily denote body parts. For example, ai pata-n 'sap (lit. tree its kidney)' , ai lua-n 'tree trunk (lit. tree its stomach)' and ai sukulo-n 'bark (lit. tree its skin)'. Of note, however, is that in Takia the body part term 'head' is gurma-, and the reflex of POc &ast;qulu is restricted to denoting the top part of a tree.

A term specifically denoting the centre or main part of the trunk does not appear to be reconstructable for POc.

Terms for different types of wood or tissue in woody stems are present in Wayan, Tikopia and Nduke. Tikopia tai denotes the heartwood or dense inner wood of a tree trunk and kanofi the sapwood or soft outer layers of wood b1;:tween the heartwood and the bark. PPn terms for these two types of wood are reconstructable. The cognate set of Tongan tahi, Samoan taia and Tikopia tai attest to PPn &ast;tahi '(heart)wood' (POLLEx), but I have not found any non-Polynesian cognates of this form. A corresponding term for sapwood, &ast;taitea, is recon- structable for PNPn only and is a compound of &ast;tai 'heartwood' and &ast;tea 'white'. Again I have found no non-Polynesian cognates.

## 2.2. Stems of non-woody plants


Modem Oceanic languages also often have one or two terms denoting the stems of leaves and sometimes of non-woody plants. For example, Wayan baba 'stalk or stem of leaves of certain large-leafed plants, especially stem of taro, banana, coconut' and Tikopia fa 'leaf stem of a fleshy plant'. Table 4.4 gives the range of terms for non-woody stems that occur in Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia.

POc seems to have had a general term &ast;baRa-baRa that referred to stems of non-woody plants, like taros and bananas, and it seems likely that this form was also used to refer to the soft stem of leaves. Other POc terms for non-woody stems are more specifically either fruit stems or leaf stems and are described in the following sections.

POc &ast;baRa-baRa is a well-supported reconstruction, both in terms of form and meaning. Since widespread reflexes are reduplicated, unreduplicated forms in Micronesian languages are assumed to represent an innovation (see als:o discussion of POc &ast;paRara in footnote 21 of ch.9, p.280).

## 2.3. Branches


Table 4.5 gives terms for branches in Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia. Nduke has a term kapaha- that denotes branches of any plant, alongside a couple of more specific terms, VUŋU- 'a branch or stem bearing nut clusters or fruit' and buru- 'the fruiting branch (VUŋU-) of coconuts or

that is plentiful, producing many nuts.
VUŋU-        A branch or stem bearing fruit, e.g. a bunch of coconuts or betel nut or bananas still

canarium trees'. Wayan and Tikopia, on the other hand, have terms for large major branches and smaller minor branches. Thus Tikopia maŋa 'major branch' versus ra 'stem, twig, minor branch'. A number of different terms for branches are also reconstructable for POc, but the functional differences between them are not so clear.

Three apparently different, but quite similar, forms can be reconstructed with the meaning 'branch' for POc, namely &ast;raqan, &ast;rako(q) and &ast;raga(q). On the basis of the modern reflexes it is not clear what the functional differences among these terms would have been. Each of these POc forms reflects an older Austronesian term, but the differences in meaning among them at earlier stages are also unclear.

Proto Austronesian &ast;daqan 'branch', continued as POc &ast;raqan 'branch (of a tree)', is the most widely reflected 'branch' term in Oceanic languages. POc &ast;raqan was probably the general term for branches of trees and other plants as the meanings in modern languages denote both major branches of trees and small branches or twigs.

POc also had two morphologically related forms &ast;saŋa and &ast;ma-saŋa that denoted branch- ing or forked structures. POc &ast;saŋa, a reflex of PMP &ast;saŋa 'bifurcation, to branch', appears to have been a nominal form referring to a fork in a tree or stick, as well as the crotch. The verbal reflex in Kosraean seems to be an innovation.

POc &ast;ma-saŋa is reconstructed with both verbal and nominal functions. Its morphological structure, that is, the prefix &ast;ma-, suggests that it was an intransitive verb with an Undergoer subject, as it appears to still be in Lou, Lau, Arosi and Sye. However, the range of reflexes of &ast;ma-saŋa with nominal meanings in modern Oceanic languages suggests that it perhaps also had nominal uses in POc. A number of modern languages which reflect both &ast;saŋa and &ast;ma- saŋa support the reconstruction of nominal and verbal functions, respectively. For example, in Lau and Arosi reflexes of &ast;saŋa now have quite specific nominal meanings and reflexes of &ast;ma-saŋa have the general meaning of 'branching, forked' and look to be verbal. In Kwaio, on the other hand, the reflexes of both &ast;saŋa and &ast;ma-saŋa have nominal meanings.

PPn &ast;maŋa 'branch, fork; branching, forked' is a well-supported reconstruction. A possi- ble non-Polynesian cognate is Kiribati mwtiŋa 'branch, limb of tree ', but [Harrison](../references.md#source-Harrison1994) ([1994](../references.md#source-Harrison1994): 345) suggests that this may be a Polynesian loan. It is possible that PPn &ast;maŋa 'branch, fork' is historically related to POc &ast;ma-saŋa 'to be branching, branch' with irregular loss of &ast;s, but this is not certain. Most Polynesian languages reflect one or other form, but not both. How- ever, Niuean reflects both forms and with very similar meanings, and in Tongan both forms have similar nominal meanings, but the reflex of &ast;maŋa also has a verbal meaning.

Blust (ACD) also reconstructs Proto Austronesian &ast;paŋa 'fork of a branch; any forked structure, bifurcation' (which is reflected in Roviana as paŋa 'fish spear with several prongs'), and &ast;paŋaq 'forked, pronged, birfurcation', which appears not to have Oceanic reflexes. Blust (ACD) reconstructs Proto Austronesian &ast;taŋay 'branch', and a possible irregular reflex in Sa'a, akeake 'a strand of rope, a twig, a sprig', suggests the reconstruction of POc &ast;take 'small branch, twig', but it is not well-supported.


<a id="s-2-4"></a>
## 2.4. Roots


Oceanic languages tend to have a term for roots of plants in general and a number of more specific terms for kinds of roots such as buttress roots, aerial roots, taproot, fine hair-like roots. For example, we see from Table 4.6 that Nduke has a general term for roots ayara-, alongside doyoro- 'aerial roots' and bayere·· 'buttress roots'. Another NW Solomonic lan- guage, Maringe, on the other hand, appears to lack a general term for roots but distinguishes between bakla 'buttress roots', grabu 'small underground roots', glathi 'taproot of trees or tubers', and grebu 'short hair-like roots' .

Besides a general term for roots, &ast;wakaR-, POc had at least three other more specific terms, &ast;lali(t,c) 'buttress roots', &ast;Ramut 'fine, hair-like roots' and &ast;waka(t) 'mangrove roots' . POc &ast;wakaR is a well-supported reconstruction with reflexes in a wide range of Oceanic languages.

Blust associates Label wakir with PCEMP &ast;wakir 'kind of root'. However, there being no other Oceanic reflexes of this etymon, it seems likely that this is an irregular reflex of &ast;wakaR. Some Micronesian languages including Marshallese ɔkar, Chuukese war, wara-n, Carolinian _wār_ and Woleaian _wexaẓ_  point to a PMic variant _&ast;wakara-_ ([Bender et al. 2003](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003): 104), pre- sumably inalienably possessed and reflected in Chuukese wara-n.[^8]

Blust (ACD) also reconstructs a PEMP term &ast;wakaR-i 'root', which is reflected in anum- ber of Oceanic languages. Although Blust (ACD) posits an apparent morpheme boundary between the root &ast;wakaR and an ending &ast;-i, he comments that the morphology of the longer form remains obscure, and does not suggest any meaning difference between &ast;wakaR and &ast;wakaR-i. It was probably an altemant inalienably possessed form.[^9]

[Dempwolff](../references.md#source-Dempwolff1938) ([1938](../references.md#source-Dempwolff1938)) reconstructs PMP &ast;aka(r) 'root' as a doublet of &ast;wakaR 'root'. Blust (ACD) notes that all non-Oceanic cognates with an initial &ast;a- are in languages which regularly lose word-initial &ast;w-, thus providing no evidence for the presence or absence of &ast;w-. Several Oceanic languages have forms which do suggest a POc doublet form &ast;aka(r,R). None of the forms below are regular reflexes of &ast;wakaR 'root'.

Thus POc apparently had three very similar forms, &ast;wakaR, &ast;wakaRi- and &ast;aka(r,R), all 'root'. If &ast;wakaRi- is an altemant inalienably possessed form, then only &ast;aka(r,R) requires explanation. No modern languages have been found to retain more than one of the four forms, suggesting that there was no semantic difference among them. POc &ast;wakaR 'root' is the most widely reflected in modern Oceanic languages and reflects a Proto Austronesian form.

The POc term for 'buttress roots' was &ast;lali(c,t). This is a more or less regular reflex of PMP &ast;dalij, reconstructed by Blust (ACD ). The expected POc initial liquid is t&ast;r-, but it has undergone assimilation to the intervocalic liquid, giving &ast;Ia!- rather that t&ast;ral-. The same change is found in POc &ast;lalom 'inside', reflecting PMP &ast;Dalem (vol.2, ch.8, [§2.3.1](#s-2-3)). The expected final consonant is POc &ast;-c. The only languages to reflect a final consonant are Tolai and Ramoaaina, in both of which the expected reflex is zero, but instead we find -t.

The POc reconstruction &ast;Ramut 'fine, hair-like roots' is a revision of [Geraghty's](../references.md#source-Geraghty1990) ([1990](../references.md#source-Geraghty1990): 69) PEOc reconstruction &ast;Ramu- 'hair, fibre'.[^10] Extra data suggest that this form had a primary meaning 'hair-like roots' and in a number of languages has been extended to refer to other fine fibrous things. Data from the Meso-Melanesian languages support the reconstruction of a final consonant in POc. In Papuan Tip languages &ast;Ramut appears to have become the general term for roots.

Finally, there is some evidence that POc also had a term that denoted mangrove roots. Blust (ACD) reconstructs PMP &ast;wakat 'mangrove root' along with a possible doublet &ast;waket. He notes that the loss of final consonants in most Oceanic languages makes it difficult to distinguish between reflexes of PMP &ast;wakaR 'root' and &ast;wakat 'mangrove root', but states that close attention to semantics suggests thalt only &ast;wakaR 'root' survived in POc. Although I have found no reflexes of &ast;wak[a,e]t in Oceanic languages which retain word-final con- sonants, the presence of both &ast;wakaR 'roots (in general)' and &ast;wako(t) 'mangrove root' in POc is suggested by the apparently distinct reflexes in Kosraean, namely nknk 'mangrove root' and okce '(N) root'; (vi) 'begin to have roots '. Tawala wakoya 'mangrove' supports the reconstruction of POc &ast;wako(t) with an &ast;o, reflecting PMP &ast;waket.

In English 'mangrove' refers to a variety of trees and shrubs that grow in coastal swamps and tidal estuaries and are characterised by their ability to tolerate salt water and their posses- sion of different forms of aerial roots (OED). Species of the genus Rhizophora which grow in the wetter outer areas of the mangrove swamp have interlacing prop-roots, whereas those of the genus Bruguiera tend to grow in drie:r areas with pneumatophores (breathing roots) projecting upward above the surface of the mud. Non-Oceanic cognates suggest that PMP &ast;wak[a,e]t 'mangrove root' probably referred to the prop-roots of Rhizophora mangroves. A few Western Malaya-Polynesian reflexes specifically denote prop-roots of mangroves and Central Malaya-Polynesian reflexes, which mostly refer to the mangrove tree rather than the root, tend to denote Rhizophora mangroves too. Thus it seems likely that POc &ast;wako(t) also referred to the prop-roots of Rhizophora mangroves and not simply the aerial roots of man- groves in general. Ross (ch.6, [§2.1](#s-2-1)) suggests that POc &ast;wako(t) may also have served as a generic term for Rhizophora, citing the glosses below which refer to the tree and not just the roots.

## 2.5. Leaves


As well as a general term for leaf, Oceanic languages tend to have more specific terms refer- ring either to leaves of particular kinds of plants, leaves at different stages of growth, and/or parts of leaves. For example, Wayan has a general term rau, three terms that specifically denote coconut leaves sasa, basilele and tOrau, a term that refers to dry banana or pandanus leaves, susuluka, a term for young leaves, belebele, and two terms for the midrib of a leaf, tua and tuabou. Table 4.7 gives the different terms for leaves from Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia.

A generic term for leaf, POc &ast;raun, is clearly reconstructable and reflects an earlier Proto Austronesian term with a similar meaning. As some reflexes of &ast;raun denote hair or fur, it seems likely that in POc &ast;raun referred not only to broad surface leaves, but also to the needle-like leaves of casuarinas, but the glosses of most reflexes are not specific enough to determine if this is the case.

More specific leaf terms are not so easily reconstructable for POc. Modem languages tend to have a number of terms denoting the leaves of different types of plants. Table 4.8 shows the different leaf terms in Iduna (PT), Arosi (SES), Anejom (SV) and Niuean (Pn). As well as representing different regions of Oceania, these languages seem representative of the different ways leaf terms are lexicalised. Some languages, like Iduna, have distinct terms for the leaves of each of a number of different plants, including coconut, pandanus, sago, taro and tobacco. These include terms for leaves used for different purposes. The Niuean dictionary, on the other hand, lists a number of terms for different leaves, but they are mostly compounds containing the general term for leaf, _lau_. Thus _launiu_, comprising _lau_ 'leaf' and niu 'coconut' denotes 'coconut frond ', laufa consisting of !au 'leaf' andfa 'pandanus' de- notes pandanus leaf' and laumamanu comprising lau 'leaf' and mamanu 'a common fern, Phymatodes scolopendria' denotes 'fern leaves '.

Anejom is in between these two extremes with some compound terms, such as neri- neafi 'coconut frond' comprising neri- 'leaf' and neafi 'coconut', neri-neto 'sugarcane leaf' consisting of neri- 'leaf' and neto 'sugarcane', and nerintal 'taro-leaf' consisting of neri- 'leaf' and intal 'taro (generic)', and some distinct, synchronically unanalysable, lexical items for different leaf types, such as nilev 'dry coconut-leaf used in making house-walls', nevak 'dry pandanus leaf ready for weaving' and narico 'leaf of sugarcane or wild cane (white and itchy)'. Other terms in Anejom, such as inmatinyat 'dry fallen pandanus leaf' and inmatito 'dry leaves of sugarcane' are compounds consisting of inmati- 'dry leaf of' and contracted forms of the plant names; inmati8ve 'dry coconut leaf looks to be a similar compound al- though the second element is not clear. For other languages there are only a few leaf terms that denote leaves of specific kinds of plants. For example, Arosi has terms for the leaves of coconut, pandanus and taro.

<a id="p-106"></a>

Also of note is that many languages have distinctive labels for leaves of the same sets of plants. So the languages in Table 4.8 all have names for coconut fronds, for pandanus leaves, and for taro leaves, while with other types of plants, such as betel pepper or sago, only one or two of the languages have specific terms. It is apparent that the types of leaves which have distinctive names in a language are those which have some cultural use or other sig- nificance. Thus many Oceanic languages have several terms for coconut leaves, apparently reflecting the different uses of different growth stages of them within Oceanic societies. [Firth](../references.md#source-Firth1985) ([1985](../references.md#source-Firth1985): 92-293) writes of the great variety of uses of parts of a coconut palm in Tikopia, in- cluding 'fresh leaves for floor mats (tapakau) and rough baskets (popora); dry leaves for torches (afi); and immature leaves (sakilo) for decoration'. Lewo has three terms that denote coconut leaves, namely mamaru 'leaf of coconut (green)', masuge 'coconut leaf dry' and pu- rukupi 'coconut frond', distinguishing between green and dry coconut leaves. This distinction is one that is often lexicalised in Oceanic languages. Thus Wayan basilele 'coconut leaf, dry or green' versus sasa 'dry coconut leaf, Lou lien 'unopened coconut leaf versus suZan 'dry coconut leaf and Chuukese payiri 'coconut leaf and wupwut 'young coconut leaf (still light in colour)'. In other languages, such as Takia, the different terms for coconut leaves seem to directly reflect different uses, thus bombom 'coconut leaves (used for roofing)' and luŋ 'co- conut leaf (used for perpetual fire)'. The significance of the terms for dry coconut leaves also seems to be related to usage, for torches (e.g. Ramoaaina ulu 'leaf of coconut palm, (coconut leaf) torch ') or for various woven items, including mats, baskets and the roofing and walls of houses (e.g. Manam rigina 'coconut fronds (plaited), used as mats and roofing and siding for houses', Lukep sal 'coconut leaf fence/enclosure' and Sursurunga her 'coconut leaf; mat made from coconut leaf).

Pandanus leaves are often more important than coconut leaves for weaving in Oceanic societies. [Firth](../references.md#source-Firth1985) ([1985](../references.md#source-Firth1985): 105-106, 186) describes the use of the leaves of different types of pandanus for weaving in Tikopia. Thus the leaves of fara 'pandanus, narrow stiff leaves, single tall trunk' are used for coarse mats and sewing coconut fibre bags and the leaves of kie 'pandanus (sp. similar to Pandanus odoratissimus)' are used for fine mats. However, it seems that languages tend to only have a single term for pandanus leaves, if they have one at all. The situation with sago leaves is somewhat similar. Most dictionaries have terms which denote sago leaf thatch, and sago leaves are clearly the most used leaf for making thatch amongst Oceanic societies, but a term for sago leaves is found in only a scattering of languages (e.g. Titan kaliŋat 'sago leaf (shingles)', Mapos Buang ngemŋ 'sago leaves (used for making grass skirts)', Mangap ram 'new leaves of sago (used for decoration)' and Tolo hatsira 'sago palm leaf).

Names for types of taro leaves, on the other hand, are apparently distinguished in Oceanic languages on the basis of their value as food. For instance, Kaulong has three terms pasu 'taro leaf (mature)', sulak 'taro leaf (young)' and talan 'taro leaves that are not suitable for eating' . In other languages there will be a single term £or taro leaves (e.g. Arosi bʷara 'leaf of taro' and Drehet moruŋ 'taro leaf).


<a id="p-107"></a>

How many terms for specific types of leaves can be reconstructed for POc? Across the languages in Table 4.8 it can be seen that not many of the terms are cognate. Thus while all the languages have terms for coconut and taro leaves, none of the terms are cognate. This is in part not unexpected as the terms in Table 4.8 often refer to coconut leaves of different growth stages. So while Anejom has terms for dry coconut leaves, one of the Arosi terms and the Niuean term denote coconut leaves in general. But even looking at just the terms for dry coconut leaves in Table 4.8, there are still no forms that are cognate (e.g. Iduna tafa '(dry) coconut leaves used as torch', Arosi btHOŋa 'dry coconut leaf, Anejom inmati8ve 'dry coconut leaf and nilev 'dry coconut-leaf used in making house-wall'). Table 4.8 seems to typify a general trend across Oceanic languages, such that while languages have terms with similar meanings they are not often cognate. Certain terms associated with coconut fronds are nonetheless reconstructable, and their meaning also includes a function for which they are used: POc &ast;sulu(q) 'dry coconut leaf torch; dry coconut leaf and POc &ast;ramaR 'coconut leaf used as a torch when fishing' (ch.12, [§5.1.2](#s-5-1)), and POc &ast;no(k,g)o 'midrib or spine of coconut leaflet; broom made therefrom' (ch.12, [§5.1.3](#s-5-1)).

Pandanus and sago leaves were apparently as important as coconut leaves in many tra- ditional Oceanic societies. A POc term &ast;qatop 'thatch, roof can be reconstructed (see vol.1, ch.3, [§3.4](#s-3-4)), with reflexes in many languages that refer specifically to sago-leaf thatch. In SE Solomonic and North-Central Vanuatu languages reflexes of this term denote the sago palm, as well as sago-leaf thatch. In Arosi that ao 'sago palm' can refer to the leaves is evident from compounds such as adodo ao 'to lay together the leaves in bundles', susuʔi ao 'layers of sewn leaves put ready for thatching' and taba ao "to go out and cut sago palm leaves'. However, reflexes of POc &ast;qatop that refer specifically to sago palm leaves are not widespread, and so unlike POc &ast;sulu(q), a secondary 'leaf meaning does not appear to be reconstructable. In fact, there does not seem to have been a distinctive term for sago leaves, although a number of modern languages do have such terms. The same is true for pandanus leaves. They ap- pear to be much used for weaving in many negions of Oceania and known for finer weaving than coconut leaves, but a distinctive term does not appear to be reconstructable for POc. [Bender et al.](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003): 52) reconstruct a Proto Micronesian form &ast;maŋU 'pandanus leaf, but the etymology of this form is unclear. [Geraghty](../references.md#source-Geraghty1990) ([1990](../references.md#source-Geraghty1990): 64) suggests it is a reflex of POc &ast;maRaŋo 'to be dry, withered', supported by the formal correspondence and the fact that in a number of Micronesian languages the meanings are restricted to dry pandanus leaves and in Ponapean mcŋ has the meaning 'withered, dry, dead vegetation'. Ross (ch.ll, [§2.5](#s-2-5)) suggests that Marshallese mtiŋ 'pandanus leaves', Chuukese maŋ 'pandanus leaf, especially when softened by a shell' and Woleaian maŋi 'pandanus leaf are reflexes of POc &ast;mʷaŋa 'Pandanus sp., perhaps Pandanus conoideus' supported by Kosraean mʷeŋ 'pandanus'. It seems likely that there has been a conflation of these two POc terms in Proto Micronesian. Ross reconstructs several POc terms for different types of pandanus and it is possible that these terms could be used to refer to the leaves as well as the tree, especially as only the leaves of certain kinds of pandanus would have been valued for weaving.

POc &ast;gal(a,o) 'taro leaves' is tentatively neconstructed by Ross (this volume, ch.9, [§2.2.1](#s-2-2)), supported by the cognate set below.

[Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 175) also reconstructs POc &ast;was(i,a) 'edible greens, Abelmoschus manihot (syn. Hibiscus manihot)' that apparently denoted edible green leaves, as well as the most salient member of the class, Abelmoschus manihot.


<a id="s-2-6"></a>
## 2.6. Shoots, sprouts and suckers


As can be seen from Table 4.9 Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia all have several terms for the new growth of plants. Wayan, for example, has ouli 'sucker of plant', so 'young, tender leaves at the top of a plant', gau 'suckers', tubu 'new growth, young shoot or sprout' and hebe 'suckers or shoots of taro or tobacco plant'. Wayan also has a more specific term, soba, that denotes banana suckers. Tikopia also has a number of general terms for the new growth of plants, and a term roro that specifically denotes the new growth of a coconut palm. In the data for Nduke, on the other hand, there are a number of general terms for suckers and shoots, but none that denote the new growth of particular kinds of plants only.

The number of terms for shoots and suckers in modern Oceanic languages reflects the importance of these parts in the propagation offood crops. [French-Wright](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983): 193) notes that taros, yams, bananas and breadfruit 'are fairly easily generated by means of suckers' and that 'today many daughter communities rarely use seeds, although the gourd, which is grown from seed, is an exception'. He also writes that 'the POc gardener probably relied to a large extent upon seedlings, cuttings and seed tubers for the propagation of food plants', and he reconstructs a number of POc terms that provide evidence for such horticultural practices.

The most general term for shoots or suckers in POc appears to have been &ast;[s,j]uli(q), reconstructed as &ast;suli(q) by [French-Wright](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983): 78). [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 179) reconstructs POc &ast;[s,j ]uti(q) with a general meaning of propagation material (e.g. cutting or shoot), as well as the more specific meaning of banana or taro shoot, as it is this more specific meaning that is reflected in many modern Oceanic languages. The Mota, Wayan and Tongan glosses suggest that this term could be used figuratively to refer to one' s children or offspring.

The initial consonant is uncertain because Manam and Tawala reflect &ast;sand not &ast;j, but Numbami, Lukep and Gela reflect &ast;j and not &ast;s. In the other languages the initial consonant reflects both &ast;sand &ast;j.

Nduke
kihe-        A sucker of a banana or taro, or pineapple tops, or the germinating fruits of goe 'sago'
or hea 'betelnut'. These have in common that these growing shoots are used for plant-

soyoyo       Newly growing flowering shoot of a palm tree, e.g. of a coconut or sago palm.
togo-        To germinate, of seeds, or 'newly shoot', of plants. A general word that can refer to
a germinating seed, a sucker (kihe} or any new leaf growth (liho). In a more general
sense, it can mean any growth occuring of a plant. This is the only word that applies
to germination of seeds.

[French-Wright](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983): 60) also reconstructs a very similar term with the meaning 'to trans- plant'. Again there is variation in the initial consonant with Roviana reflecting POc &ast;j and Arosi reflecting POc &ast;s. He suggests (1983: 61-62) that &ast;(sj)uli could be used in POc to denote the practice of growing taros from sucke:rs which are left in the ground when the ma- ture taro is harvested and then transplanted when a new garden has been prepared, and to the transplanting of fruit trees grown initially from seeds, but replanted to a carefully chosen spot when still small. However, the POc reconstruction with this meaning is not well supported, as it is reflected in only one NW Solomonic and one SE Solomonic language.

From the fact that modern languages tend to have several forms that denote new growth of plants, we would expect the same to be true of POc, but other terms with similar mean- ings are not easily reconstructable. However, there are two nominal terms which appear to be candidates. [Bender et al.](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003): 28) reconstruct Proto Oceanic &ast;qili 'sprout, shoot' sup- ported by reflexes in Micronesian languages and Nakanai. The combination of the lack of an initial consonant in the Micronesian languages and an initial h- in Nakanai support the reconstruction of an initial &ast;q in POc, and neither the Micronesian forms nor the Nakanai form are plausible reflexes of POc &ast;[s,j ]uti(q).

A third possible POc term for the new growth of plants is &ast;rama. This is not a very well- supported reconstruction, but is suggested by the Lou form rɔm ɔn 'taro shoot' and a few terms from North New Guinea languages, including Sissano (Arop) raman 'seedling, shoot, plant'. As Lou and Sissano (Arop) are not languages which reflect final consonants, it seems likely that the final -n in these languages reflects the 3sG possessive suffix.

Taro is propagated by planting either the tops of large corms or the small suckers which grow from the side of the corm, and POc &ast;up(e,a) denoted this planting material. Its reflexes sometimes denote propagation material for plants other than taro.

POc also appears to have had a couple of verbal terms that denoted new growth, including &ast;tupul 'to send out new growth' ([French-Wright 1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983): 78) and &ast;pʷer(e) 'to sprout, grow' (see vol.1, ch.5, [§9](#s-9) for the reconstruction of other terms denoting growth). 11

## 2.7. Flowers


Oceanic languages tend to have a general term that refers to blooms of any kind, like Nduke havoro 'the general term for flower' and Wayan se 'blossom, bloom, flower'. Some languages also have names for the flowers of specific type:s of plants, such as Tikopia kalokalo 'bright red flowers of coral tree (ŋatae 'Erythrina sp. ')' and viro 'sago flower'.

POc appears to have had two general tem1s for flower, &ast;puŋa, which continues PMP &ast;buŋa, and &ast;se, and it is not clear how they differed. Both forms are reflected most widely in Eastern Oceanic languages; in fact I have found no Western Oceanic cognates of &ast;puŋa and only one of &ast;se.

The Fijian, Polynesian and Nakanai forms below suggest the reconstruction of &ast;see 'flower' with a long vowel, but no contrast between short and long vowels is reconstructed for POc. Possibly the POc form was &ast;seqe as loss of &ast;q is a regular change in all the languages which reflect it. But this raises a further phonological question. POc &ast;e reflects PMP &ast;-ay which only occurred word-finally. It is possible that the first vowel of the POc form was not &ast;e, and that in Nakanai and Proto Central Pacific a sequence of unlike vowels, perhaps resulting from the loss of medial &ast;q, merged as ee. However, without further cognates, these comments are purely speculative and it can simply be noted that POc &ast;see 'flower' is a non-canonic form which may need revision if additional reflex1es are found .

A very similar form, &ast;sei, appears to be reconstructable for Proto Central Pacific, although the original meaning is not entirely obvious. In Fijian reflexes refer to the flower of the pan- danus and in Polynesian languages reflexes refer to flowers that are used as ornaments behind the ear or in the hair.

The generic terms for flowers in many Western Oceanic languages are innovative, and are not only not cognate with those found in Eastern Oceanic, but are also often not cognate within lower level subgroups.

Just as with leaf terms, modern Oceanic: languages tend to have one or two more spe- cific flower terms that denote the flowers of particular types of plants. So alongside se 'blos- som, flower ', Wayan has sei 'flower of the vadra pandanus' and waluwalu 'flower of the breadfruit'. Other languages tend to have specific names for coconut, sago or banana flow- ers (e.g. Misima ldmun 'coconut flower ', Ramoaaina tete 'flower of banana', Tikopia viro 'sago flower '). But again none of these more specific terms appear to be reconstructable for POc. Even within lower level subgroups languages have non-cognate forms. For example, the Papuan Tip languages Gapapaiwa (sisina 'coconut blossoms '), Gumawana (niyola 'blos- soms on a coconut palm') and Misima (ldmun 'coconut flower' ) have non-cognate terms for coconut flower.

'Canarium nuts'. Refers to the separate 'hands' of betelnut or bananas that have been
torn off from the full bunch.

## 2.8. Fruit


Table 4.11 gives the terms for 'fruit' and related meanings in Nduke, Wayan Fijian and Tikopia. All three languages have generic terms for fruit and specific terms relating to ba- nanas.

The term 'fruit' in English has a number of senses, including: '1. vegetable products in general, that are fit to be used as food by men and animals … 2. the edible product of a plant or tree, consisting of the seed and its envelope, esp. the latter when it is of juicy pulpy nature … . 5. the seed of a plant or tree regarded as the means of reproduction, together with its envelope' (OED). With terms glossed as 'fruit' in the dictionaries of Oceanic languages it is often difficult to determine which of the English senses are present in the meaning of the Oceanic term. [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 208-209) concludes that POc &ast;puaq, the general term for 'fruit', denoted fruit as a plant part and plant product, rather than a food category. The number of reflexes of &ast;puaq that are glossed as 'seed' suggests that its meaning encompassed both the seed and its envelope (see [§2.9](#s-2-9)).

POc &ast;jamu(qa,a), on the other hand, apparently referred to clusters of fruit, or flowers, on palms. This term is reflected with such a meaning in Kairiru, Rotuman and Rarotongan, but in other languages, such as Wayan and Tikopia, reflexes have come to denote the spathe or the covering of a coconut flower cluster. The addition of this latter meaning appears to be restricted to Central Pacific languages, and so is not reconstructed as a secondary meaning for the POc term. The Polynesian forms here are taken to be reflexes that have undergone metathesis ([Geraghty 1986](../references.md#source-Geraghty1986): 301).

## 2.9. Seeds


Table 4.12 gives the terms for 'seeds' in Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia. Nduke has a single term, kiko-, which is a general term for seeds or grain. Wayan, on the other hand, has a number of different terms, three of which, mata, gele and kawa, denote seeds in general, although with mata and kawa the seed of a plant is only one of a range of related meanings. Wayan also has a term nbou that denotes the seeds of mangrove trees.

'Seed' in English refers to 'the ovules of a plant or plants (chiefly, when in the form of 'grains' or small roundish bodies) esp[eciallly] as collected for the purpose of being sown' (OED), and can refer to a variety of objects, including the large stone-like seeds of some fruit, grains of grasses, beans, the scale-like seeds of pine cones etc. While many modern Oceanic languages have apparently monosemous terms glossed as 'seed', other languages have polysemous terms with primary meanings of 'stone', 'fruit' or 'louse egg'. POc appears to have been like these latter languages.


<a id="p-118"></a>

Wayan Fijian
mata    Something which is the focal point or most important part of s.t., e.g. eye of needle,

etc.
gele    Seed of a plant, pips or stones of fruit.
kawa    That which is reproduced by a plant or animal: seed, progeny, offspring, descendants,
stock.
tlbou   Seeds of mangrove (tiri or tol)o ).
Tikopia
koru     (N) Seed or kernel of large fruit, e.g. Areca. Also a dry breadfruit; and (mod.) ship's
biscuit.
fatufatu (N) Stone, rock; knob, knot, nodule, kernel (e.g. fatu kofe 'bamboo nodule' ,fatu kai
'melon, melon seed'); Parts of body, protuberant or kernel-like (e.g. knuckle, Adam's
apple etc).
nukuru (N) Dried kernel of areca nut, stored for betel chewing.
kaka     (N) Dry, woody areca nut, in late stage.
```

In a number of modern Oceanic languages, including Manam, Carolinian and Tikopia, reflexes of POc &ast;patu 'stone' are polysemous and can also refer to the seeds of plants. In other languages, such as Lukep, Marovo and Emae, reflexes of POc &ast;patu appear to have lost the 'stone' meaning and remain as distinct terms for 'seed'. While it is possible that the shift from the meaning 'stone' to that of 'seed' occurred independently in different groups of Oceanic languages, it seems probable that POc &ast;patu was polysemous and could denote both stones and the seeds of plants. The most natural polysemy of &ast;patu would have been 'stone' and 'large stone-like seeds'. The Lukep, Kiribati and Samoan reflexes suggest that &ast;patu may have also denoted small seeds such as those of melons and citrus fruits, but it is not clear if &ast;patu could refer to the seeds of all plants.

[Holzknecht](../references.md#source-Holzknecht1989) ([1989](../references.md#source-Holzknecht1989): 87) presents data from a number of Markham (NNG) languages to support the reconstruction of POc &ast;lija(n) 'se1ed', the primary meaning of which was probably 'nit, louse egg' ([Ross 1989b](../references.md#source-Ross1989b): 481-482). More detailed Oceanic data indicates that the POc form was &ast;lisaq 'nit, louse egg', reflecting an earlier PAn term &ast;liseqeS 'nit, louse egg' (Blust 2002), and that a second form, &ast;lejaŋ 'nit', is reconstructable for PWOc. Reflexes of POc &ast;lisaq 'nit, louse egg' with the meaning 'seed' occur in Sa'a (SES) and Wusi (NCV), so it is possible that this was a secondary meaning in PEOc. The exact reference of PEOc &ast;lisa 'seed' is unclear, but it probably denoted small seeds like grain at least, and may have referred more generally to the seeds of plants. The 'seed' meaning of reflexes of PWOc &ast;lejan in several Markham (NNG) languages, including Adzera niju-n 'seed' and N Watut nejo 'seed', indicate that a similar shift in meaning has also occurTed with reflexes of this form.

As noted in [§2.8](#s-2-8), POc &ast;puaq was another term that could refer to the seeds of a plant as part of a broader meaning that also encompassed 'fruit'. A number of Oceanic languages have a distinct term for the seeds of the breadfruit, but as can be seen from the following list, the modern terms are rarely cognate.

MM:     Ramoaaina      tat           'breadfruit seed'
SES:    Gela          dui           'breadfruit seed'

```

The data given by [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 188) allow the reconstruction of PWOc &ast;kalijo 'edible kernel of breadfruit segments', but no term with this meaning is reconstructable for POc.

The breadfruit is a syncarp, a compound fruit with many segments arranged around the core, which itself is the spike of the original flower. POc &ast;malo- denoted both the flower spike and the fruit core.

## 2.10. Outer coverings


This section looks at terms for the outer coverings of parts of plants, such as the bark of woody stems, rind or peel of fruits and husk or shell of nuts. In some modern Oceanic languages there is a general term that covers all such meanings. For example, in Wayan taba denotes any sort of outer covering or layer, including skin or hide, bark, rind or husk of fruit and the outer shell of things like eggs. Similar terms are found in other languages, such as Longgu pagepage 'bark; skin of snake or lizard; skin of an animal that sheds; skin that peels, of human; skin of fruit or tubers (e.g. cassava, sweet potato); any skin removed from " owner"', and Mumeng (Patep) nin;ɔVi 'skin, of person, animal, fruit, tree'. N duke, in contrast, has a number of quite specific terms, tutupa 'bark of tree', poko- 'the husk or covering of grain' and pululu 'the cover over fruit found on some palm trees'. Many languages, like Nduke and Tikopia, have specific terms for the husk of coconuts.

In many modern Oceanic languages the same word is used for skin (of animals and peo- ple), skin of fruit and bark (oftrees), e.g. Xaraciuu kii 'skin, hide; bark, peel (offruit)', Iduna kwajilina 'skin (of fruit, plants, animals); bark of tree ', Mangseng peti 'skin, peel, bark' and Labu anasɔ 'skin; bark; peel'. And this also appears to have been true of POc &ast;kulit. Also reconstructable for POc (and PMP) is a verbal derivative &ast;kulit-i-, with the transitive suffix &ast;-i, denoting the removal of skin or bark.

In Proto Remote Oceanic there is evidence for doublet forms &ast;kulit and &ast;kilit, with &ast;kilit reflected in Namakir of North Central Vanuatu, Western Micronesian languages and Poly- nesian languages. However, it is likely that these reflect independent developments in Proto Micronesian, Namakir and PPn.

```


<a id="s-2-11"></a>
## 2.11. Sap, resin


Table 4.14 gives the terms for sap or resin in Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia. Nduke appears to have a single term oto- 'the sap or gum of trees and some fruits'. Tikopia and Wayan, on the other hand, have several different terms. In Wayan toya denotes sap, especially when it's runny, bulei denotes sticky sap or gum, and makadre denotes the gum or resin of the kauri tree which is used for glazing pots.

The Oceanic data, shown in the cognate set below, suggest the reconstruction of POc &ast;butut, and perhaps of a variant POc &ast;bulit, referring to the sap of plants and other sticky substances. It was also apparently an Undergoer subject verb 'to be sticky' with a corre- sponding transitive form &ast;bulut-i- 'to stick something to something'. Reflexes of &ast;butut in a number of Oceanic languages have narrower meanings than that reconstructed for POc, denoting kinds of sap that have a particular purpose. For example, 'Are'are purui and Sa'a pulu denote the use of putty nut gum to caulk canoes. Samoan pulu also denotes the substance used for caulking, in this case, breadfruit sap, and Mota pulu and NE Ambae bulu denote the sap of the Canarium almond which is used for tattooing.

## 2.12. Thorns


As can be seen from Table 4.15 Wayan, Tikopia and Nduke all have a single term for the thorns of a plant.


<a id="p-125"></a>

```
Table 4.15      Terms for thorn in Nduke, Wayan Fijian and Tikopia
Nduke
robo- Thorns of a plant, e.g. lime tree thorns or Bougainvillea, and also sharply serrated
leaves.
Wayan Fijian
voto    1. Thorn, prickle. 2. Spike or spines of a fish, such as the sokisoki, Pufferfish. 3. Barb
or tail needle of a stingray. 4. Gooseflesh.
Tikopia
sina   (N) Thorn, spine.
```

Proto Austronesian &ast;Cenek 'thorn' (ACD) appears to be reflected within Oceanic only by the Bauan Fijian verb tono-ka 'to pierce, poke'. [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d): 189) reconstructs &ast;ruRi as the general term for thorns and spines in POc, noting that some reflexes (e.g. Lou and Lukep) refer specifically to the barbs of sago leaves and bark, and the Titan reflex to the sago plant itself. Reflexes of this term have only been found in Admiralty, North New Guinea and Papuan Tip languages. While Bilibil, Takia and Kis and Gapapaiwa reflect POc &ast;druRi, Numbami and Mapos-Buang and Iduna reflect &ast;ruRi, and the Admiralty forms are compatible with either &ast;ruRi or &ast;druRi .

[Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1976b) ([1976b](../references.md#source-Blust1976b)) reconstructs POc &ast;poto(k) 'thorn, barb of stingray'. However, while the 'thorn' meaning is well-supported, the 'stingray barb' meaning appears to be restricted to Central Pacific languages, and so may not have been present in POc.

<a id="p-126"></a>

In a number of languages terms for 'thorn' reflect POc terms that are best reconstructed with the meaning 'needle'. Thus POc &ast;saRum 'needle, tattooing needle (typically made from wing-bone of flying fox)' (vol.1, ch.4, [§3.2.1](#s-3-2)) is reflected in Carolinian tou-tow as the general term for thorns of plants. The same is true of the Sa'a reflex of POc &ast;sika 'netting needle' (vol.1, ch.8, [§2](#s-2)). [Milke](../references.md#source-Milke1961) ([1961](../references.md#source-Milke1961)) reconstructs &ast;sika for POc with the meaning 'netting needle, thorn', but the 'thorn' meaning appears to be reflected only in Sa'a sike 'thorn', suggesting that the original meaning was 'netting needle' and that the Sa'a form is innovative.


<a id="s-3"></a>
## 3. Concluding remarks


This chapter presents more than 40 POc reconstructions of terms that denote the parts of plants. In general the number and types of terms that are reconstructable for POc within each of the 12 semantic categories are similar to those found in modern Oceanic languages. For example, modern languages tend to have several terms that refer to the roots of plants, typically including a term for roots in general and a number of more specific terms denoting different types of roots. Similarly, for POc a general term for roots, &ast;wakaR, and several more specific terms, &ast;lali(t,c) 'buttress roots', &ast;Ramut 'fine, hair-like roots' and &ast;wako(t) 'mangrove (aerial) roots', can be reconstructed. The same is true for terms referring to outer coverings. POc &ast;kulit denoted the skin of fruits and the bark of trees, as well as the skin of animals and people. Alongside &ast;kulit, POc also had specific terms for coconut husk (&ast;punut, &ast;p(w)enut) and for the sheath of fibrous material around the base of a coconut frond (&ast;Runut, &ast;nuRut). Many modern Oceanic languages hav1;: similar types ofterms for outer coverings.

Modem Oceanic languages also tend to hav,e extensive terminologies for the parts of the coconut palm, its fruit and their uses (Table 4.1 ). Chapter 12 is devoted to this topic.

The number of general plant part terms reconstructed for POc, over 30, is similar to the numbers of such terms in Wayan (nearly 50), Tikopia (nearly 50) and Nduke (over 30). How- ever, these modern languages have a much larger number of terms for the parts of particular types of plants (nearly 20 in all three languages), than can be reconstructed for POc (7 terms in this chapter). This difference was particularly apparent with the terms for leaves. Table 4.8 gave a selection of the range of terms for leaves in a number of Oceanic languages, demon- strating how modern Oceanic languages typically have several terms for the leaves of par- ticular types of plants, including coconut, taro and pandanus. [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d)) reconstructs POc terms for taro leaves (&ast;gal(a,o)) and palm fronds (&ast;[pa]paq[a- ]), and POc &ast;sulu(q) 'coconut leaf torch' could probably also refer to dry coconut leaves, but other terms for the leaves of particular types of plants do not appear to be reconstructable.

Table 4.2 shows the range of terms in a number of modern languages for parts of banana plants. Many Oceanic languages, including Lou, Iduna, Gapapaiwa, Gumawana, Ramoaaina, Gela, Longgu, Wayan, and E Futunan, have tenms that specifically denote the new shoots or suckers of banana plants, but such a specific term does not appear to be reconstructable for POc. Rather, POc &ast;[s,j ]uli(q) apparently denote:d propagation material in general (including suckers and shoots), though it may have referred especially to the suckers of banana and taro. Modem Oceanic languages also tend to have more specific terms for bunches of bananas than can be reconstructed for POc. Thus Lou has a term pɔrɔk denoting a new bunch of bananas and several terms for hands of bananas, including topʷan 'first banana hand', 1prcn 'last hand of bananas', set 'one hand of bananas' and turet 'two hands of bananas'. For POc only the more general term &ast;qitiŋ 'hand of bananas' can be reconstructed.

It is unlikely that the structure and detail of the POc terminology for plant parts differed much from that of modern Oceanic languages. Our inability to reconstruct as many POc names for the parts of specific plants as there are in modern languages probably stems from two factors: (i) a rapid rate of lexical replacement in such names; (ii) shortcomings in the data for modern Oceanic languages. Both factors would reduce the number of cognate sets. It is possible that a faster rate of lexical replacement with specific plant part terms reflects a lower frequency of use. In small migrating communities, where it is likely that the younger people move on while the elders remain at home, there may be a tendency for less frequently used lexical items to be forgotten and later replaced if and when needed.


## Notes

[^1]: I would like to thank several people who provided me with unpublished data while I was working on this chapter: Catriona Hyslop and Armstrong Malau (Vures), Ralph Lawton (Kilivila), Anna Margetts (Saliba), Ian Scales (Nduke) and David Walsh (Raga). Thanks also to Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross for detailed comments on earlier versions of this chapter.

[^1]: Generic term.

[^2]: This refers to terms which denote the small and poorly developed bananas at the bottom of a bunch.

[^3]: Galo is the generic term for a number of different varieties of cooking banana.

[^4]: Gela yaiyai denotes the good upper bananas of a bunch.

[^5]: Gela yaibala denotes ten bunches of bananas.

[^6]: Gela lualako and Wayan tido are verbal forms meaning 'to flower (of a banana)'.

[^7]: Marshallese wir 111 wer 111 can also be used for bunches of coconuts.

[^8]: Marshallese p£(111Gŋ denotes the stalk inside a bunch of bananas or breadfruit.

[^2]: [Ivens](../references.md#source-Ivens1929) ([1929](../references.md#source-Ivens1929)) gives the following definitions of these Sa'a terms: hata 'a tree, hardwood, used to make gongs'; mamahu?e 'a tree, used for houseposts, quickset'; mawa 'a tree, red wood, strong smelling when chopped and causing vomiting, used for keels of canoes'; and iota '1. canoe, 2. a village, metaphorically from canoe', 3. a tree, used to make canoe planks'.

[^3]: In this and later tables Nduke, Wayan and Tikopia entries are from [Scales](../references.md#source-Scalesnd) ([n.d.](../references.md#source-Scalesnd)), [Pawley & Sayaba](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003)) and [Firth](../references.md#source-Firth1985) ([1985](../references.md#source-Firth1985)) respectively. The orthographies of the original entries have been replaced by the one used here (ch.1, [§4.2](#s-4-2)).

[^4]: With final-YJa this form apparently reflects POc final &ast;-!7 and added -a, perhaps an inalienably possessed form of the noun.

[^5]: Editor's note: Blust (ACD) also reconstructs &ast;puna(YJ) 'source, origin' (including perhaps the headwaters of a river), with Oceanic reflexes Tolai (MM) vuna 'beginning, cause, origin, source, basis, root, foundations, Samoan, Hawaiian (Pn) puna 'spring, source (of water) '. Gumawana (PT) una- 'the base of something; the source of something' and Bugotu vune- 'base, bottom, beginning, origin, trunk of tree' apparently also reflect this term, but their glosses imply conflation with reflexes of POc &ast;puqun .

[^6]: The origin of final -ŋa is unclear.

[^7]: It is unclear whether Motu rako 'twig' is inherited or is borrowed from another Papuan Tip language. The usual reflexes of POc &ast;-k- are Motu -y- or zero, not ··k-. [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1994a) ([1994](../references.md#source-Ross1994a)a) shows that Motu has borrowed lexicon from a southeast Papuan language; rako may be such a borrowing. However, he also lists inherited items in which &ast;k is reflected as Motu -k-. Note that Motu ra ko 'twig' cannot regularly reflect POc &ast;raga(q), as &ast;g is reflected as Motu g.

[^8]: Blust (ACD) suggests that the Micronesian data plus Bali vakara 'root' support the reconstruction of a POc (unbound?) form &ast;wakaR -a 'root'. As Bali vakara 'root' is a regular reflex of POc &ast;wakaR I have not recon- structed this form. There are a few other Proto Micronesian etyma that retain a POc final consonant and add &ast;-a; e.g. POc &ast;pata(YJ) is reflected as both &ast;fata and &ast;fataŋa 'tree trunk' in Proto Micronesian ([Bender et al. 2003](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003): 24).

[^9]: Editor's note: The morphology of POc inalienably possessed nouns with a stem-final consonant is obscure. Some reflexes suggest that a vowel was added before the suffix-initial consonant, e.g. &ast;wakaR-i-fia 'its root', others that the stem-final consonant was lost, e.g. &ast;waka-fia.

[^10]: Although Geraghty's reconstructions are all to the level of PEOc, he implies that &ast;Ramu- 'hair, fibre' could be attributed to POc by giving Proto Papuan Tip &ast;ramu 'root' as part of the supporting data.

[^11]: [French-Wright](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983): 79) also reconstructs POc &ast;kaka(R,d,l) 'to sprout' and &ast;pisi 'to bud, of leaves; to blossom', but neither of these reconstructions is well-supported.

[^12]: [Sperlich](../references.md#source-Sperlich1997) ([1997](../references.md#source-Sperlich1997): 85) writes that Niueanfua 'has a wide meaning range, mainly related to natural phenomena of growth, offspring, swelling and protective encasement used by various animals and plants'.

[^13]: [Blust](../references.md#source-Blust1976b) ([1976b](../references.md#source-Blust1976b)) reconstructs a term &ast;kuRo 'stem, trunk' on the basis of Gela kulo 'stem of a banana' and Samoan ?uo 'short thick log (about six feet long)', but the additional data presented above indicate that the Samoan form is not cognate, and that the POc term was more restricted in its meaning.

[^14]: Reflects &ast;kaligo rather than &ast;kalijo.

[^15]: The -ʔia ending ofKwaio butuʔia probably reflects tht: transitive suffix and 3sG object suffix. While there is no corresponding intransitive form tbutu, Kwaio does have other forms that look to be derived from an original base &ast;butu, such as butua 'squeeze together' and iota butubutu 'a traditional composite canoe' (iota 'canoe') ([Keesing 1975](../references.md#source-Keesing1975): 29).

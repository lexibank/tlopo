# Introducing Proto Oceanic plant names

## 1. Floristic regions


The western Pacific is divided by botanists into two floristic regions, northwest Melanesia and southeast Melanesia. NW Melanesia includes New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain, New Ireland and the Admiralties) and the Solomons archipelago including Buka and Bougainville but excluding the Reef and Santa Cruz Islands. SE Melanesia includes the Reef and Santa Cruz Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and the Loyalties, and Fiji. The boundary between NW and SE Melanesia thus corresponds with the boundary between Near and Remote Oceania (vol.2, ch.2, [§2](#s-2)).

Within NW Melanesia there is a gradual reduction in the number of genera and species as one moves east- and southeastward through the islands, but there are no major new genera. In SE Melanesia, on the other hand, we encounter genera that are not represented or hardly represented in the islands of NW Melanesia, for example the genus Agathis, to which the kauri species of SE Melanesia belong.

In this chapter, indeed in this volume, we are mainly concerned with NW Island Melanesia (i.e. NW Melanesia other than New Guinea), and particularly with the Bismarck Archipelago, as this is where the POc homeland was located (vol.2, ch.2).

## 2. Ways of classifying plants


There are a number of ways in which one might classify plants as a basis for dividing this book into chapters. Ideally the classification should be one which has some basis in POc terminologies, since the reconstruction of these terminologies is what we are about. Some obvious ways of classifying Oceanic plants are:

__ol__ a. by use; b. by ethnobotanical category; c. by vegetation habitat; d. by whether the plant is wild, tended or cultivated.

<a id="s-2-1"></a>
## 2.1. Classification by use


Although use forms the basis of an important work on the plants of the Solomon Islands ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988)), so many named plants have multiple uses that this criterion is not a suitable basis for classification. Plants may provide food (starch, greens, fruit or nuts), construction materials (housing timber, canoe components, cordage), firewood, caulk- ing, adornment, perfume, medicines, fish poison, parcelling, baskets and mats and more. The extent of multiple usages is highlighted by [Thaman](../references.md#source-Thaman1994) ([1994](../references.md#source-Thaman1994)), who analyses the uses of 140 plant species commonly found in the habitats of the Oceanic-speaking Pacific. 1 He finds that the 140 species have a mean of 7.3 uses each, the coconut palm having the maximum of 125 uses and just two species having no uses. The most frequently reported use was medici- nal, with 113 species out of 140 being used medicinally. Sixty species provided construction timber (including 54 out of 62 tree species). Thirty-four species were used in canoe- or boat- building (including 30 tree species). Fifty-one species were used as firewood (including 43 tree species). Thirty species provided dyes. Twenty-eight were used in making fishing equip- ment. And so on. The picture presented by [Powell](../references.md#source-Powell1976) ([1976](../references.md#source-Powell1976)) for New Guinea is similar.

There is a vast literature on the medicinal uses of plants in Oceanic societies, but no at- tempt is made to review it in the pages of this book. Many plants have many different medic- inal uses, often varying from place to place, and, conversely, similar maladies are treated with preparations from many different plants in different places. This means that there is no real likelihood of reconstructing the medicinal uses to which early Oceanic speakers put individual plants. In chapters 5-8 medicinal uses of plants are mentioned for those Island NW Melanesian and niVanuatu societies for which a substantial body of ethnobotanical in- formation is available (sources are listed inch 2, [§5.2](#s-5-2)), but this is intended as a sample, not a survey.


<a id="s-2-2"></a>
## 2.2. Classification by ethnobotanical categocy


The second possibility is ethnobotanical classification. In chapter 3 Evans reconstructs five major first-order categories of plant distinguished by POc speakers: &ast;kayu 'tree, shrub' , &ast;waroc 'vine', &ast;pali[s,j]i 'grass', &ast;taliŋa 'mushroom' and &ast;limut or &ast;lumut 'moss, algae' . A classification on this basis is certainly possible, but, as Evans points out, there are residual categories like palms (ch.3, [§4.3](#s-4-3)), 'clumps', bamboos, ferns and pandanus (ch.3, [§4.8](#s-4-8)) which may or may not have been counted as &ast;kayu by POc speakers. Thus there were quite possibly a number of fairly small first-order categories in addition to the five for which Evans is able to reconstruct labels above. Candidates are &ast;qauR, generic for bamboos (ch. 13, [§3.1](#s-3-1)), and &ast;padran, generic for pandanus species as well as denoting the coastal pandanus, Pandanus tectorius (ch.ll, [§2.5.1](#s-2-5)).

The largest problem with using ethnobotanical classification as a basis for categorising the reconstructions in this book, however, is practical: &ast;kayu is a huge category, in need of subdivisions for which Evans finds no linguistic warrant.

<a id="s-2-3"></a>
## 2.3. Classification by vegetation habitat and cultivation status


The third and fourth classificatory approaches form the basis of the chapter divisions from chapter 5 onward. Vegetation habitats, described in [§3](#s-3), [§4](#s-4) and [§5](#s-5) are the basis for chapters on wild plants, while plants that are generally tended or cultivated occur in separate chapters which have as a partial basis the ingredients of a typical Oceanic meal, described in [§6](#s-6).

This mixed classification reflects the primary POc land use division between &ast;qutan 'bushland, hinterland; inland', where wild plants grow, and &ast;quma 'garden, plantation', where plants are cultivated.

Wild plants are then divided primarily by vegetation habitat: coastal strand vegetation, mangrove swamp, primary lowland rain forest, and secondary lowland rain forest and grass- land. This has the virtue of placing plants in their environments and in relationship to one another within the environment. Oceanic languages have names for types of location (even though the reconstruction of POc names for them is somewhat problematic, partly because the best described Oceanic environments are rather different from one another: see vol.2, ch.3, [§1](#s-1)), and we can assume that this arrangement is at least not radically at odds with POc speakers' conceptualisations of their environment,

Food plants are divided first into the two major categories of the POc menu: &ast;kanaŋ 'starchy food, staples' and &ast;tamaji 'additional ingredients to accompany starchy food '. The latter is included in three chapters, on green vegetables, nut and fruit trees, and the coconut palm. The last is treated in a separate chaplter because of the complexity of its associated terminology. A further chapter treats plants that are cultivated, but not primarily for food.

The two chapters following this one, chapters 3 and 4, are by Bethwyn Evans, who treats the POc primary ethnobotanical classification and POc terms for parts of plants. The remain- ing chapters follow the outline just provided:

- 5. plants of the coastal strand
- 6. plants of the mangrove swamp
- 7. plants of primary lowland rain forest
- 8. plants of secondary lowland rain forest and grassland
- 9. staple food sources
- 10. green vegetables
- 11. nut and fruit trees
- 12. the coconut palm
- 13. other cultivated plants

The placing of plants in the first four of these chapters is at times a little arbitrary, as the same plant may occur in more than one habitat type. Crossreferences are provided to take account of this.

The agronomic boundary between bush and garden is fuzzy in Oceanic food production and was almost certainly just as fuzzy in POc agriculture ([§4](#s-4)). The distinction between trees that are tended or transplanted and those which aren' t is somewhat clearer, and the presence of a chapter on nut and fruit trees is a response to this fact, as most of these are trees that are at least tended in some Oceanic societies and likely to have been tended by POc speakers. This chapter is placed after the chapters on cultivated plants in recognition of the fact these trees form part of the overall agroforestry systems of NW Island Melanesian societies.

## 3. Vegetation habitats in NW Island Melanesia


Five natural vegetation habitats are recognised by botanists in NW Island Melanesia. The types and their descriptions are drawn mainly from [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998) ([1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 50--72).[^2] Four of these are:

```
1. coastal strand vegetation:
a) herbaceous zone
b) beach scrub
c) littoral forest
2. mangrove forest
3. freshwater swamp forest
4. primary lowland rain forest
```

The fifth is the montane rain forest of New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville, but this probably played little role, if any, in the lives of POc speakers and is not discussed further in this volume.

In addition there are three anthropogenic vegetation habitats:

__ol__ 1. garden vegetation 2. secondary lowland rain forest 3. grassland

These vegetation habitats are briefly described below, each with a listing of the species of which it is typically composed.


<a id="s-3-1"></a>
## 3.1. Natural vegetation habitats


2.3.1.1 Coastal strand vegetation

Coastal strand vegetation falls into three zones, a herbaceous zone, beach scrub, and littoral forest.

2.3.1.1.1 Herbaceous zone

On sandy beaches and beach ridges,[^3] vegetation begins at the high-water mark on the seaward slope with a herbaceous cover of creeping plants such as Ipomoea pes-caprae, Canavalia rosea (syn. C. maritima) (no reconstruction) and Wedelia biflora, as well as grasses and sedges, including Thuarea involuta.


<a id="p-29"></a>

2.3.1.1.2 Beachscrub

Next to or overlapping the herbaceous zone comes bush scrub with shrubs such as Pemphis acidula and Scaevola taccada and low-growing bushy-crowned trees like Hibiscus tiliaceus Thespesia populnea and Tournefortia argentea often densely tangled by climbers like Flag- ellaria indica. There is a ground layer of fems, grasses, gingers and herbs including Crinum asiaticum.

2.3.1.1.3 Littoral forest

On its landward side beach scrub borders, gradually or abruptly, on littoral or coastal strand forest. This is often dominated by evergreen broadleaftrees like Barringtonia asiatica, T ermi- nalia catappa, Heritiera littoralis and Calophyllum inophyllum (and in the Solomons archi- pelago Cerbera manghas) or the screwpine Pandanus tectorius, (on coral P. dubius) or some- times Casuarina equisetifolia. On beaches where the ridge formation has been eroded, the littoral forest borders immediately on the beach, and Barringtonia asiatica predominates. On coral islands where mixed littoral forest covers the whole island, the forest may in- clude Diospyros, Myristica and Rhus species. In the Solomons the lower storey includes Diospyros species, Ficus austrina, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Kleinhovia hospita, Morinda citrifolia and Premna corymbosa (Paijmans 1976:29-20, [Henderson & Hancock 1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988):321, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 50, 59, 70).

As [Barrau](../references.md#source-Barrau1955) ([1955](../references.md#source-Barrau1955): 17) notes, in many areas the littoral forest has been replaced by coconut palms.

2.3.1.2 Mangroveforest

Mangrove forests occur on stretches of coastline sheltered from wave action or along estu- aries or even on protected coral reefs, and especially in areas where there is regular rainfall which washes salt out of the soil. The mangrove forest may extend from seawater salinity on the seaward side to almost freshwater conditions on the landward side, where there is usually an abrupt transition to freshwater swamp forest. Mangrove forests are located in the intertidal zone, so the seaward margin undergoes much deeper twice-daily inundation than the landward margin. On the seaward margin species include A vicennia marina, Sonneratia caseolaris, S. alba and occasionally Ceriops tagal. Further landward Rhizophora and then Bruguiera species take over and the canopy assumes a forest stature. Towards its landward border the mangrove forest becomes more diverse, forming a canopy up to 25 m in height, and in the Bismarcks includes Lumnitzera littorea, Xylocarpus granatum, Excoecaria agal- locha, Camptostemon schultzii, Heritiera littoralis, Intsia bijuga and Inocarpusfagifer. Intsia bijuga and Inocarpus fagifer are also common lowland rain forest and swamp forest trees. The more landward mangrove forest is more open and has an undergrowth of shrubs and low-stature trees including Dolichandrone .spathacea and Myristica hollrungii. The Nypa fruticans palm also grows on the landward side of estuarine swamps (Paijmans 1976: 31-34, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998):50--5 1).

In the Solomons Lumnitzera littorea, Ceriops tagal and Dolichandrone spathacea occur towards the landward border of the mangrove forest. Inland of these are Sonneratia species and Xylocarpus granatum and as the ground becomes less saline Calophyllum inophyllum, Fagraea racemosa, Heritiera littoralis,Intsia bijuga and Pandanus species, with an under- storey of fems and the shrub Acanthus ebracteatus ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988): 319).


<a id="p-30"></a>

2.3.1.3 Freshwater swamp forest

Freshwater swamp forests occur on larger islands in areas where the water table, often brack- ish, is near the surface and during high-rainfall seasons sometimes above it. These locations are typically fiat areas near the coast with poorly drained soils. In NW Island Melanesia, all large tracts of freshwater swamp forest are found in Bougainville and the Solomons. They are few and small in the Bismarcks: there are patches on the north coast of New Britain, two deltas in the south of New Ireland, and a small amount (about 7%) on Manus Island and Los Negros (Paijmans 1976:37-48, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998):51-52,60,71, [Freyne & Bell 1982](../references.md#source-FreyneandBell1982)). Since the homeland of POc speakers was quite clearly in the Bismarcks, no chap- ter in the present volume is devoted to freshwater swamp forest. The trees characteristic of this habitat are in any case all found elsewhere, usually in lowland rain forests.

2.3.1.4 Primary lowland rain forest

The most widely distributed natural vegetation habitat in NW Island Melanesia is lowland tropical rain forest. Its most important species belong to the genera Calophyllum, Camp- nosperma, Canarium, Cryptocarya, Dracontomelon, Ficus, I ntsia, Octomeles, Pometia, Pte- rocymbium and Terminalia, along with Eucalyptus deglupta.

In Bougainville Pometia pinnata and Vitex cofassus form a forest with a tall canopy up to 35 m, and other genera include Alstonia, Celtis, Cryptocarpus, Dysoxylum Elaeocarpus and Sterculia. The understorey in Bougainville includes trees of the genera Diospyros, Garcinia, Gnetum, Myristica, Syzygium and palms of the genera Areca, Caryota and Licuala, as well as bamboos, tree ferns (Cyathea) and Pandanus (Paijmans 1976:64-65, [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 60--61).

Lowland tropical rain forests are more species-rich than other kinds of vegetation but nonetheless grow poorer as one moves southeastward. In the Solomons there are twelve species of big (canopy) trees: Calophyllum kajewskii, Calophyllum pseudovitiense, Camp- nosperma brevipetiolatum, Dillenia salomonensis, Elaeocarpus sphaericus, Endospermum medullosum, Gmelina moluccana, Maranthes corymbosa, Parinari salomonensis, Pometia pinnata, Schizomeria serrata and Terminalia calamansanai. Where forests have been bro- ken by cyclones or man, colonising species include Canarium species and Vitex cofassus. Lower tree and shrub layers consist of Barringtonia and Boerlagiodendron species, Leea in- dica and Areca catechu. The herb layer is patchy, but where gaps occur in the canopy, species of Calamus, bamboos and gingers predominate ([Henderson & Hancock 1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988): 320)

In the few locations in NW Island Melanesia where there is a marked dry season Garuga floribunda occurs alongside Terminalia and Ficus species (Paijmans 1976: 52).


<a id="s-3-2"></a>
## 3.2. Anthropogenic vegetation habitats


Much of the vegetation in NW Island Melanesia today is anthropogenic. It falls into three categories: garden vegetation, secondary lowland rain forest and grasslands.

2.3.2.1 Garden vegetation


<a id="p-31"></a>

Lapita villages were apparently typically located on or immediately behind the beach, as many modern villages in the Bismarcks still are. When a contemporary village is on the beach, however, the gardens often lie a distance away in the rainforest, sometimes in the submontane foothills. Villagers in rain forest areas of NW Island Melanesia typically follow a system which has been labelled 'bush fallowing rotaltion'. The forest is cleared, the garden is planted and harvested for about a year, then left fallow for 10--15 years. During the first two years of the fallow period, some crops continue to be harvested from the garden. Typically a family is entitled to use a number of garden plots which have been cleared by earlier generations and which are at different stages of fallowing rotation. Children are taught which plots the family may use, which places are good for taro, which for yams, and so on, across the whole fallow area used by the family as well as in current gardens ([Kwa'ioloa & Burt 2001](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001): 30). If a family has enough garden plots, then there is no need to create new plots by clearing primary forest. If not, then either plots will be used more frequently (not an ideal choice) or a new plot will be created by clearing forest. If the fallow period is long enough and rainfall is sufficient, then primary regrowth occurs and the garden plot more or less merges back into the primary forest. If the land is reused too early, then eventually secondary forest replaces primary regrowth. In drier areas it is replaced by grassland ([Barrau 1955](../references.md#source-Barrau1955): 17, 31, 1962: 45--47).

Garden vegetation today includes planted trees and sometimes wild trees that were present when the forest was cleared and are tended in situ (chapter 11 ), as well as the various sta- ples (chapter 9) and plants grown as green vegetables (chapter 10). Trees vary from place to place but include breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), mango (Mangifera indica), Malay apple (Syzygium malaccense), golden apples (Spondias cytherea), dragon plums (Dracontomelon dao and D. vitiense), canarium almonds (Canarium indicum and C. salomonense), Barring- tonia edulis, Citrus (mostly recent introducltions), guava (another recent introduction) and coconut palms (chapter 12).

2.3.2.2 Secondary lowland rain forest

[Henderson & Hancock](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988): 323) give an account of the regrowth sequence in the Solomons. Secondary rain forest trees tend to be more light-demanding species, which include Acalypha grandis, Alphitonia incana, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Macaranga species, Melochia umbellata, Pip- turus argenteus and Schleinitzia novo-guineensis, alongside planted species of M usa and He- liconia. As the fallow progresses, they lose their dominance to species typical of older re- growth such as Falcataria moluccana, Cananga odorata, Ficus species, Kleinhovia hospita, Rhus taitensis and Trichospermum psilocladum, along with the breadfruit and the mango and treefems like Cyathea brackenridgei and C. lunulata. Gingers occur in the shrub layer, along with the palms Areca catechu and Caryota rumphiana. Finally, some of the large tree species of primary forest return, especially Pometia pinnata and Vitex cofassus.

[Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998) ([1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 63) describe forest regrowth in Bougainville, but their stages are less clearly delineated than Henderson & Hancock' s. Regrowth vegetation includes wild varieties of cultivated plants, along with Heliconia indica, gingers, Caryota palms, grasses (Imperata cylindrica, Paspalum, Pennisetum macrostachyum), Kleinhovia hospita, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and species of Macaranga and Ficus (Mueller-Dombois & Fos- berg 1998: 63). Important secondary growth is dominated by species of Glochidion, Mac- aranga and Mallotus, along with species of Trema, Alphitonia, Casuarina, Trichospermum and Hibiscus, and the species Leucaena leucocephala, Kleinhovia hospita, Paraserianthes falcataria, M elanolepis multiglandulosa and Burckella obovata. There are also primary for- est trees that have not been removed: Canarium and Barringtonia species, breadfruit and Pangium edule. In older secondary forest Cananga, Endospermum, Canarium, Euodia, La- portea and Sterculia occur (Paijmans 1976: 59).


<a id="p-32"></a>

2.3.2.3 Grassland

Grasslands are quite rare in most of NW Island Melanesia, but occupy extensive areas of north Guadalcanal. They are dominated by kangaroo grass (Themeda australis), sword grass (Imperata cylindrica) and Pennisetum polystachion. They are usually maintained by regular burning. In less frequently burned areas Saccharum spontaneum and Miscanthusj/.oridulus also occur. Phragmites karka and Cyperus species appear in more poorly drained areas (Hen- derson & Hancock 1988:318-319, Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg 1988: 56-57).

## 4. The relationship between garden and bush in Proto Oceanic society


The division of vegetation habitats into natural and anthropogenic reminds us that human be- ings have brought substantial changes to their NW Melanesian island habitats. Recent schol- arly work on the agriculture of the region has emphasised that there is no clearcut agronomic boundary between garden and bush. As noted above, gardens sometimes include fruit- or nut-bearing trees that survive from the earlier primary forest, or forest tree species that have been planted in the garden. Sometimes fruit or nut trees are planted near the village as well. Some species are tended in their natural forest habitat.

[Kennedy & Clarke](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004)) argue that there is no sensible line to be drawn between crops grown in gardens and crops acquired from the bush, because they together constitute an in- tegrated system of resource management. They examine the literature on sago, canarium, pandanus, breadfruit and bananas, and show that all five have long been tended and trans- planted in ways that have fundamentally altere:d the landscape. They list other plants with similarly long-term relationships with human beings: Gnetum gnemon, Inocarpus fagifer , Pangium edule and Pometia pinnata. We can add to this list at least Barringtonia edulis, B. novae-hiberniae, B. procera, Burckella obovata, Dracontomelon species, Spondias cytherea, Syzygium malaccense, S. aqueum, Terminalia catappa and T. kaernbachii (A. [Walter 1994](../references.md#source-Walter1994)).

Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) and canarium almond (C. indicum and C. salomonense) trees are usually individually owned and tended where they have grown in the forest, either naturally or from planted suckers. Forest growth is cleared away from around the base of the breadfruit tree, and it may be fenced. Breadfruit seedlings are often also transplanted to village areas and older plants may be propagated by planting-depending on location-seeds, root cuttings or suckers.[^4] In the Solomons most canarium trees are planted near villages, but some grow wild. Terminalia catappa and T. kaernbachii are also often planted, whilst other Terminalia species with edible kernels (T. copelandii, T. impediens) are harvested from the forest. Several Syzygium species have edible fruit (S. malaccense, S. aqueum) and are either tended within the forest or planted. Barringtonia edulis is commonly planted as a village fruit tree in the Solomons (Paijmans 1976: 123-124, [Evans 1999](../references.md#source-Evans1999): 1).

The importance of tree crops to Pacific Islanders was first stressed by [Barrau](../references.md#source-Barrau1955) ([1955](../references.md#source-Barrau1955), 1963) and reinforced by Yen (197 4a ). They pointed out that fruits and nuts that were reported sim- ply to be gathered were in fact tended in varying degrees as part of the agricultural system. This has been reaffirmed by other scholars, e.g. [Thaman](../references.md#source-Thaman1989) ([1989](../references.md#source-Thaman1989)), [Flavelle](../references.md#source-Flavelle1991) ([1991](../references.md#source-Flavelle1991)), A. [Walter](../references.md#source-Walter1994) ([1994](../references.md#source-Walter1994)), [McEldowney](../references.md#source-Mceldowney1995) ([1995](../references.md#source-Mceldowney1995)), [Hviding & Bayliss-Smith](../references.md#source-HvidingandBaylissSmith2000) ([2000](../references.md#source-HvidingandBaylissSmith2000): 23), [Chowning](../references.md#source-Chowning2001) ([2001](../references.md#source-Chowning2001): 77-78), [Walter & Sam](../references.md#source-WalterandSam2002) ([2002](../references.md#source-WalterandSam2002): 76--77) and McClatchey e:t al. (2006a). For example, on Baluan Island (Admiralties) McEldowney found 23 tree crops, 17 of which were fruit- or nut-bearing. All occurred in three different types of location: near villages, in orchards, and scattered across gardened land. [Kennedy & Clarke](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004)) point out that the situation is sometimes even more complicated, as the status of a crop can range from wild through tended to cultivated, i.e. planted and cloned, and wild varieties are often used alongside domesticated plants, i.e. prop- agated vegetatively by cuttings or by planting suckers.


<a id="p-33"></a>

Before the introduction of steel implements tree crops are known to have had greater nu- tritional significance on the islands off the north coasts of New Guinea and New Britain and on the Mussau Islands than they have today, and it is likely that this is true at least of small islands throughout NW Island Melanesia. For example on Karkar Island, very important food sources included coconut, canarium almonds, breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), Tahitian chest- nut(/ nocarpus fagifer), Indian chestnut (Terminalia catappa ), dragon plum (Dracontomelon dao) and the fruit of Pouteria maclayana. Arable agriculture has increased in significance since the introduction of metal tools 80 or so years ago ([Bourke 1996](../references.md#source-Bourke1996), [Allen et al. 1994](../references.md#source-Allenetal1994)), but from my own observation it is clear that these nuts and fruits retain traditional significance.

Because agriculture is centred on what are conventionally called 'gardens' in English, the distinction between the English terms 'horticulture' and 'agriculture' is largely irrelevant in a Pacific context ([Brookfield 2001](../references.md#source-Brookfield2001):6, [Kennedy & Clarke 2004](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004)). However, recent liter- ature calls the use of either term into question because of the absence of a clear boundary between garden and forest in Pacific agriculture. Pinning down exactly whether a particular crop should be regarded as wild or cultivated in a particular location is extremely difficult. In consequence [Kennedy & Clarke](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004)) adopt the term 'agroforestry' from [Clarke & Thaman](../references.md#source-ClarkeandRandophRThaman1993) ([1993](../references.md#source-ClarkeandRandophRThaman1993) ).[^5] Whilst the reason for this decision is clear, however, there is still reason to retain 'horticulture' for activities in food gardens, as Meredith Osmond does in chapter 5 of volume 1, and to use 'arboriculture' for tree-tending activities in the forest.

The extent of agriculture in the Bismarck Archipelago before the arrival of POc speak- ers, i.e. Lapita people, is unknown, but there is reason to believe that the tending of bush trees and the planting of trees at convenient locations had been practised there long before the Lapita period. Before the arrival of Austronesian speakers, NW Island Melanesia was populated by groups who may or may not have cultivated a staple crop. However, as early as 20,000 years ago [Allen](../references.md#source-Allen1993) ([1993](../references.md#source-Allen1993)) and Gosd1en (1995) detect a gradual change in pattern in New Ireland, whereby people had started to move scarce resources to the locations where they lived instead of themselves moving from resource to resource. A species of Phalanger (possum) was imported into New Ireland, canarium trees were transplanted there from else- where, and obsidian (for making blades) was imported from the Willaumez Peninsula of New Britain. There was thus a move away from mobile hunting and gathering in the direction of what [Spriggs](../references.md#source-Spriggs1997a) ([1997a](../references.md#source-Spriggs1997a): 61) calls 'wild food production' and others label 'foraging sedentism' . Bringing resources to people (rather than people moving from resource to resource) allowed a community a degree of sedentariness not available to hunters and gatherers. In pre-Lapita NW Island Melanesia, foraging sedentism evidently included activities like tending trees and transplanting seedlings.

[LeBlanc](../references.md#source-LeBlanc2002) ([2002](../references.md#source-LeBlanc2002)) argues that for a population to adopt agriculture, it is necessary for it al- ready to be sedentary. IfNW Island Melanesian populations encountered by arriving Austro- nesian speakers in New Britain, New Ireland, Manus, Buka and Bougainville did not al- ready practise agriculture, they were almost certainly sedentary and would probably have shifted fairly rapidly to agriculture. The language map of New Britain, New Ireland and the Solomons offers circumstantial support for a hypothesis that these populations either did not have agriculture or were agriculturally inferior to the new arrivals. There are today tiny scattered groups each speaking its own Papuan language, surrounded by numerous Oceanic languages, a number of which show signs of Papuan influence in their phonology or gram- mar.[^6] The implication of this linguistic geography is that there were once far more Papuan languages in NW Island Melanesia, but as their populations adopted agricultural practices from their Austronesian-speaking neighbours they also adopted their languages.

This does not mean that these populations simply shifted mode of subsistence. Foraging sedentism also seems to be a necessary precursor of agriculture ([Cohen 2002](../references.md#source-Cohen2002)), and we have no reason to suppose that populations acquiring agriculture simply abandoned their previous practices. Rather it is a reasonable inference that they retained their hunting and tree-tending practices and combined these with newly acquired cultivation practices. It is thus possible that the hunting and tree-tending practices of early Lapita culture reflect at least in part an inheritance from pre-Lapita inhabitants of the Bismacks. What is certain is that about 1.3 kg of Canarium indicum and about 130 grams of Terminalia have been found in Lapita archae- ological contexts in the Arawe Islands (off the southwest coast of New Britain) ([Matthews & Gosden 1997](../references.md#source-MatthewsandGosden1997)). This is of course not direct evidence of Lapita tree-tending, but it is di- rect evidence that canarium nuts in particular were an important item of consumption among POc speakers. [Kirch](../references.md#source-Kirch1989) ([1989](../references.md#source-Kirch1989)) found circumstantial evidence for arboriculture in a Lapita as- semblage on Mussau Island which included shells of Aleurites moluccana, Burckella, Can- arium, coconut, Spondias cytherea, and Terminalia, peri carp of I nocarpus fagifer and seeds of Pometia pinnata.

We cannot take it for granted that agriculture: in the POc period was the same as it is today, but there is reasonable evidence that it was not very different. Presumably the area of forest that had been turned into gardens was less than it is today, and the areas of anthropogenic vegetation habitats were therefore also less extensive. But linguistic evidence ([§5](#s-5)) indicates that bush fallowing was already well established in NW Island Melanesia by the time POc broke up into daughter-languages.

## 5. Proto Oceanic terms for types of vegetation and land use


POc had terms denoting the contrast between land with natural primary vegetation and land cleared for gardening:

- • &ast;qutan 'bushland, hinterland; inland' (vol.1, ch.5, [§3.3](#s-3-3); vol.2, ch.3, [§5.1](#s-5-1) and ch.8,
- [§2.2.1](#s-2-2))
- • &ast;quma 'garden; to clear land for a garden' (vol.1, ch.5, [§3.1](#s-3-1))


<a id="p-35"></a>

In a few languages the reflex of &ast;qutan means 'garden' (Mussau utana, Banoni yitana, Tolo uta, Nese na-ut), a seemingly odd reversal of meaning-odd until one recognises that a sec- ondary sense of &ast;qutan was 'inland' (vol.2, ch.8, [§2.2.1](#s-2-2)), itself a natural outcome of the fact that the bush is always inland in relation to a coastal village. Since gardens were also inland from a coastal village, and sometimes quite a distance inland, the inference that &ast;qutan is a metonymous term for 'garden' entails only a small jump.

Contrasting with &ast;quma along the bush fallowing cycle was POc &ast;talu(n) 'old garden, fallow land, land returning to secondary growth' (vol.1, ch.5, [§3.1](#s-3-1); vol.2, ch.3, [§5.1](#s-5-1)).

The term &ast;qutan appears to have denoted uncultivated land in general, whether it was &ast;talu(n ), land returning to secondary growth after cultivation, or bushland that had never been brought under cultivation. The term for the latter appears to have been POc &ast;[waRu]waRu- 'appears' because there are phonological problems in the data. On one hand Misima, Proto Malaita-Makira and PPn all reflect the reconstructed form regularly, assuming that final &ast;-o of PPn &ast;wao reflects assimilation. On the other hand PMic medial &ast;-/- reflects POc &ast;-!-, not &ast;-R-. This irregularity is unexplained, but cannot be dismissed too lightly, as Proto Malaita- Makira &ast;[walu]walu could also reflect a form with POc&ast;-!-. I reconstruct POc &ast;[waRu]waRu because this explains a larger range of reflexes, but further data might lead to a revision.[^7]

In volumes 1 and 2 a number of other POc terms for landscape features were reconstructed which correspond very roughly to the vegetation habitats listed in [§3](#s-3). The correspondence is rough because the POc terms denote landscape features, not vegetation habitats in the botanical sense. Such terms are POc &ast;b(w)iker 'beach, esp. sandy beach' (vol.2, ch.3, [§3.1](#s-3-1))[^9] and the three terms reconstructed in vol.2, ch.3, [§5.2](#s-5-2), denoting swamps. As we note there, we have no principled way of determining which te:rm(s) denoted mangrove swamps and which freshwater swamps.

- POc &ast;[dr,r]ano 'lake, swamp'
- POc &ast;pʷaca     'swamp'
- POc &ast;[g,k]opu  'pond, lagoon, swamp'

A minor piece of evidence that POc speakers recognised a division between wild and cultivated varieties of plants is that wild plant names are sometimes fully reduplicated forms of a cultivated variety or a similar cultivated plant species ([§7.2](#s-7-2)).

## 6. The ingredients of an Oceanic meal


People in traditional Oceanic-speaking villages ate one cooked meal a day, usually after the day' s work. The meal typically consisted of starchy staples, made more appetising by the addition of coconut milk (ch.12, [§4.2](#s-4-2)), leafy vegetables (ch.10) and sometimes some meat or fish. Today the meal is most often boiled. Traditionally, boiling would have been common in communities which had clay pots. Will McClatchey (pers. comm.) points out that it was also possible in communities without clay pots: a stone was heated in the fire and dropped into a container of water. Such containers might be (watertight) leaf baskets, a wooden bowl, a ground out rock or a large shell. Since boiling with such utensils can still be observed in parts of NW Island Melanesia, there is good reason to think that it occurred traditionally. Food was presumably also roasted in the fire or baked over it or-on special occasions-steamed in an earth oven (for food preparation methods, see vol.1, ch.6).

The lexicons of Oceanic languages usually distinguish two main categories of ingredient:

- • starchy staples, including yams, taro, sweet potatoes and other root crops, cooking bananas and breadfruit;
- • the additional ingredients: coconut milk, leafy vegetables and protein foods (meat, fish, shellfish).

[Barrau](../references.md#source-Barrau1955) ([1955](../references.md#source-Barrau1955): 44) remarks on the existence of this division in New Caledonia, and translates the terms for the categories as 'food' and 'condiments'.

Dictionary definitions do not always mention all three components of the 'additional in- gredients' category, and it is difficult to know whether the definitions are sometimes deficient or whether the composition of the additional ingredients varies from one place to another. Among Takia speakers living inland on Karkar Island, for example, the additional ingredients often lack a protein food if no one has been hunting, as domestic animals (pigs and chickens) are slaughtered only for feasts.


<a id="p-37"></a>

The encoding of the two categories of ingredient in the lexicon varies from language to language, as is shown by the terms below from widely dispersed languages. Oceanic lan- guages have quite complex terminologies to do with eating, and the terms listed below are limited to generic terms for eating and food and to terms which presuppose the distinction between staples and additions as categories of meal ingredient. I have omitted, for example, terms for 'meat' where these have the wider meaning 'flesh'.

Aside from POc &ast;kani and &ast;paŋan,[^13] which are widely reflected, the sets of semantically similar forms above contain no cognate sets that justify POc reconstructions. Other cognate sets are decidedly localised but similar meanings recur:

```

5      (v)   'eat greens alone'                             Ramoaaina, Arosi
```

The meanings above are categorised into those referring to (1) starchy vegetables and hypemymously to food in general; (2) food consisting of starch and additional ingredients (coconut milk, leafy vegetables, fish or meat); (3) the additions; (4) fish and meat without starch; (5) leafy vegetables.


<a id="p-40"></a>

In the languages above, only two verbs mean something like 'eat starchy foods'. They are Arosi ŋau-koŋari 'eat one thing without relish' and Anejom topw-haŋ 'eat starch without additions'. Their literal meanings are instructive: Arosi 'eat empty', Anejom 'just eat'. They imply that the basic meaning of the verb 'eat' is 'eat starchy foods', and this appears to be true in other Oceanic languages too. All the verbs meaning 'eat' except Arosi ŋau (< POc &ast;ŋau 'gnaw') are reflexes of PMP &ast;kaen/POc &ast;kani 'eat', and all apparently refer primarily to eating starchy foods (although few dictionaries mention the fact). They have the generic meaning 'eat' by hypemymy. This inference is supported by the facts that (i) other verbs of eating never have this meaning; (ii) the form for 'starchy foods' in many Oceanic languages is or reflects a nominalisation of the reflex of this etymon; and (iii) reflexes in New Caledonian languages, e.g. Voh-Kone cani, Xaracuu kiJ, still mean 'eat carbohydrates, eat tubers'.

A verb with the meaning 'crave fish or meat' is often found in Oceanic languages, re- flecting the fact that in Oceanic speaking communities the main meal is often eaten without fish or meat.

Fewer languages appear to have terms referring to eating leafy vegetables alone. Ramoaa- ina odo and Arosi ŋau-kokona are the only instances found in a survey of Oceanic dictionary sources. In [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d)) I distinguished two categories of meal ingredient, starchy staples and leafy greens. With more dictionary data, it has become clear that the primary categori- sation of meal ingredients is into starch and additional ingredients, and that leafy vegetables are a subcategory of 'additional ingredients'.

The ubiquitousness of verbs and nouns which presuppose the 'starchy food' ([§6.1](#s-6-1)) and 'additional ingredients' ([§6.2](#s-6-2)) categories suggests strongly that these categories were already present in POc.


<a id="s-6-1"></a>
## 6.1. Starchy food


Staple food sources are easily grown starchy foods ofvegetable origin that are high in food energy. Dictionary definitions of terms for 'staple food' or 'starchy food' in Oceanic lan- guages are rarely exhaustive, sometimes referring to yams, sometimes to taro, sometimes to root crops in general. This is, of course, often due to variations in the staples consumed from one area to another: taro is grown in wetter regions, yams in drier areas, and breadfruit on atolls. For New Guinea Bourke (in preparation) lists Colocasia taro, yams (Dioscorea escu- lenta and D. alata ), banana and sago as the most important staple foods before the arrival of the sweet potato. An early botanical account suggests that taro, some yam species, ba- nanas and breadfruit probably formed the traditional staple foods of Pacific islanders ([Guppy 1906](../references.md#source-Guppy1906): 412-415). [Pawley & Sayaba](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003)) define Wayan maŋiti as including the staples ba- nanas and breadfruit as well as root crops, and knowledge of Oceanic eating habits justifies assuming definitions of this kind of breadth for the corresponding terms in many Oceanic languages. The sago palm is included with oth1;:r staples in chapter 9 because it serves as a staple in some Oceanic societies and as a famine food in others.

Two POc forms are reconstructed with the probable meaning 'starchy food' and hyper- nymously 'food in general': &ast;kanaŋ and &ast;kuta.

POc &ast;kanaŋ and its variant &ast;kanan, both 'staple food, food in general', reflect PMP &ast;kan- an 'dish, plate, meal'. This was a nominalisation of PMP &ast;kaen 'eat', or &ast;kan in the context of certain affixes. PMP had several nominalising affixes, among them &ast;-en and &ast;-an. PMP &ast;-en was reflected in POc only in a few fossilised contexts like &ast;kanoŋ 'flesh, meat, coconut flesh' (ch.12, [§4.2](#s-4-2)), from PMP &ast;kan-en 'something to be eaten, food'. PMP &ast;-an 'locative nominaliser', on the other hand, became POc &ast;-anl&ast;-aŋ, a productive nominalising affix with wider functions than in PMP. Because of this productivity, as the nominalising forms and strategies of Oceanic daughter-languages changed in various ways (vol.1, ch.2, [§3.2.1](#s-3-2)), so lexical items formed by nominalisation sometimes retained their old forms and sometimes changed in accordance with the changes in nominalising morphology. Forms which reflect such changes are listed below under 'cf. also '.[^14]

A further twist is reflected in the forms under 'cf. also' above. The base of PMP &ast;kan-an was &ast;kan. The base of the forms under 'cf. also' is POc &ast;kani. This reflects PMP &ast;kan-i, where &ast;-i is a reflex of the PAn suffix &ast;-i 'location focus, atemporal', reinterpreted as a transitiviser in POc ([Pawley & Reid 1980](../references.md#source-PawleyReid1980); vol.1, ch.2, §[§3.1.2](#s-3-1)-3) but lexicalised as part of the POc base when the erstwhile base, e.g. &ast;kan, was a monosyllable. As a result, the forms under 'cf. also' have the base &ast;kani, which never co-occurred with a nominalising affix in PAn and PMP.

Several reflexes of POc &ast;kuta denote a major staple in the language concerned, either banana or yam, suggesting that the POc term denoted 'staple food'. However, it is also pos- sible that &ast;kuta was originally a specialised verb of eating, as the Gumawana, Iduna, Gela and Tolo glosses imply.

## 6.2. Additional ingredients


The term POc &ast;tamaji 'additional ingredients to accompany starchy food' is presented here only because it supports the claim that POc speakers divided meal ingredients into 'starchy food' and 'additional ingredients' ([§6](#s-6)).

Reflexes of &ast;tamaji with meanings supporting the reconstructed meaning are found in Mapos Buang (NNG), Gela, Longgu and Bauro 16 (all SES) and perhaps Teop (MM). A larger number of reflexes support another meaning, 'provisions for a journey': they are found in Bariai, Takia (both NNG), Dawawa (PT) and Sursurunga (MM). However, these are all Western Oceanic reflexes, implying that this meaning may have developed in the west after Oceanic speakers had begun to spread out across Oceania.

The concept of 'additional ingredients' was also lexicalised in PMic &ast;ta(l,n)ia 'side dish of meat, fish, or sauce' ([Bender et al. 2003](../references.md#source-Benderetal2003): 89).

## 7. Apparent encodings of plant categorisations in Oceanic plant names


A number of Oceanic languages appear to use prefixes or reduplication in plant names as a means of categorising the plant thus named. However, this categorisation is more apparent than real. The prefixes described in [§7.1.1](#s-7-1) and [§7.1.4](#s-7-1) and the reduplication described in [§7.2](#s-7-2) reflect strategies for creating new plant names rather than direct reference to categories of plant. The prefixes described in [§7.1.3](#s-7-1) are part of the debris left by an earlier numeral classifier system.


<a id="p-44"></a>


<a id="s-7-1"></a>
## 7.1. Prefixes


Three kinds of prefix stand out in the history of some Oceanic plant names reconstructed in this book:

- • prefixes reflecting POc &ast;kayu 'tree, shrub' (§[§7.1.1](#s-7-1)-7.1.2);
- • prefixes reflecting POc &ast;puqu(n) 'base of1ree; source, origin' and &ast;raun 'leaf ([§7.1.3](#s-7-1));
- • the POc prefix &ast;mala- 'resembling' ([§7.1.4](#s-7-1));

The first two categories appear at first sight to be rather similar, but the evidence suggests that they are derived from different POc constmctions and have different uses.

2.7.1.1 Reflexes of POc '·'kayu 'tree, shrub'

In several Western Oceanic languages some plant names begin with a prefix that means 'tree or shrub'. Examples from three languages are given below, together with the protoforms which they reflect. The three prefixes are Yabem ka-, Muyuw a- and Patpatar i-, each of which is assumed to reflect POc &ast;kayu 'tree'.Yabem ka- occurs on most tree names, Muyuw a- on many, and Patpatar i- on just a few. 17

```

A simple preliminary hypothesis is that these prefixes label their denotata as members of the POc &ast;kayu taxon, 'trees and shrubs' (ch.3, [§4.2](#s-4-2)). But ifthis were so, we would expect to find the prefix on every tree name in these languages and we would also expect to find prefixes reflecting the other primary plant taxa, &ast;waroc 'vine', &ast;pali[s,j ]i 'grass', &ast;taliŋa 'mushroom' and &ast;l[i,u]mut 'moss, algae. Neither expectation is fulfilled.


<a id="p-45"></a>

Data from other Oceanic languages sugge:st an alternative hypothesis, namely that a reflex of &ast;kayu occurs in cases where the following root is in some way descriptive of the tree, i.e. cases parallel to English 'flame tree ', 'rain tree ', 'coral tree ', 'bead tree' and 'canoe tree ', all coinages naming trees of the Pacific. Among the data above Patpatar i-kon 'Heritiera littoralis' is a strikingly obvious example of this. The cognate set below is presented in ch.6, [§4.4](#s-4-4), and it is argued there that it reflects POc &ast;kayu qone, which can be glossed 'beach tree' (&ast;qone 'beach' ).

The two Oceanic languages for which the best information about plant names is avail- able are theSE Solomonic language Kwara'ae and Wayan Fijian.[^18] Only a small number of Wayan tree names begin with a reflex of POc &ast;kayu. [Pawley & Sayaba](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003)) list the seven entries below.

```
kaidam           'wild nutmeg, Myristica chartacea'        dam           'tum reddish'
kaidrisi         'wild nutmeg, Myristica chartacea'        drisi         'be reddish'
kailalalau       'thorny shrubs, Caesalpinia spp.'         !au           'be pricked, wounded'
kailo            'small trees, Diospyros spp. "            to            'be dark, secretive'
kaimooemooe      'mimosoid tree taxon'                    mooemooe      'have a short sleep'
kaimoku          'creeper, Mimosa pudica'
kaivula          'tree, probably Endospermum               vula          'moon'
macrophyllum'
```

Significantly, for six out of seven the dictionary independently lists a meaning for the root. For four the descriptive meaning is clear. Myristica chartacea has red sap: dam and drisi mean respectively 'tum reddish' and 'be reddish'. The term kaimooemooe denotes Albizia saman and Serianthes vitiensis, the leaflets of which fold together at night: mooemooe means 'have a sleep'. Endospermum macrophyllumEuphorbiaceae is a timber tree with pale yellow wood, which perhaps accounts for the name kai-vula, literally 'moon tree' . [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001)) list thirty-six names of trees, big and not so big, beginning with ʔai-. Most of these are explicitly descriptive, according to Kwa'ioloa and Burt. The first eleven are listed below, and nine out of eleven are descriptive.

```
ʔaibu        'tree, Diospyros ebenum'
ʔaisarufi    'tree, Eugenia if.fusa'                       sarufi    'big tree, Litsea alba'
ʔaisaliŋa    'big tree, Aporosa papuana'                   aliŋa    'ear'
ʔaisubu      'big tree, Pimeleodendron amboinicum'
ʔaiuluulu    'big tree, Vitex cofassus'                    uluulu    'bushy'
ʔaikame      'big tree, Putranjiva roxburgii               kame      'monitor lizard'
ʔaikusi      'big tree, Cryptocarya alleniana"             kusi      'greybird'
ʔaikaʔo      'big tree, Xylopia papuana'                   kaʔo      'bamboo'
ʔailali      'Tahitian chestnut, Inocarpusfagifer'         !ali      'kidney'
ʔairade      'trees, Dysoxylum' spp.                       rade      'stink'
ʔaininiu     'big tree, Horifieldia irya'                  niniu     'palm, Gulubia macrospadix'
```


<a id="p-46"></a>

In two cases, ʔaisarufi and ʔaininiu, the tree is named for a resemblance to another plant. The tree ʔaisaliŋa, literally 'ear tree ', is so named because the leaf has 'ears' at its base. Two reasons are given for the name 'monitor lizard tree', ʔaikame: its bark is said to be like the skin of a monitor lizard, and the monitor lizard is said to take refuge in this tree when it is chased by a dog. The 'greybird tree ', ʔaikusi, is so named because its leaf bloom is like the feathers of a kusi bird.

The most striking feature ofKwara'ae ʔai- is its distribution: it is never prefixed to a reflex of a POc tree name. This implies that it is used productively for descriptive coinages and that it does not cooccur with roots that are felt to be tree names in their own right.

The inference to be drawn from these observations is that POc had a construction [&ast;kayu DESCRIPTOR] which was used for coining tree names. Kwara'ae and Fijian evidence suggests that [&ast;waRoc DESCRIPTOR] also occurred (&ast;waRoc 'vine, creeper' > Wayan wa, Kwara' ae kwalo), e.g. Wayan wa bitubitu 'creeper taxon of strong-stemmed vines', literally 'bamboo creeper'; Kwara'ae kwazo kakali 'wild passionfruit, Passiflorafoetida', literally 'Hornstedtia vine', because its seeds resemble those of the plant Hornstedtia lycostoma. Like Kwara' ae ʔai-, Kwara'ae kwazo is used productively for new coinages like the name of the introduced passionfruit.

2.7.1.2 POc '·'ka- in trisyllabic tree names

Among POc plant names trisyllables are rarer than disyllables, reflecting a pattern in POc stems generally. The first syllable of a number of trisyllables is reconstructed as &ast;ka-, with perhaps greater than chance frequency, and it seems probable that at least some of these also reflect the construction with &ast;kayu posited above. Examples are:

```
POc         &ast;kanawa(n)          'Cordia subcordata'      ch.5, [§4.1.1](#s-4-1)
POc         &ast;katita             'the putty nut'          ch.7, [§5.10](#s-5-10)
POc         &ast;kasiala            'a palm, Caryota sp.'   ch.7, [§5.11.1](#s-5-11)
POc         &ast;kalaka             'Planchonella sp.'      ch.7, [§4.10](#s-4-10)
POc         &ast;kapika             'Malay apple'           ch.11, [§3.7](#s-3-7)
PWOc        &ast;kasuwai            'mango'                  ch.11, [§3.4](#s-3-4)
PWOc        &ast;kapu(r,R)ik        'k.o. wild melon'        ch. l3, [§7.4](#s-7-4)
POc         &ast;[ka]1JaRi          'canarium almond'       ch.11, [§2.1](#s-2-1)
POc         &ast;[ka]timun          'cucurbit (generic)'     ch. l3, [§7.4](#s-7-4)
```

The inference that &ast;ka- was indeed a prefix is strengthened by the fact that in the last two cases there are reflexes of forms with and without &ast;ka-, i.e. &ast;kaŋaRi vs &ast;ŋaRi, &ast;katimun vs &ast;timun, implying either that &ast;ka- was an omissible prefix, or that &ast;ka- was part of the stem but was reanalysed as an exemplar of the prefix and hence deleted.


<a id="p-47"></a>

The Bola (MM) reflex of POc &ast;[ka]ŋaRi is taŋari, implying either replacement of one (perceived) prefix by another or some form of wordplay. The Kairiru (NNG) reflex of &ast;kalaka is lalak, apparently a reduplication of suffixless &ast;!aka. POc &ast;[ja ]latoŋ 'nettle tree' has reflexes with and without POc &ast;ja-, and &ast;ja- is replaced in PNCV by &ast;ga- (ch.7, [§6.3.2](#s-6-3)). Again this implies prefix replacement or wordplay.

2.7.1.3 Reflexes of POc '·jJuqu(n) 'tree, shrub' and '"raun 'leaf'

In certain NCV languages tree names occur with one of two prefixes. In Tamambo, stems naming trees and large bushes (but not other plant types) are regularly prefixed with vu- 'tree ', e.g. vu-mambue 'chestnut tree ', vu-niu 'coconut palm', vu-ŋai-ŋai 'canarium nut tree' ([Jauncey 1997](../references.md#source-Jauncey1997)). Vines, ferns, tubers and grasses are not prefixed with vu-, but Jauncey ob- serves that 'some large kinds of bushes are marked as trees, but only if they do have a main central trunk'. This supports her inference that vu- reflects POc &ast;puqu(n) 'base of tree; source, origin' (ch. 4, [§2.1](#s-2-1)).

Contrasting with vu- is the prefix ra- 'le:af of (ROOT)', reflecting POc &ast;raun 'leaf (ch. 4, [§2.5](#s-2-5)), e.g. ra-yaviya 'leaf of Malay apple', ra-yatabola 'leaf of Dracontomelon vitiense', ra-moli 'leaf of citrus tree '.

Both prefixes derive countable units. Thus [vu- ROOT] means 'a tree of the kind denoted by ROOT' and [ra-ROOT] means 'a leaf of the kind of tree denoted by ROOT '. This interpretation receives support from the fact that the prefixes also occur with xai 'tree, wood': vu-xai is 'a tree', i.e. vu- denotes the unit and xai the nature of the unit. POc &ast;puqu(n) meant 'base of tree', but by metonymy acquired the sense 'a tree-like unit'.  Francois (2002: 50) reports that the Araki prefixes vi- and da- have similar functions to Tamambo vu- and ra- respectively.

The corresponding forms in Fijian languages preserve largely unchanged the POc con- struction from which Tamambo vu- and ra- are derived. In Wayan Fijian we find the con- struction [NOUN ni NOUN]. In the broadest t1;:rms, the second noun serves as an attribute of the first. Thus in a phrase like rau ni kulu 'a breadfruit leaf, kulu 'breadfruit' specifies the type of rau 'leaf. For example:

- • vu 'base, bottom' in vu ni niu 'a coconut palm', vu ni kulu 'a breadfruit tree ', vu ni koka 'a Bischofia javanica tree ';
- • rau 'leaf in rau ni niu 'a coconut frond ', rau ni kulu 'a breadfruit leaf, rau ni koka 'a Bischofia javanica leaf ;
- • vua 'fruit' in vua ni kulu 'fruit of breadfruit tree' (i.e. 'a breadfruit' ).

Like Tamambo vu-, Wayan vu 'base, bottom' is used metonymically to refer to whole trees. As a result, like Tamambo xai, Wayan kai '1tree, shrub' can serve as the second noun: vu ni kai 'a tree/shrub ', rau ni kai 'a leaf, vua ni kai 'fruit of tree' (i.e. 'a fruit' ), tiki ni kai 'piece of wood, stick' (tiki 'part, piece' ).

Wayan, like other Fijian languages, here preserves a POc noun phrase construction which had a variety offunctions. Sometimes called the 'associative' construction in the literature of Oceanic linguistics, this construction allowed one noun to be used as an attribute modifying another. It had two forms, the choice between them depending on whether the first (head) noun was a zero-valency noun or a monovalent noun.[^19]

In the first variant of the construction, the h1ead noun is a zero-valency noun:

```
&ast;a     polo   ni    niuR
ART   juice of coconut
'coconut water' (Lynch et al. 2002: 77)
```

The second noun is a generic (non-specific) possessor, and thus an attribute, of the first (head) noun.

In the second variant the head noun was monovalent and in consequence ni was replaced by &ast;qi:

```
&ast;a     qaqe   qi   boRok
ART    leg     of pig
'a pig's leg' (Lynch et al. 2002: 76)
```

In Fijian languages reflexes of &ast;ni and &ast;qi have been redistributed but the construction otherwise survives unchanged. This construction has a complex history in Oceanic languages ([Hooper 1985](../references.md#source-Hooper1985), [Ross 1998b](../references.md#source-Ross1998b), 2001b).

We can infer, for example, that a particular fruit tree of the species Syzygium malaccense, the Malay apple, would have been referred to as &ast;(a) puqu(n) ni kapika (&ast;a ARTICLE; kapika Syzygium malaccense, ch.11, [§ 3.7](#s-3-7)), that a leaf and a fruit of the species would have been referred to respectively as &ast;(a) raun ni kapika and &ast;(a) puaq ni kapika or, if the head nouns were directly possessed in POc, as &ast;(a) raun qi kapika and &ast;(a) puaq qi kapika. We can also infer that Tamambo vu- and ra- and their cognates in other NCV languages reflect a grammaticisation of this construction with considerable phonological attrition.

This POc construction is also reflected in Kwara'ae plant naming, but in a rather different way from NCV. [Henderson & Hancock](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988):: 277) report that the name of a small tree is optionally preceded by faʔi and the name of a plant that grows straight without branching (and some that do branch) by fiʔi, e.g.faʔi keto or keto 'Macaranga spp. ',fiʔi arakai or arakai 'yam sp., Dioscorea pentaphylla'. [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001)) translate.fiʔi as 'clump', which is probably more accurate than Henderson and Hancock's characterisation.


<a id="p-49"></a>

The morphemesfaʔi andfiʔi belong to a set of classifiers described in Deck' s grammar and used principally for counting (1934: 7-1 0). These are listed in Table 2.1 along with cor- responding forms in closely related Kwaio and Lau, the Proto Polynesian classifiers recon- structed in POLLEX, and the POc nouns from which they are derived.

Several of the Kwara'ae classifiers share the form monosyllable + -ʔi or -?e. Their com- mon form reflects their shared origin in the POc construction [MONOVALENT NOUN &ast;qi NOUN] described above.20 The likely POc usage from which the classifiers in Table 2.1 are derived is illustrated below:[^21]

```
&ast;i-tolu     puaq qi pudi
3sG-three fruit of banana
'three bananas' (= '(there are) three fruit of banana') (Lynch et al. 2002: 74)
&ast;i-tolu     puqun ni pudi
3sG-three trunk       of banana
'three banana trees' (= '(there are) three trees of banana')
```

Some classifiers did not combine with &ast;qi, either because they remained disyllabic or be- cause they were derived from zero-valency nouns which instead headed the POc construction [ZERO-VALENCY NOUN &ast;ni NOUN] .

The classifier faʔi is described by Deck as being used to count round, compacted or heaped units, but it seems to me that, like reflexes of PMP &ast;buaq/POc &ast;puaq 'fruit' (ch.4, [§2.8](#s-2-8)) in a number of Austronesian languages, it is the default classifier for countable inanimate objects, i.e. it is used when no other classifier is more appropriate.[^22]

2.7.1.4 POc '·'mala- 'resembling'

Plant names which begin with the POc prefix &ast;mala- 'resembling' occur quite frequently in Oceanic languages.[^23] This has evidently been an important means of forming new plant names, most often by exploiting the resemblance of one tree to another.[^24] As in the redu- plicative process described below ([§7.2](#s-7-2)), the tree denoted by a name with &ast;mala- is generally inferior in some way to the one denoted by the plain root.

Examples from Nakanai (MM) are: mala-savula 'a plant, Ficus sp.' (< savula 'the fruit of a tree, candlenut, Aleurites moluccana' ); mala-sesege 'a plant, Acrostichum aureum' (< e-sesege 'small black crablike shellfish (PLURAL)'); mala-viva-viva 'a wild shrub, Cleron- dendron paniculatum, considered to be related toe-viva 'cultivated shrub with edible leaves,


<a id="p-50"></a>

Abelmoschus manihot'. Similar examples are found in other Meso-Melanesian languages: Kara and Patpatar of New Ireland and Nehan of Nissan Island ([Ross 2005](../references.md#source-Ross2005)b).

In Kwara'ae (SES), [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001)) note the following instances:

```
mala-ŋali     'Canarium asperum'
mala-ʔadoʔa   'Canarium harveyi'
mala-ʔafiʔo   'Syzygium aqueum
mala-rufa     'Metrosideros parviflora'
mala-ʔasai    'wild mango tree, Mangifera mucronulata'
mala-kona     'Burckella sorei'
mala-dili     'a shrub, Dracaena angustifolia'
I) ali        'canarium nut, C. indicum'
ʔadoʔa        'C. salomonense'
ʔafiʔo        'Malay apple, S. malaccense'
rufa         'Syzygium lauterbachii'
ʔasai         'mango tree, M. indica'
kona         'B. obovata'
dili         'a shrub, Cordyline fruticosa'
```

In Raga (NCV), [Walsh](../references.md#source-Walsh2004) ([2004](../references.md#source-Walsh2004)) notes mal-buliva 'unidentified Ficus sp.' (< buliva 'Ficus aspera'), mal-yaviya 'unidentified tree sp.' (< yaviya 'Malay apple, Syzygium malaccen- sis'), mal-walahi 'unidentified tree sp.' (< walahi 'Semicarpus vitiensis') and mal-bei-bei 'unidentified Polyscias sp.' (< bei 'Polyscias sp. ').

Examples are also found in Fijian and Polynesian languages. Like reduplication as a pro- cess in forming plant names, POc &ast;mala- as a plant-name formative receives support from evidence outside Oceanic which suggests that it is descended from a PMP form ([Ross 2005](../references.md#source-Ross2005)b).


<a id="s-7-2"></a>
## 7.2. Reduplication


A reduplicated form (usually with CVCV-) in Oceanic often encodes the perception that the denotatum is inferior to or a diminutive of the denotatum of the unreduplicated form. In the case of plant names, reduplication often means that the denotatum is a wild variety of the cultivated plant denoted by the unreduplicated form. It seems likely that this reduplica- tive derivational process occurred not only in POc, but at least as early as Proto Malaya- Polynesian.

Thus in Dobu (PT) [Arnold](../references.md#source-Arnold1931) ([1931](../references.md#source-Arnold1931)) cites rabia 'sago palm' vs rabi-rabia 'useless sago palm', magi 'areca palm' vs magi-magi 'useless palm resembling areca palm', boro 'taro' vs boro-boro 'wild taro', udi 'banana' vs udi-udi 'wild banana'.

From closely related Kilivila (Trobriand Islands) Ralph Lawton (pers. comm.) provides natu 'a tree with edible fruit like mango' (probably Burckella obovata- MR) vs gi-natu-natu 'a tree with inedible fruit', meku 'a hardwood tree used for carving' vs kai-meku-meku 'a tree no good for carving' (kai 'tree'), seda 'a nut tree' vs seda-seda 'a tree without nuts'.

The POc term ancestral to Dobu udi 'banana' was &ast;pudi (ch.9, [§3](#s-3)). Its reduplicated form &ast;pudi-pudi is a candidate for reconstruction with the meaning 'wild banana', at least in PWOc.

</table>




<a id="p-51"></a>

Other reduplicated forms in Ramoaaina are lama 'coconut tree or fruit' vs lama-lama 'wild coconut tree or fruit' and bara 'breadfruit' vs bara-bare 'wild breadfruit'. For nearby Patpatar [Peekel](../references.md#source-Peekel1984) ([1984](../references.md#source-Peekel1984)) lists tuh 'sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum' vs tuh-tuh 'wild sugar- cane, Saccharum spontaneum', pulaka 'Polynesian arrowroot, T acca pinnatifida' vs pulaka- pulaka 'wild varieties of Polynesian arrowroot', sier 'betelpepper vine, Piper betle' vs sier- sier 'a vine, Piper fragile, P. singkojang or P. banksii' .

Wayan Fijian has niu 'coconut palm' vs niu-niu 'cycad, Cycas circinalis' and vara 'ger- minating coconut' vs vara-vara 'taxon offieshy herbs, particularly orchids' .

[Biggs](../references.md#source-Biggs1991) ([1991](../references.md#source-Biggs1991): 67-69) notes that reduplication was one of the devices used by the newly arrived Eastern Polynesian ancestors of the Maori to name New Zealand plants which resem- bled those they had known in their eastern Polynesian homeland. His examples include Proto Polynesian &ast;futi 'banana' vs Maori huti-huti 'sweet potato variety', Proto Polynesian &ast;kawa 'Piper methysticum' vs Maori kawa-kawa 'Macropiper excelsum' and Proto Polynesian &ast;koli 'tree or shrub with perfumed fruit' vs Maori kori-kori 'a buttercup, Ranunculus insignis'.

In Marovo (MM) several forms are found with a somewhat different semantic derivation. Here the reduplicated base denotes a feature which somehow characterises the plant denoted by the reduplicated form. Hence vose-vose 'a tree of the deep forest, used for making paddles etc' (< vose 'paddle '), muta-muta 'a forest tree with sap the smell of which causes vomiting' (< muta 'vomit' ), and ta-talo 'a sea plant with calcified leaves, Halimeda sp.' (apparently < talo 'taro ').


## Notes

[^1]: A number of the species listed by Thaman do not appear to occur in NW Island Melanesia, but species selected from this floristic region would produce similar results.

[^2]: Descriptions of regional vegetation habitats are common in the botanical literature on the Pacific islands. One of the earliest (and surprisingly comprehensive) is [Warburg](../references.md#source-Warburg1899) ([1899](../references.md#source-Warburg1899)). Others include [Barrau](../references.md#source-Barrau1955) ([1955](../references.md#source-Barrau1955)), Paijmans (1976) and [Mueller-Dombois & Fosberg](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998) ([1998](../references.md#source-MuellerDomboisandFosberg1998): 59). I have mostly followed the last, as it treats NW Island Melanesia as a separate floristic region and subdivides it into the Bismarcks, Bougainville and the Solomons. Paijmans (1976) sometimes provides significant additional detail, but he writes about 'New Guinea' without distinguishing between the mainland as a whole and the Bismarcks and Bougainville.

[^3]: Where the coast is being built up outwards by sand, a succession of ridges develops, parallel to the beach. Ridges are typically about 2m high closer to the beach. On their inland side they merge into gently undulating fiats (Paijmans 1976: 27- 28).

[^4]: [Kennedy & Clarke](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004) ([2004](../references.md#source-KennedyandClarke2004)) give a summary of locations and cite sources.

[^5]: The term is older, but is used, e.g., by ([Flavelle 1991](../references.md#source-Flavelle1991)) principally to designate the cultivation of a village orchard rather than the whole system of plant cultivation including garden, orchard and tending forest trees.

[^6]: Madak (New Ireland) shares phonological features with its Papuan neighbour Kuot that are largely not shared by neighbouring Oceanic languages ([Ross 1994](../references.md#source-Ross1994a)c). Several languages of western and southwest New Britain (Bebeli, Sengseng, Kaulong) mark human gender in certain ways that are otherwise unknown in Oceanic lan- guages.

[^7]: Gela ao may not be cognate, as the expected Gela form is t walu .

[^8]: This set is repeated in part from vol.1, ch.5, [§3.3](#s-3-3) and vol.2, ch.3, [§5.1](#s-5-1), where PEOc &ast;wao 'forest' was recon- structed, following [French-Wright](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983) ([1983](../references.md#source-FrenchWright1983)).

[^9]: POc &ast;qone 'sand, sandy beach' (vol.2, ch.3, [§7.5](#s-7-5)) appears primarily to denote the sand rather than the location as part of an island.

[^10]: -kuda chew, taʔula 'banana leaf under food ', the latter presumably a reference to the fact that vegetables and meat are eaten together at features where food is laid out on banana leaves.

[^12]: Presumably with starchy food.

[^13]: This is to my knowledge the only reconstructable POc verb pair to preserve an intransitive form reflecting PMP &ast;paN- (vol.1, ch.2, [§3.1.3](#s-3-1)). &ast;paYJan evidently also served as a (lexically causative) transitive meaning ' feed (animals)', to judge from its reflexes in Arosi and in Central Pacific languages .

[^14]: In [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross1996d) ([1996d](../references.md#source-Ross1996d)) these forms were shown under POc &ast;kani ('eat') + NOMINALISER. I have changed their presentation here in recognition of the fact that they all in a sense reflect POc &ast;kanaYJ, even though they also reflect changes in the nominalisation process.

[^15]: The productive infix <in>, of PAn antiquity, is infixed after the initial consonant of a base if there is one, but becomes ni- with a vowel-initial base. In Patpatar, Ramoaaina, Tolai and Nehan the &ast;k- of &ast;kani is lost, giving a vowel-initial base.

[^16]: The Bauro gloss provides a clue as to why the Arosi cognate means 'betelpepper': it is an additive to betelnut.

[^17]: Other NNG languages show fragmentary evidence of :such a prefix, e.g. Mangap kaiwos 'edible greens' (< POc &ast;wasa 'Abelmoschus manihot; green vegetables', ch.lO, [§2.1](#s-2-1)) and Atui kamutuk 'ripe coconut' (< POc &ast;matuqu 'ripe, brown coconut', ch.l2, [§3.4](#s-3-4)). A number of PT languages have similar prefixes, but apparently not on all tree names, e.g. Molima ai-, Tawala ke-, Saliba kai-.

[^18]: For Kwara'ae see [Henderson & Hancock](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988)) and [Kwa'ioloa & Burt](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001) ([2001](../references.md#source-KwaioloaandBurt2001)), as well as [Deck's 1934](../references.md#source-Deck1934) grammar. For Wayan Fijian see [Pawley & Sayaba](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003) ([2003](../references.md#source-PawleyandSayaba2003)) and [Gardner & Pawley](../references.md#source-GardnerandPawley2006) ([2006](../references.md#source-GardnerandPawley2006)).

[^19]: See vol.1, ch.2, [§3.2](#s-3-2). A monovalent noun is one which may be directly possessed (Frantisek Lichtenberk 1985), i.e. may take possessor suffixes, e.g. &ast;a qaqe-gu 'my leg'. Such nouns are usually semantically inalien- able. All other nouns are zero-valency nouns and are indirectly possessed, i.e. the possessor suffix is attached to a separate morpheme, e.g. &ast;a na-gu Rumaq 'my house' (Lynch et al. 2002: 76-77).

[^20]: The grammaticisation of [MONOVALENT NOUN &ast;qi] to form numeral classifiers had perhaps already occurred in PEOc ([Pawley 1972](../references.md#source-Pawley1972): 35- 36, 59), but it is possible that SE Solomonic and Polynesian forms represent inde- pendent grammaticisations.

[^21]: The numeral was apparently a verb in this construction.

[^22]: [Henderson & Hancock](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988) ([1988](../references.md#source-HendersonandHancock1988): 277) write that _faʔi_ means 'small tree'. This is not correct: it is used with small trees because no other classifier is more appropriate.

[^23]: The matters discussed in this section and the next are treated in greater detail in [Ross](../references.md#source-Ross2005) ([2005](../references.md#source-Ross2005)b).

[^24]: On SE Solomonic evidence &ast;mala- is probably a grammaticisation of a verb &ast;mala 'resemble'. For Kwaio [Keesing](../references.md#source-Keesing1975) ([1975](../references.md#source-Keesing1975)) records mala- 'prefix of resemblanc(:', mala- 'resemble '. For Arosi [Fox](../references.md#source-Fox1978) ([1978](../references.md#source-Fox1978)) records mara ' like, as; imitate '(mara ia 'like him'). In these languages, the reflex of &ast;mala- evidently remains productive, but I have also found limited evidence of productivity in some languages outside the SE Solomonic group.
